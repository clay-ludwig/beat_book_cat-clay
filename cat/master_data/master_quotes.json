TCPS Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said this submission is the next milestone in the design process.Before the board voted unanimously to submit the design development plan, Shafer and Adam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, gave a presentation to update the board on plans for the project, including the schedule and estimated project costs.McDonald explained that the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and 16,600 square feet of additions.Three total additions at different corners of the building will add additional learning space.\"The additions are also going to help us enhance the overall design of the building,\" McDonald said.Since the board's last update on project plans, McDonald said they have made changes to the addition on the north corner of the building to \"work better with the existing utilities\" during construction.A traffic pattern has been formalized, and a first submission has been made to the State Highway Administration to create an additional curb cut to separate the parent entry loop from the bus drop.\"To help alleviate some of the traffic concerns that come with a shared entrance,\" McDonald said.The design plans for outside also include an extension to the parking lot to provide more space for parents dropping off students.Inside the building, McDonald said that most spaces will remain in the same areas as they are pre-renovation.The main change, he said, is that the media center will move to the front of the building and the art classroom will take over where the current media center is.Currently, bidding for the project is expected to take place in April and May of 2024. Construction would begin in June of 2024 and is estimated to take about two years.The estimated cost of construction and site work is $25.18 million.",

Aye,'\" she said.In most states, those contracts are published only in a school board's minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.But the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state's Open Data Portal.When work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing.Data was missing from several smaller districts, too - even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.Student journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data.The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn't do that until early June.Derek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.A team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.Their key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts - reporters and citizens who live in those districts - will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.In doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them.",

The \"Contracted Out\" database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\"If there is any corruption out there, it's through these contracts,\" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University's Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\"Contracted Out\" gives local journalists and the general public something they've never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.The \"Contracted Out\" database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.The Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use.",

Henry, Maryland's inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\"You know, we don't find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\" Henry said.County or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland.On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.But audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions - and often they don't.",

Noting the district had not received the in-depth responses necessary, Interim Superintendent Matthew Kibler's recommendation mirrored the Committees citing \"major gaps remained despite multiple opportunities to cure deficiencies,\" including: insufficient evidence of operational readiness, staffing, and facility acquisition planning; a pre-K program plan that is not feasible without Maryland Accreditation and EXCELS Level 4 status; financial assumptions that lack contingency planning for enrollment shortfalls, grant delays, or facility overruns; limited and underdeveloped plans for serving students with disabilities, English learners, and other student groups and an instructional program that remains underdeveloped and not adequately aligned with Maryland College and Career Ready Standards.",

And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.Other schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\"Honestly, I'm still reading and learning, and I think that they're doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\" said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold. \"We have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they're going to disseminate to us.\"Miller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school's capacity to meet the need.In March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\"The plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\" Hise said.",

She also talked about getting ready to enroll students in grades six through eight, as well as tenth graders, in MCAP tutorials.Aberg said she hopes to see even greater growth for younger students in the future since the district has implemented a foundational reading program that aligns with the science of reading, or the research behind how students learn to read.Board Member Theresa Stafford asked Aberg what the district did differently last year that might be attributed to the growth in proficiency for elementary students.Aberg mentioned multiple changes including the use of DIBELS test data to \"help drive instruction\" and getting teachers trained in the science of reading.MATHWhen it came to MCAP math assessments, grade seven and Algebra I saw significant increases in proficiency. The percentage of seventh graders that were considered proficient learners increased to 11% from less than 5% the year before.",
