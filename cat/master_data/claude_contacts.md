## Conclusion

This directory covers **84 named contacts** across five Eastern Shore Maryland counties, organized by county school districts, school boards, district administrators, county government officials, state legislators, MSDE regional contacts, teacher unions, advocacy organizations, and community partners. The **Blueprint for Maryland's Future** implementation remains the central education policy issue uniting all stakeholders in this region. Key strategic contacts include **Del. Jefferson Ghrist** for state education appropriations, **Sandra Klunk** at MSDE for regional coordination, and the five superintendents for district-level matters. For media inquiries, each district maintains a PIO or communications contact, with county government PIOs available for budget and funding questions.
