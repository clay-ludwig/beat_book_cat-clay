### Budget & Finances (FY2025)

**Core Fiscal Data:**
- County Operating Budget: $79,208,471
- School System Operating Budget: $100,373,108
- County Local Appropriation: $20,301,228
- State Aid: $79,028,144

- Enrollment: 5,400
- Total Per-Pupil: $19,796
- Local Per-Pupil: $3,760
- State Per-Pupil: $14,630

**Blueprint for Maryland's Future Drivers:**
- Compensatory Education: Major driver; high-poverty formula
- Concentration Of Poverty: Multiple CEP schools
- Special Education: Rising costs, placements
- Pre K Expansion: Creates staffing and space pressures

**Emerging Issues:**
- Heavy Blueprint dependency
- Special education and utilities rising steeply
- Local revenue capacity limited

**County Narrative:**

Caroline County exemplifies the Blueprint-dependent, low-wealth school system. CCPS’s operating budget exceeds the county’s entire general fund, reflecting deep reliance on the state. Poverty-based Blueprint formulas provide essential funding but leave little flexibility for enhanced investments. Rising special education costs, health premiums, and utilities stress operations. A new facilities cycle is emerging, with likely elementary school replacements.

## Dorchester County

### Overview
- **Total Enrollment:** 13,068
- **Number of Schools:** 10
  - Elementary: 6 schools
  - Middle: 2 schools
  - High: 2 schools

### Budget & Finances (FY2025)

**Core Fiscal Data:**
- County Operating Budget: $91,963,965
- School System Operating Budget: $87,624,755
- County Local Appropriation: $26,316,174
- State Aid: $60,438,581

- Enrollment: 4,500
- Total Per-Pupil: $21,009
- Local Per-Pupil: $5,850
- State Per-Pupil: $13,430

**Blueprint for Maryland's Future Drivers:**
- Compensatory Education: Very large allocation
- Concentration Of Poverty: Multiple CEP schools
- Special Education: High and rising
- Pre K: Expansion pressure across buildings

**Emerging Issues:**
- School budget nearly equals county general fund
- Heavy reliance on state capital
- Staffing and fixed costs limit flexibility

**County Narrative:**

Dorchester is one of Maryland’s most state-dependent districts. Local capacity is extremely limited, and DCPS leans heavily on Blueprint aid. High-poverty formulas drive revenue, but reflect deep need. Capital needs—HVAC, roofs, mechanical systems—are significant, with nearly all major projects dependent on state support. Operational costs such as transportation and special education continue to rise.

## Kent County

### Overview
- **Total Enrollment:** 5,082
- **Number of Schools:** 5
  - Elementary: 3 schools
  - Middle: 1 schools
  - High: 1 schools

### Budget & Finances (FY2025)

**Core Fiscal Data:**
- County Operating Budget: $85,275,779
- School System Operating Budget: $35,021,363
- County Local Appropriation: $21,499,813
- State Aid: $11,721,545
- % County Budget to Schools: 25.2%
- Local Share: 61.4%
- State Share: 33.5%

**Per-Pupil Spending:**
- Enrollment: 1,800
- Total Per-Pupil: $21,188
- Local Per-Pupil: $11,940
- State Per-Pupil: $6,510

**Blueprint for Maryland's Future Drivers:**
- Compensatory Ed: Lower than neighbors
- Special Ed: Very high per-pupil cost
- Ccr: Modest expansion

**Emerging Issues:**
- Most locally dependent system in the region
- Inefficient cost structure due to small size
- Retention challenges vs. wealthier neighbors

**County Narrative:**

Kent faces structural inefficiencies from being a very small school district. With ~1,800 students, fixed costs consume a large share of resources, and limited Blueprint funding leaves taxpayers bearing the burden. Staffing, programming options, and capital renewal all face challenges due to scale. Deferred maintenance is becoming a significant concern.

## Queen Annes County

### Overview
- **Total Enrollment:** 22,434
- **Number of Schools:** 14
  - Elementary: 8 schools
  - Middle: 4 schools
  - High: 2 schools

### Budget & Finances (FY2025)

**Core Fiscal Data:**
- County Operating Budget: $209,064,803
- School System Operating Budget: $127,507,215
- County Local Appropriation: $82,729,260
- State Aid: $43,557,955

**Per-Pupil Spending:**
- Enrollment: 8,000
- Total Per-Pupil: $17,662
- Local Per-Pupil: $10,340
- State Per-Pupil: $5,440

**Blueprint for Maryland's Future Drivers:**
- Special Ed: Major cost center
- Ccr: Strong expansion
- Pre K: Increasing space pressures
- Cep: Fewer CEP schools than lower-wealth counties

**Emerging Issues:**
- Highest fiscal effort in the region
- Transportation and plant operations cost growth
- Enrollment growth will drive future capital needs

**County Narrative:**

Queen Anne's is the region’s highest-capacity local funder, directing nearly 40% of its general fund to education. Strong local revenue allows for robust staffing, CCR pathways, and program expansion. But rising enrollment, transportation costs, and future modernization projects will require sustained investment.

- Capital needs beginning to accumulate

**County Narrative:**

Talbot sits between the region’s higher-wealth and lower-wealth districts. TCPS relies on strong state support plus a county surtax. Blueprint requirements—CCR, career ladder, pre-K—are steadily increasing costs. Capital needs are accumulating, pointing toward an upcoming modernization cycle.
