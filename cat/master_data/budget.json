CCPS’s operating budget exceeds the county’s entire general fund, reflecting deep reliance on the state. Poverty-based Blueprint formulas provide essential funding but leave little flexibility for enhanced investments. Rising special education costs, health premiums, and utilities stress operations. A new facilities cycle is emerging, with likely elementary school replacements."

High-poverty formulas drive revenue, but reflect deep need. Capital needs—HVAC, roofs, mechanical systems—are significant, with nearly all major projects dependent on state support. Operational costs such as transportation and special education continue to rise."
