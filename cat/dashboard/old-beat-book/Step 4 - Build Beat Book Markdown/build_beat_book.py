"""
Iteratively build a beat book for Talbot County reporting by processing stories in random batches.
Uses a two-stage process:
1. Local Ollama gemma3:4b reads stories and takes notes
2. OpenAI GPT-5.2 refines the beat book and outputs talbot_beat_book.md

This is a local variant of build_beat_book_groq.py that uses Ollama instead of Groq,
allowing faster iteration without cloud API rate limits or timeouts.

<word_count>
Current: ~{word_count} words. Target: 5,000 words. Please trim when appropriate to match the target.
</word_count>

<instructions>
Update the beat book in `beat_book.md` to incorporate the new information. Your priorities:

1. **Synthesize, don't catalog** - This is NOT a collection of story summaries. Combine information from multiple sources into unified sections about topics, people, and institutions. If multiple notes mention the same person, school, or issue, merge that information into one place.
2. **Focus on the big picture** - What are the major ongoing issues? Who are the key players? What should a reporter know to cover this beat effectively? Avoid one-off events unless they reveal larger patterns.
3. **Organize by topic, not by source** - Structure the beat book around subjects (budget, schools, personnel, programs) rather than individual stories or batches.
4. **Talbot County, Maryland only** - cut information about other counties or states.
5. **No citations** - Do NOT mention specific articles, reporters, publication dates, or "according to" attributions. Present information as established fact.
6. **Narrative style** - flowing paragraphs, not bullet points (except for contact lists).
</instructions>

<writing_style>
Write prose that is direct, clear, and substantive. Prioritize:

- **Short paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences max. One idea per paragraph. White space helps readers. This is journalism, not academia.
- **Natural flow over formality**: Write like you're explaining something to a smart colleague, not drafting a legal document. Vary sentence length. Let ideas breathe.
- **Precision without stiffness**: Use concrete details and specific names, but avoid the mechanical cadence of typical institutional writing. "The board approved a $2.3 million budget" beats "The board gave their approval to a budget in the amount of $2.3 million."
- **Honest about scope**: If something is unclear or limited, say so briefly and move on. Don't pad with qualifiers or hedge excessively.
- **No filler**: Cut "it should be noted that," "it is important to mention," "as previously stated," and similar throat-clearing. Start with the information.
- **Active voice, strong verbs**: "The superintendent restructured the curriculum" not "The curriculum was restructured by the superintendent."

**CRITICAL - Do NOT editorialize or make meta-commentary:**
- NEVER write phrases like "at the intersection of," "serves as a reminder that," "underscores the importance of," "highlights the challenges," "reflects broader trends," "speaks to the"
- NEVER tell the reader what something "means" or "suggests" or "illustrates" - just state what happened
- NEVER frame things as "notable," "significant," "important," or "worth noting" - if it's in the beat book, it's already deemed relevant
- NEVER use "amid" or "amidst" to create false drama
- NEVER write sentences that could start with "This shows that..." or "This demonstrates..." - just give the facts
- You are a reporter, not a commentator. State what happened. Let readers draw conclusions.

**Avoid these AI-generated phrases entirely:**
- "at the intersection of X and Y"
- "serves as a testament to"
- "underscores/highlights/illustrates the"
- "speaks to the broader"
- "reflects the challenges/realities of"
- "a reminder that"
- "in an era of"
- "navigating the complexities of"
- "a microcosm of"
- "emblematic of"
- "a window into"
- "it's not just X — it's Y"

The goal is prose that a reader trusts because it respects their time and intelligence.
