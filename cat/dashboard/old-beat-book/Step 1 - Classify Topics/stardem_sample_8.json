    "content": "‘Ahead of the curve’: Maryland realtors not as affected by NAR settlement\n\n September 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A $418 million settlement by the National Association of Realtors has brought forth changes to traditional practices of how broker commissions are paid. Maryland realtors, however, aren't having to adjust as much as their counterparts.The settlement was reached in May after class-action lawsuits by home sellers alleged antitrust violations stemming from requirements placed on listing brokers. The NAR denied any wrongdoing in connection to those claims.\nIn the wake of the settlement, two key changes from the NAR went into effect in August. First, homebuyers must sign a written agreement with an agent before that agent provides any services to the buyer. Second, offers of compensation from a seller to a buyer's agent may no longer be shared on multiple listing services, which are marketplaces for realtors.\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' stance on the changes is that there is now an increased sense of transparency for homebuyers and sellers.\n\"The lawsuit was really about transparency and how (buyer's agents are) getting paid,\" Shelby Roney, board president, said. \"And it kind of makes you reiterate why you should be paid.\"\nRoney, a realtor for Benson & Mangold Real Estate, said Maryland won't be feeling that first change as much as other states. She pointed out that Maryland has had buyer's agency since 1999, noting a law enacted in 2016 that required written buyer agency agreements.\nMaryland realtors representing potential buyers are used to signing those written agreements, detailing to the buyer what services the agent will provide and at what cost. The national rule will reinforce that routine and force buyers and agents to sign agreements that are even clearer in outlining how much commission will cost for the agent.\n\"We've always been very proactive and ahead of the game, ahead of the curve,\" Roney said of Maryland.\nMeanwhile, other states that did not have clear buyer's agency law had to quickly adjust to the new requirements.\n\"They were already freaking out before March,\" Roney said of other states. \"When I was in California, there were agents from all over the country, and most of them did not have anything resembling buyer's agency. And it was very concerning for them, that they were nowhere prepared. How to explain it, how to even enforce it, how to word it, their state laws were going to have to change.\"\nThe increased focus on explicit buyer's agency agreements only furthers the advantages of a buyer paying their own agent rather than relying on a sub-agent during the buying process, Roney said.\nSub-agents are agents unaffiliated from the listing real estate broker but paid by the seller or seller's agent to assist prospective buyers. They do not work for the same company as the seller's agent.\nSub-agency is still alive in the state, according to Roney. However, sub-agents are only able to provide so much help to buyers since their loyalties are only to the seller. For prospective buyers, having a dedicated buyer's agent is beneficial.\n\"It's the biggest investment that you're going to make in your lifetime,\" she said of buying a home. Roney did note that many first-time homebuyers have benefitted from the seller paying the commission for an agent.\nThe option for a seller to offer compensation to a buyer's agent is still available, Roney said, though not through multiple listing service databases. Now, it'll be clear to buyers before any agreement is signed.\nThe benefits of having a buyer's agent are significant for buyers, especially when housing prices rise, the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors says. It'll also help realtors understand their value and be upfront about what \"tier\" of services they will offer depending on the compensation rate.\n\"You have to know your value and you have to explain your value, and you also have to decide what your tiers (of service) are,\" Roney said. \" … Where do you want me to work for you?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum celebrates 60 years\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 737\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST.MICHAELS — A staple of St. Michaels, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is celebrating 60 years.Volunteers spearheaded the creation of the museum, which opened in 1965 at Navy Point and was accredited in 1978.\n\"The museum really started out by a community effort,\" said Pete Lesher, chief historian and ambassador at large at the museum. \"The collections were built with an outpouring from the community over the idea that the place is changing and we need to establish a museum to remember the way it was.\"\nLesher, came to the museum in 1991 as a curator. He said the museum was created in a \"series of themes\" to represent the Bay and people around the it.\nMUSEUM HISTORY\nThe museum started in May 1965 with two buildings that had been on the grounds since 1850 the Higgins house and the Dodson house. The eagle house building arrived in 1870. The three buildings now serve as administrative buildings after serving as exhibit buildings for nine years in the early days.\nAccording to Lesher, the land where the museum's lighthouse and other exhibits now sit was reclaimed from the Bay.\n\"This was just a shallow part of the park,\" Lesher said. \"You would have been standing probably knee deep sinking into mud about 150 years ago.\n\"This area started with actually a sawmill and grist mill but moved beyond that to seafood packing houses, and by the height here in the 1930s and 1940s, there were four different seafood packing houses out on this point. Every time they wanted to expand, they simply discarded more oyster shells, which they end up on themselves, pushing them into the harbor and built more land.\"\nWilliam Coulbourne and Frederick Jewett were two African American business owners who owned one of the four businesses on the land.\n\"They were early 20th century Black entrepreneurs from Crisfield, Maryland, who moved up here,\" Lesher said. \"They learned the business and managed to get somebody to sell them land and managed to get somebody to give them a bank loan — a remarkable success story.\"\nThe museum plans to honor Coulbourne and Jewitt by renaming its education building after the two entrepreneurs.\nThe lighthouse, which is featured in the museum's logo, is the first historical structure the museum collected. It was acquired in 1966 when the Coast Guard was demolishing lighthouses \"left and right\" because of vandalism, according to Lesher.\nThe museum bought the lighthouse from the demolition company and moved it 50 miles north to the museum site.\n\"It was so early in our history, it became our logo,\" Lesher said. \"The lighthouse is sort of what identifies the museum.\"\nOne of the new changing exhibits at the museum is the Sailing to Freedom exhibit, which highlights the Underground Railroad on the water.\n\"So we think of the Underground Railroad like the Harriet Tubman story of running up the Delmarva Peninsula to get to Philadelphia and freedom,\" Lesher said.\n\"Well, a lot of people made it by boat, whether they got a ticket on a steamboat, got away that way or stowed away on a coast-wise schooner, so many of them on the Chesapeake Bay, while the Chesapeake Bay forms a natural watery highway to the north. This was a route to freedom for many of those freedom seekers,\" he said. \"That's what we try to show with this exhibit.\"\nHELPING THE COMMUNITY\nIn addition to exhibits for museum-goers, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum uses some exhibits to help with the curriculum in Talbot County schools.\nAn exhibit displaying the Maryland Crab Meat Company sits where the museum holds the Chesapeake's Best Crab Cakes program, in which third and fifth graders receive math, reading and social studies credits in the curriculum.\n\"The Chesapeake's Best Crab Cakes program meets learning goals for for math, for reading and for social studies in the Maryland curriculum,\" Lesher said. \"Every Talbot County third grader and fifth grader has an experience tied to their curriculum, tied to their learning goals right here in the museum.\"\nThe museum also conducts an apprenticeship program where museum staff work with an apprentice for two years, ultimately leading to a state credential.\nAccording to Lesher, the museum has hired some of these apprentices as permanent shipyard crew.\nThe museum has partnered with the St. Michaels Community Center on multiple occasions.\n\"We're working to do more community collaborations with them because both our missions align, and we want to enrich the lives of people who live in St. Michaels,\" said Amy Horne, executive director of the community center. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Author publishes 10th novel - BOOKS & AUTHORS\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6A | Section: News \n \n 1031\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Louise Gorday published her latest book, \"Letter of the Law,\" in late August through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing.Many of Gorday's 10 novels center on life in a small fictional Southern Maryland town based loosely on Chesapeake Beach.The award-winning author has started writing her 11th novel, a historical fiction murder mystery set in 1923.Gorday lives in Dunkirk with her very patient husband, two Shelties, and Emmett, an African Grey who can sing the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" theme song.\"I could blame it on a stapler,\" she said of writing. \"Or maybe it was the Scotch tape, the dog ear, or the occasional white paste. Whatever it was, once I found I could join pieces of paper and write stories, I was forever enthralled by this great adventure called writing.\" \"Letter of the Law\" can be found at Amazon.com or for more information about Louise Gorday, go to How long have you been writing, and how did you get started?Creative writing - poetry and short stories - has been a passion of mine since grade school. I attempted my first novel when I was 14, and throughout the years, writing a book was always an ambition.Professionally speaking, I have been writing since 2010.About 13 years ago, I was thinking about how my mother used to refer to me as \"Annie off the pickle boat.\" Suddenly, I realized that I had no idea what that meant, so I started researching the saying.Fishing boats that pickled their catch would slow down as they returned to port. Hence, my mother's phrase referred to someone bringing up the rear.Then the literary muse stepped in and paired pickling boats and the nickname of a historic, unrenovated, old beach house in Chesapeake Beach (Orphan Annie), and voila, my first novel \"The Pickle Boat House\" was born.From there, I've branched off into nine other novels that include historical fiction and fantasy.What inspires you to write?Everything. I love tying bits and pieces of information together - letting my mind wander and create. In Southern Maryland, we are blessed with stunning landscapes and so many natural wonders (Battle Creek Cypress Swamp, Calvert Cliffs), and fabulous history (the amusement park at Chesapeake Beach, Moll Dyer witch tale) is all around us. I write about these things, spinning them into stories with hopefully likable fictional characters.I also often write with underlying themes: grief, sibling rivalry, jealousy, and selfishness, for example. \"Letter of the Law\" tackles issues of father-son relationships.And then there is my sense of humor. Humor underlies much of what I write because I'm tickled by a lot of things.Do you consider writing to be a career?Yes, a second career. I've been writing continually for 10 years and I'll continue as long as the muse keeps shoving stories at me.What kind of writing process do you use?Typically, I get up every morning, eat breakfast, and then open up my laptop to my latest work in progress. I read through what I wrote the previous day, usually hate most of it, and start revising. Before I know it, I'm putting down new material. I usually work with a goal of writing a certain number of words each day. When I reach that number, I close up shop and walk away to do other things.My first novel took 2½ years to write. Later ones have taken as little as six to seven months.It all depends on how giving the muse is. I've spent the last 10 years working with the same editor. He's terrific and taught me a lot about writing.I would never publish a book without an editorial review.Who are some of your favorite authors and why?I love Michael Connelly's \"Bosch\" and \"Lincoln Lawyer\" series. His writing is so crisp and clear, and his plots are always fresh. Neil Gaiman is another favorite. His imagination is spectacular. They have a substantial impact on how I write, but maybe not in the way one would think. I look at their sentence structures, the way they move characters around, change scenes, end chapters; the technical stuff.That's what I retain and how I improve my writing skills. I try to learn from the masters.What do you want readers to know about you?I'm a quiet, reflective person with a wild imagination and a sly sense of humor, and these traits readily show up in my stories. Also, that I'm an intensely proud Marylander.I grew up in Clinton and I've lived in Calvert County for over 25 years. I love sharing Southern Maryland through my writing.And finally, I want to share that I work hard at what I do with the intent of providing an entertaining immersive experience. Story development, editing, and book cover designs, I want to put out the very best book that I can for readers to enjoy.Please include a brief description of your book: \"Letter of the Law\" is in the fantasy genre about Hamelin Russell, an immortal who is assigned to run messages between the Weigh Station (a purgatory-like place in the afterlife) and the pearly gates.Hamelin has been stuck in the afterlife for over 700 years; not good enough to enter heaven, and not bad enough to be condemned to hell. He hopes that this latest assignment will finally get him to the promised land.Please include an excerpt from the book: Chapter One: The Door This was the view that greeted those God saved?Hamelin looked right, then left, then straight ahead again.He saw no St. Peter marking names off a list so long and unwieldy that it spilled off his desk and stretched endlessly into the distance. No twinkling stardust or chorus of angels singing anthems of praise just inside gates of glistening pearl, and no white, shining city bathed in ethereal light on the other side of a tall marble wall. There simply was no other side. He stared off into black, limitless space. He had delivered judged souls to paradise for eons, but he had never come this far. He had transferred them into heavenly care at the portal entrance some hundred yards away. How him as Ezekiel, although he probably went by many names. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF BETH GRAEME PHOTOGRAPHY\n \nAuthor Louise Gorday of Dunkirk, who recently published her 10th novel, \"Letter of the Law,\" said, \"Once I found I could join pieces of paper and write stories, I was forever enthralled by this great adventure called writing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, a state funded program is working to expand high speed internet access to these areas.\"One of the cool things about this is that a majority of the people on this list, except for the people who came forward, don't even know they're getting broadband coming to their homes,\" said Dorchester County grant writer Marylin Williams.\nThe Maryland Homestretch — Difficult To Serve Properties Program is administered by the Maryland Office of State Broadband and provides funding for internet installation in areas where it can be particularly expensive. The program is also referred to as the Long Driveway Internet Program.\nWilliams referred to the program as \"ever changing,\" saying the state modified the grant program as recently as this spring.\nThis came in handy when the amount initially awarded to the county was not enough to cover projected costs for the project.\nInitially, the county was granted $1.1 million, but the project is estimated to cost $2,422,493. The county was recently awarded with a higher grant after Williams advocated for more homes to be covered.\nHowever, The grant still will not cover all of the 299 homes approved to be serviced, so energy companies Bay Country and Choptank Electric are investing in the county to ensure access, Williams said.\nChoptank Electric spokesperson Valerie Connelly and Williams requested two action items from the Cambridge County Council at the June 3 County Council meeting.\nThe first item is accepting the higher grant award of $1,217,852. The second is having the county sign a memorandum of understanding with Choptank Electric and Bay Country. The Commissioners unanimously agreed, with County Commissioner Ricky Travers leading the motion.\nAccording to Connelly, broadband will be installed at no cost to the homeowners and all construction must be completed by Dec. 31, per the grant. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Teachers would spin a wheel, and the number that they get would correlate to a challenge. The challenges included writing a paragraph of praise to a fellow teacher and sending it to the principal to give the message anonymously.\nHaley Wright, a teacher at Maple Elementary, said she had a lot of fun this week. She enjoyed the appreciation she received from staff and the chance to connect with other teachers at the school.\n\"It allows teachers who may not always see each other or maybe they're able to establish new friendships among their staff members. The kids really get into it,\" Wright said. \"On their morning announcements, students asked staff to ask us, 'Did we spin the wheel?' 'What challenge are we going to work on today?' So I think it also allows for the students to get excited about it, too.\"\nNatalie Drake, teacher at Maple Elementary, said she enjoyed the work that the administration put into this week, especially while making it a team activity. Drake described how teachers and support staff were split into teams to earn points to be the winning team at the end of the week.\nBy far, Drake's favorite part was feeling seen by other teachers and staff at the school.\n\"I did receive one of those anonymous emails today, and that really just put a smile on my face,\" Drake said. \"Other people here at school recognize the hard work that we all put in. They're very appreciative of all that we do here. So not just our administration appreciates us, but also our colleagues are appreciative of us.\"\nFor Ford, teachers work hard all year, and with standardized testing, it is easy for everyone to feel a bit burned out this time of the year. These events are meant to refresh everyone and provide a positive outlet for energy for teachers, staff and students.\n\"Teaching is hard. But it's fun, and it's rewarding,\" Ford said. \"I enjoy seeing my teachers in action, their passion, and you can truly tell that they care about all of their students, and it just makes me feel good. It makes me proud to be the principal here and just proud to be able to work with such amazing educators.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Commissioner Brian Schmidt was nominated as President of the council and Commissioner Walter Chase was nominated as Vice President.At the meeting, a representative from McHale Landscape addressed the council and proposed improving drainage issues affecting Scott's United Methodist Church.\nThe church's garden club would pay for the improvements. The council discussed getting an engineering review from GMB Engineering before proceeding to ensure it wouldn't overwhelm infrastructure.\nThe council later discussed bids for the Water Service Line Inventory Projects. At least six bids were received, ranging from $19,850 to up to $200,942, with added alternatives.\nThe council aimed to review the proposals and narrow it down to three or four companies to interview and finalize a selection at a workshop in April. The council wanted to ensure the selected company could do field investigations and help with funding applications. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In it, Roberts explained Article II authority in the U.S. Constitution \"generally includes the ability to remove executive officials.\"\nHe also says that is \"a power that is necessary to ensure the accountable and effective execution of federal policy.\"\nShapiro also notes that Roberts has stated, without the power to remove executive branch officers, \"the president could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\"\nThe key word in Chief Justice Roberts thinking is \"generally.\"\nThe Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines \"generally\" as often or regularly.\nIt does not define \"generally\" as \"always.\"\nThat is affirmed by recent actions by Chief Justice Roberts on two lower court rulings on DOGE.\nIn the first action Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the Supreme Court's left-of-center bloc of justices in blocking President Trump's efforts to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid funding and temporarily blocking budget cuts.\nIn the second action, Roberts and Coney Barrett agreed with a majority of their left-of-center colleagues on a decision that the court would not overrule a temporary order from a lower court to stop Trump from firing the head of the Office of Special Counsel.\nThese two actions refute the idea that members of the conservative bloc are unified and consistently unable to reach agreement with members of the left-of-center Justices.\nIt also demonstrates that Roberts and Coney Barrett are willing to side against Trump in legal challenges on certain DOGE Issues.\nMost importantly, it affirms that the issue of presidential authority and power will require extraordinarily intense dialogue and deliberations among all the justices on the short-term and long-term ramifications of their ultimate decisions.\nPayvan Ahdout, a law professor at the University of Virginia, suggests the court is \"open to a role for judicial review of these [DOGE] decisions, but they just have not yet reached consensus on what that judicial role should be.\"\nGoing forward, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Coney Barrett could be part of majority member rulings that all, most, some or few of DOGE actions are unconstitutional or could be constitutional with revisions.\nIf both do so, the outcomes will be 6-3 majority rulings for DOGE.\nIf only one does, it will still be 5-4 rulings for DOGE.\nConversely, if both join again with three of left-of-center justices to sustain lower court challenges against DOGE it will be 5-4 rulings against DOGE.\nUltimately, every Supreme Court review and ruling on every lower court DOGE ruling will determine the future scope of DOGE's constitutional authority, plans, efforts, success or failure to meet projected results. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were lots of booths. Some served Ridgely Fire Department's famous pork parfait, and others gave out information on community services like CASA of Caroline.\nThere were three stages cranking out live music from singer-songwriters, Mike Elzy's students, blue grass artists and funk band G Method. The belly dancing crew of Sammati Dance was even seen dancing with swords balanced on the their heads.\nKeith Shaffer, in his best radio announcer voice, called people together for the opening ceremony Friday evening.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Summerfest. In preparation for the opening ceremony in front of the Caroline County Courthouse. Please make way for one of Caroline County's finest marching bands- The North Caroline High School Marching Band of Blue,\" Shaffer said.\nThe blue river of high school students with flutes and tubas and snare drums stopped in front of the courthouse. They played the Star Spangled Banner. Then, Mayor Abby McNinch got on the courthouse steps and declared the 2024 Summerfest officially open.\nLater after the kids played their song and the color guard raised the flag. Frank Bartz, a Caroline County commissioner, said, \"I like seeing all the people from the county in all different towns come together and enjoy themselves and enjoy summer. This is a great collaboration between The Arts Council, County, town and Parks and Recreation.\"\nJaimie Beechey, director of Caroline Recreation and Parks said, \"(Summerfest) was started by the town of Denton and Caroline County in 1989. So this is the 35th year. Logistics-wise, it is such a well-oiled machine between the town, who have a lot of people who have been there a long time, and Recreation and Parks and the county. There are so many people that have been picking this up, that logistically it is just a little tweaking. What is hard is how much money we need to raise to make this happen.\"\nSummerfest leans heavily on its generous local sponsors to fund the many activities offered each year. The event typically draws between 5,000 and 8,000 visitors, Beechey said.\nHallie Readores, a program specialist, had on a mad hatter's black hat with playing cards in the sash around the brim. She took the year's literary theme and ran with it to Alice's Wonderland. She ran a fun, tunnel-like attraction that people had to crawl in to get inside.\n\"We wanted to bring Alice In Wonderland to life,\" she said. \"Once you go down the rabbit hole, like the classic story, you decorate a mad hatter's hat. Tomorrow we will have a little tea party surprise. Everyone seems to be loving it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I hope the following encouraging tips from your fellow readers on how to be a frugal rockstar will inspire all of us to pay attention and embrace ways we can immediately begin to see more money left in our wallets.Over the past six months, I've been on a tear to declutter and get organized. It has made a huge impact on my spending.Basically, I've stopped spending money on stuff I have already but just didn't know where to find it. The key is knowing what you have and finding it when needed. If you can't find your stuff easily, you might buy something you already have or, even worse, believe you got rid of it, buy a replacement, and then find the original shortly after. - Millie, New Jersey We have a new weekly menu item at our house - Everything But the Kitchen Sink Soup. Basically, this is just throwing a bunch of whateveris-in-the-fridge to make a soup in order to get rid of stuff that's about to go bad or otherwise needs to be used up. You can put so much stuff into soups, and you can freeze leftover soup, too. Really helps to prevent food waste. If you need instructions on how to do this, look up Cotter-Crunch.com. When you get there, use the search function to find that \"recipe.\" - Erica, California I started using grocery delivery during the pandemic. Even taking into consideration the monthly/annual delivery fee, I've stuck with it because it significantly reduces my impulse buys, which continues to save us money. And we have all but eliminated spending on junk food. - Molly, Pennsylvania \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Elmer Davis. \"You three will be remembered for opening this door,\" he said, adding that other groups may now have the ability to obtain festival permits.\nShari Wilcoxon, who wrote to the council in the winter asking for the festival to be held on West Street instead of South Harrison Street, called Monday evening for the council to be \"apolitical.\"\n\"Would you fully support … a Moms for Liberty parade?\" Wilcoxon asked. \"Would you pay for banners?\"\nMONTGOMERY COMMENTS\nMeanwhile, other meeting attendees addressed Montgomery's comments from the June 3 meeting, which included a claim of \"danger to our community from promotion of (the) transexual ideology.\"\n\"By saying that Pride, the Pride flag or any section of our LGBT community is merely an ideology overlooks what the essence of Pride is: a celebration of human rights and the recognition of inherent dignity of all individuals regardless of their (sexual) orientation or gender identity,\" Mayor Megan Cook said at the outset of Monday's meeting.\nMontgomery responded, saying he \"did not appreciate being chastised\" by Cook. The mayor said they will likely not ever \"see eye-to-eye on social issues,\" but that she hopes everyone can keep an \"open mind.\"\n\"What I'm trying to do is to be helpful to those who are being misled by what I think is clearly an ideology, and it's demonstrated by the way my comments were received last month,\" Montgomery said. \"Shouting someone down in an effort of de-platforming simply proves we are dealing with an ideology and a political movement.\"\nJen Wagner, a St. Michaels resident who owns a business in Easton, took to the podium to call for the resignation of Gunsallus and Montgomery, to which the Town Council president said \"that's too far.\"\n\"I will not prolong this debate tonight on facts or their interpretation,\" Montgomery said at the meeting's end. \"I will object to personal attacks, which exclusively came from the audience directed in this direction.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — During the St. Michaels Commissioners meeting on Wednesday, St. Michaels Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald said the police department will lose an 18-year veteran officer to another municipality. The officer, he said, is leaving for better pay.\"I'm coming up on my 24th year here, three as chief, and during this time, I've seen 43 officers come and go in our agency,\" Oswald said. \"Obviously, there are several factors that contribute to some of the turnover, but the prominent and consistent driver from the exit interviews has been paying upward mobility.\"\nStarting on Thursday, the St. Michaels Police Department will be operating with only four officers, excluding Oswald.\nOswald mentioned one of the reasons that officers leave besides salary is opportunities larger departments can provide.\n\"They have criminal investigation divisions, they have training divisions dedicated solely to ensure officers meet certifications, qualifications and criminal updates… and remember, each of these on their own is a full-time specially trained position,\" Oswald said. \"... Every St. Michaels Police Department (officer) must be able to perform every one of these rules at any given time, and therefore, after a few years, an officer builds a strong resume and they take it to another agency who's more than happy to pay them some extra money.\"\nOswald suggested potentially hiring a police recruiting firm and raising wages commensurate to officers' total years of service.\n\"We're a good place to have an opportunity to do a reset because there's only four of us remaining,\" Oswald said.\nAccording to Town Manager Don Richardson, the police department has four openings with two each at the corporal and sergeant level.\nWith potential salary raises, the cost would be north of $200,000 for the town to properly recruit and retain officers, Richardson said.\nCommissioner Alexis Roiter mentioned accommodation taxes, which are paid by tourists who stay at hotels or rental properties, as a potential revenue source for police department needs. Commissioner David Wojciechowski mentioned allocating funds from town events.\nThe commissioners agreed to draft legislation allowing for salary amendments so the St. Michaels Police Department can become competitive in hiring and retention. The measure would have to go through the town's typical legislative process, which would include public hearings, before it can be adopted.\n\"Thank you for supporting this important need for the town of St. Michaels and our community,\" Richardson said. \"It will ultimately require some level of budgeting amendment that will absolutely go through a public comment period and a legislative ordinance.\"\nThe town encourages anyone interested in joining the St. Michaels Police Department to contact the town for further instruction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The drive serves as a perfect way to make room for new gifts this holiday season and show children the joy of giving, Leann Rhodes, Tides of Grace executive director, said.\nToys will be collected from drop off locations starting at midnight, Dec. 6 and volunteer elves will come out for an extravagant Christmas pajama party at The Edge Arena to sort and lay all the goodies across the 25,000 square-foot edge arena.\nFrom 7 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Dec. 7, Christmas magic will welcome registered parents to shop for free toys for children ages infant to 17.\nThis jolly big event is designed for parents only, with children left at home to maintain the element of surprise.\nNo income verification is required, but parents must register ahead of time.\nThis event takes a total of 200 volunteers from the community starting from midnight on Friday, Dec. 6 through the morning hours of Saturday, Dec. 7 to make it possible.\n\"It's really awesome to see the community come together in such a big way,\" Rhodes said.\nThe annual event began in 2020 with a group of moms wanting to spread holiday cheer, and it has grown tremendously over the years, from helping 100 children in 2020 to over 600 children in 2023, she said.\nDonators are asked to ensure toys are in working condition and keep all parts together with a bag to prevent them from getting lost during sorting.\nThe drive is not accepting stuffed animals, used clothes, or books this year.\nDrop off locations are located throughout the Eastern Shore with volunteers available to arrange pickups if donations can't be dropped off in person.\n\"Together, we can spread joy and ensure that every child in our community feels the love this holiday season,\" Rhodes said.\nMore information including child registration and drop off locations can be found at tidesofgraceinc.org/christmas-magic. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At each community space, the established meadows will be highly visible and a welcome improvement to existing landscapes. They will also serve to educate the community on the benefits of river-friendly practices that function as native bird and pollinator habitat.The towns of Preston, Oxford, and Chestertown can expect to witness the various stages of turf to meadow conversion. Early in the process, residents and visitors should notice less green as the current vegetation is removed to make way for seed planting in late winter. During the first two years of establishment, periodic mowing will occur to help reduce intrusion from invasive species. Around year three, the meadow will be humming with insects pollinating the colorful, seasonal flowers. Each of these projects will take time to complete, but will provide countless benefits both aesthetically and to native plant and pollinator habitat, and for climate change resiliency.In 2017, ShoreRivers developed its River-Friendly Yards program to inspire and empower residents to become environmental stewards of their own properties through direct action such as reducing turf grass, eliminating lawn fertilizer, planting natives, installing rain gardens, and increasing buffers along rivers, creeks, and ditches. A River-Friendly Yard mimics the natural environment to benefit water quality, native birds and pollinators, and our local ecosystem. The program now encompasses River-Friendly campuses, congregations, communities, and roadsides.The G3 Program is funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region III, West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and supports the design and implementation of green streets, community greening, and urban tree canopy projects that enhance livability in cities and communities.In addition to funding the conversion of these meadows, the program is also providing funding for ShoreRivers to design multiple green infrastructure projects at St. Mary's Refuge ofSinners Church in Cambridge. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF SHORERIVERS\n \nShoreRivers is in the process of establishing perennial wildflower meadows at James T.

Talbot Family Network, the board responsible for the county's youth and family services, will serve as the commission.\nAfter the public hearing yielded no comments, the council moved the bill to third reading and approved it 4-0. Council member Lynn Mielke abstained.\nThe county must use the money for community-based initiatives, as defined by state law, such as after-school, behavioral health, housing or homeless prevention programs. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. faces alarming 'problems without passports'\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - The man with the most interesting job in government receives a daily diet of information so potentially abundant, and often alarming, that it must challenge his phlegmatic disposition. William J. Burns, 67, the first career diplomat to serve as CIA director, is calm in the eye of the unending storm of international crises, which involves what he called, at a July conference in England, \"problems without passports,\" including pandemics.Hostile potential uses of biotechnology, including engineered viruses, are, Burns thinks, \"among the scariest things.\" Malign actors surely noticed the enormous self-inflicted costs - monetary and cultural - that U.S. policies imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Cyber vulnerabilities suggest that destruction on a scale that used to be assigned to fleets of bombers can now be done with computer clicks: In 1995, a rogue trader for Barings Bank inadvertently destroyed the 233-year old institution.Imagine what can be done intentionally to physical (electric grids, communications systems, hospitals, etc.) as well as financial infrastructure.Oxford-educated and seasoned by foreign-policy immersion that began in the Reagan administration, Burns served as the ambassador to Moscow (2005-2008), where he got to know Vladimir Putin. In November 2021, when the U.S. intelligence community clearly saw Russia's preparations for invading Ukraine, Burns went to Moscow and spoke with Putin.The CIA director was alarmed when he went, and more so when he left Moscow convinced of Putin's \"tragic and brutish fixation\" on Ukraine, a fixation unaltered by \"the clarity of our understanding of what he was planning.\" Putin's invasion has been, Burns says, a strategic blunder with Russia's \"military weaknesses laid bare; its economy badly damaged for years to come; its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes; its revanchist ambitions blunted by a NATO which has only grown bigger and stronger.\" Putin thought his window of opportunity regarding Ukraine was closing. Chinese President Xi Jinping, contemplating what he might think is an opening regarding the seizure of Taiwan, is surely watching what Burns calls Ukraine's \"breathtaking determination and resolve\" - and the possible weakening of U.S. support for Ukraine.On the CIA's leafy Northern Virginia campus, the agency has a large cadre of analysts debating whether, for example, the world has passed \"peak China\" - the apogee of China's might. Or whether there is any historical precedent for a rapid military buildup comparable to China's that has not been followed by war. A perennial intelligence problem is to decide how a nation's intentions can be inferred from the capabilities it develops.Today, the agency's remit extends to helping the Commerce Department understand the security implications of globalization's thick web of supply chains. We are, Burns says, in a \"plastic moment,\" when much is in flux.Intelligence successes often are secret because they concern crises prevented, and/or because publicity would reveal espionage sources and methods. Known successes - e.g., Navy codebreakers turned the tide of the Pacific war in the battle of Midway during World War II - are fewer than the known failures (Pearl Harbor, Bay of Pigs, Iraq's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction). About the CIA's limited ability to explain itself, Burns is laconic: \"It comes with the territory.\" Cambridge University historian Calder Walton, in his new book \"Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West,\" says there was a time when \"the CIA was so bereft of intelligence on China that it resorted to buying fish and chips in Hong Kong, to read the newspapers from the mainland they were wrapped in.\" In many ways, technology - \"smart cities,\" facial recognition, people using smartphones - can make societies more transparent and more porous to outside influences.We are, Burns says, in a \"profound transformation of espionage tradecraft\": \"We recently used social media - our first video post to Telegram, in fact - to let brave Russians know how to contact us safely on the dark web. We had 2.5 million views in the first week.\" There are and always will be, however, \"secrets we need a human to collect, and clandestine operations that only a human can execute\": \"That requires intensive training, an intensive team effort to support operations, and immense creativity and appetite for risk. It still, however, remains central to our mission.\" This is good to know. It would be a loss to literature were the intelligence-gathering wonders wrought by technology to totally supplant the derring-do that made Eric Ambler and John le Carré possible.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: GEORGE F.

Disparate views of Trump's immigration crackdowns, deportations\n\n April 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1206\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Donald Trump's immigration raids and promises of mass deportations of undocumented migrants are very much in the eye of the beholder.For Trump and his populist supporters the immigration crackdowns are about arresting and deporting dangerous gang members and migrants with criminal records.\n\"I have no problem rounding up hardened gang members and the illegal aliens that associate with them and deporting them immediately. Those in our country to do harm don't deserve to be here,\" said U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, in a recent social media statement.\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing Maryland's Eastern Shore, also backs Trump's hardline approach. \"It's time to deport all criminal illegal aliens to keep our communities safe,\" Harris said in a social media statement.\nHe points to the recent murder, rape and sexual assault conviction of Victor Martinez-Hernandez, a fugitive from El Salvador, in the 2023 killing of Rachel Morin, 37, in Hartford County.\n\"Rachel Morin would be here today had it not been for the dangerous wide-open border policies of the Biden administration,\" Harris said in a statement.\nTrump's hardline immigration policies, which his backers hope include crackdowns on human trafficking, are among his most popular policies.\nA recent CBS News Poll found 58% of U.S. voters back Trump's deportation efforts, while the same percentage opposes his tariffs push.\nIn the other corner, progressive groups, including some Christian organizations, worry about expulsions of refugees and asylum seekers and arrests of undocumented immigrants who are working in the U.S.\n\"Our faith calls us to stand with children and families fleeing violence and persecution, not to turn them away. These orders place vulnerable lives in danger and foster a culture of exclusion and fear,\" said Sandy Ovalle, senior director of campaigns and mobilizing for Sojourners, a Christian social justice group.\n\"We must act in solidarity with those who are suffering and continue to advocate for policies rooted in justice, mercy, and love,\" she said.\nThe Washington D.C.-based group also worries about potential Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions impacting churches and schools.\n\"Serving migrant people is a religious liberty issue for many communities of faith. Relaxing the rules around immigration raids at sensitive locations like churches and schools makes it much more difficult for our houses of worship to serve as safe spaces for spiritual nourishment for all people, setting the stage for less safety and more trauma for everyone,\" Ovalle said.\nThe Sojourners group and Pope Francis have criticized Trump and other immigration hardliners for what they see as violations the biblical calls to welcome the stranger and to love thy neighbor.\nA recent report by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of Evangelicals, World Relief and other groups said more than 10 million of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who could be deported are Christians.\n\"Eighty percent of immigrants vulnerable to deportation identify as Christians, with 61% being Catholic and 13% identifying as evangelical Christians,\" according to the report.\nThe same study found 77% of asylum seekers are Christians and close to 7 million U.S. citizens \"live in households with someone at risk of deportation.\"\n'BAD THIN\nGS TO COME'\nKaren Hunter sees Trump's immigration raids and deportations through her church's lens.\nHunter is a priest at Grace Episcopal Church in Nampa, Idaho. Her congregation and the church's community ministries have included undocumented persons.\nShe's seen deportations during past U.S. administrations and worried about the downstream ramifications during the post-pandemic migrations under the Biden administration.\n\"When the Biden administration opened the border, I knew it was the beginning of bad things to come,\" Hunter said, pointing to stagnant working class wages, affordable housing shortages and strained schools and social services.\nThe post-pandemic surges in migrations during the Biden administration included more than 8.6 million border patrol encounters with migrants at the Mexico border and more than 5.8 million asylum applications, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\nSome of the migration surges came from conflict zones in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Other migrants, including from Haiti and Latin America, were escaping gangs, crime, religious persecution, poverty and extreme weather events such as natural disasters and droughts.\n\"I knew it would eventually result in deportations and that people who were living here peacefully and productively would end up getting caught up in deportations and an unwillingness of the general population to make ways for those who should have a way to stay,\" Hunter said.\nShe's worried about what's next under Trump, who has designated Latin American gangs and drug cartels as terrorists and has deported some alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.\n\"It is a painful thing to contemplate that some of our friends and members may face deportation,\" she said. \"I know from experience that there will not be relief for undocumented folks once they are picked up.\"\nTrump recently picked up a victory when the U.S. Supreme Court okayed his use of the 1798 wartime law the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador.\nThe Trump camp has also criticized federal judges blocking the administration's immigration crackdowns.\n\"President Trump has made it his number-one priority to secure the border, defeat the cartels, and remove criminal aliens from American communities,\" said Chad Wolf, homeland security chair for the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute.\n\"The Trump administration has rightly indicated that they will use any legal authority available to protect Americans. Unfortunately, in recent weeks, partisan judges have repeatedly attempted to usurp the lawful power of the presidency to identify and remove terrorist organizations from our streets,\" said Wolf, who served in the first Trump administration.\nThe U.S. administration has also curtailed refugee and asylum programs and is also embroiled in fights over its attempts to revoke student visas and deport foreign students it has deemed supportive of Islamic militant groups in pro-Palestinian protests against U.S. military support for Israel and the post-Oct. 7 war in Gaza.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, traveled to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The Salvadoran migrant, who lives in Maryland, was deported by the Trump administration, is being held in an El Salvador prison and there is a legal fight over bringing Garcia back to the U.S.\n\"The Trump (administration) can lie all they want, but the court said they failed to show he was part of MS-13. This is about bringing home a man they admit should've never been abducted. I won't rest until then,\" said Van Hollen, referring to the notorious Salvadoran gang and court rulings calling for Garcia to be returned to the U.S.\nTrump called Van Hollen \"a fool\" and \"grandstander\" over the visit. Harris and other Trump backers argue Democrats and progressives seem to care more gang members illegally in the U.S. than the victims of their crime, including human trafficking.\nIn Idaho, Hunter is frustrated with the situation undocumented migrants face and how they are viewed and treated by both sides.\n\"They become a kind of slaves. They have to put up with low wages and bad housing,\" she said.\n\"Even those in the media who seem to be advocating for undocumented people refer to them as the people who clean the houses and cut the grass or work in the fields. They do the work Americans won't do, they say. It's a short step from that thinking to 'they are here to serve us, to do our dirty work',\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Through these partnerships, the Judy Centers are able to provide a full range of early intervention and comprehensive services within the school and center.\"\nThe center offers multiple avenues of help and learning for Federalsburg residents ages 5 and younger.\n\"When we talk about working with those families and children, we offer play groups and our services always have a parent and a child component,\" said Heather Harding, Federalsburg Judy Center Early Learning Hub coordinator. \"It's always a family caregiver and the child together. So we offer play groups throughout the week, we offer family engagements, we offer parent training and that may take on different forms… We service the whole family so it's whatever the family determines their needs are, and it is a strength-based program.\"\nThe celebration of 25 years featured an event with activities for children and families. The Judy Center created a timeline walkthrough for the last 25 years and invited all previous employees from the 25 years to participate.\n\"It was really important for us that when we plan the celebration that we took it back to the focus of the Judy Center work, which is family,\" Elizabeth Saylor, supervisor of instruction, said.\n\"So, we did a big family event, so the kids had something fun to do, and the families had something fun to do, and then we did all those the traditional ceremonial things too…We invited all previous employees to come back as well. So, it truly was as current families, family families, but then definitely our work family as well.\"\nStaff said the impact was the best reward for all the hard work.\n\"I absolutely love my job with the Judy Center, and I was here previously, when we also worked as an Early Head Start under the direction of Ms. Tearesa French,\" Harding said. \"She was the supervisor for 22 years of it. The impact that the work has made on everyone, it was never just one person. It's always been a collective. It's always been at the helm of Caroline County Public Schools, and just all the things that we were able to do to serve children and families has just been wonderful.\"\nTo learn more about the Judy Center, visit carolineschools.org/page/early-learning. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I thought that was sad and amazing.\"\nTidwell's new book, \"The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue,\" looks beyond Takoma Park. It examines extreme weather events and climate change happening across the state. And other experts agree that the impact is vast, including on the Eastern Shore, where more dead trees can be found in the \"ghost forests\" of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\nThese things are happening because temperatures in Maryland have never been warmer.\nSince the 20th century, temperatures in the state have risen around 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. But it's more than just heat. Federal data shows the state is experiencing increasing precipitation, a higher probability of summer droughts, more extreme weather events and flooding accompanied with rising sea levels.\nThe impact of climate change on the state is as varied as its landscape. From vast forests and rolling farms that line the Eastern Shore to the 80.9 square miles of Baltimore City scattered with heat islands, different areas of the state will be affected by climate change in vastly different ways.\nTo hear Tidwell and other environmental experts tell it, the state's poorest communities will face the greatest climate challenges. Communities on the Eastern Shore — where farmlands are becoming wetlands — and Baltimore's city neighborhoods are at particular risk.\n\"There are certain communities, especially marginalized communities that won't have the resources to adapt,\" Tidwell said. \"We just have to stabilize the climate before we face those truly nightmarish impacts.\"\nThe changes Maryland is likely to face are detailed in the federal government's fifth National Climate Assessment — but the Trump administration deleted all that data from the internet on June 30. However, the Local News Network at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism downloaded all that data months ago and used it as the basis of this story and the accompanying county summaries.\nHere's a closer look at what's happening to the climate, and what's expected to happen, across the state:\nEASTERN SHOREThe remnants of Harriett Tubman's birth home sit in a dying forest in Dorchester County.\n\"They found the original foundations of her home and you now can't even get there because it's in the middle of a ghost forest,\" said Kate Tully, a researcher and associate professor at the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.\nGhost forests — which are either partially or completely dead — can be found throughout the lower Eastern Shore in Dorchester, Somerset, Worcester and Wicomico counties. These ghost forests result from saltwater intrusion, or what Tully refers to as \"invisible floods,\" where seawater creeps inland as temperatures and waters rise.\n\"That's essentially when the salt burns the tree from the inside out,\" Tully said.\nHigh tides, droughts and groundwater pumping all contribute to this increasingly common phenomenon. Eventually, land plagued by saltwater intrusion turns into either marshland or open water.\nAs a result, Tubman's home — only discovered just a few years ago in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge — is now inaccessible.\nIn the lower Eastern Shore, there are over 70,000 acres of forest classified by the state as ghost forests, with 90% of those acres classified as severely or very severely impacted. For a forest to fall under these classifications, at least half of its trees would be dead.\nBut saltwater intrusion isn't just killing forests.\n\"There are farmers that are being highly impacted by the saltwater intrusion and the loss of productivity of their land,\" said Elliott Campbell, director of the science and research division of the Watershed and Climate Services at Maryland's Department of Natural Resources.. \"There's not really a way to, like, get the salt out.\"\nFarms along the Eastern Shore, including northern counties such as Cecil, Kent, Talbot and Caroline, are known for growing corn and soybeans, used primarily to feed livestock, Campbell said. But these crops don't grow well in salty soil, and Campbell said there is no perfect alternative.\nWhile there are vulnerable farms throughout the entire shore, Tully said Black communities in the lower Eastern Shore are being disproportionately impacted by saltwater intrusion.\n\"We've already lost so many Black farms in Black communities on the Eastern Shore,\" Tully said. \"There's actually a whole history that's already gone underwater that we will never get back.\"\nIn the Antebellum period, the lower Eastern Shore became home to many free Black people escaping slavery from Virginia and other Southern states. The tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay helped provide a living for many formerly enslaved people. But Tully said these communities — and their deep-rooted history — will disappear soon if they're not already underwater.\nThe Chesapeake Bay region is the United States' third-most vulnerable area to sea level rise behind Louisiana and South Florida, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nBecause the low-lying, largely flat area is so vulnerable, the effects of an increasing climate are much more intense than in other parts of the state. The Chesapeake Bay has already risen from 1.3 to 1.5 inches each decade over the past 100 years, and increasing temperatures would drastically increase precipitation.\nThe land isn't the only thing vulnerable to climate change. Throughout the entire Eastern Shore, the fishing industry is changing.\n\"One very clear example is that we never had a shrimp industry in the state until the last couple years,\" Campbell said.\nCampbell also said blue crabs populations, which do well in warmer waters, will thrive. But the effects on the bay aren't all positive.\nWarmer waters will kill fish at an increasing rate, Campbell said. Similarly, an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the acidity in the ocean water, which can deplete oyster populations.\nAs for the Eastern Shore's farmland and ghost forests, Campbell said the best case for this land experiencing saltwater intrusion is for it to transition into wetlands. The state has a pilot program to help farmers with that transition.\n\"In some cases, you see marshes forming under those forests,\" Campbell said. \"But in some cases, they eventually will transition to just open water and you lose that ecosystem.\"\nCapital News Service reporter Rachel McCrea contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's also a distressing confirmation of the anti-democratic instincts of a man who, with his fellow court conservatives, has lately wielded his unelected power in precedent-breaking, culture-transforming ways - regarding abortion rights in particular - that would never pass muster at the polling place.That comes against a backdrop of ethics concerns that have undermined the court's credibility lately, involving justices from both sides of its deep ideological divide.The details vary: Justices Clarence Thomas has accepted luxury trips and other perks from a prominent Republican donor; Justice Neil Gorsuch made a big real estate sale to a lawyer whose firm has business before the court; Justice Sonia Sotomayor's staff has prodded public institutions to buy her memoir.The justices for the most part have responded to the mini-scandals, if at all, by denying wrongdoing and/or saying they will be more careful going forward.Alito had a different approach when ProPublica was preparing to report in June that he had accepted private jet travel to a luxury fishing trip from a politically active billionaire: He preempted the story with a defiant Wall Street Journal op-ed making the tonedeaf argument that he had saved the taxpayers travel-security expenses by accepting the private ride.He insisted he technically had no legal obligation to disclose the trip, nor to recuse himself from cases before the court in which the billionaire was involved.The latter assertions are true, and that's the problem. Unlike every other judge in America, the court's nine justices aren't bound by a mandatory set of ethics standards regarding conflicts of interest and recusal.They have long asserted that they adhere to such standards voluntarily, so there is no need to officially impose them. For an answer to that assertion, re-read the preceding paragraphs.The issue has prompted movement in Congress to impose mandatory new ethics standards on the justices. Which in turn prompted Alito's claim, in the extensive Wall Street Journal interview, that the court is effectively untouchable by anybody. (One of the two writers of the coddling opinion piece, it discloses, is an attorney with a case pending before the court. You can't make this stuff up.)At first half-blush, it might make sense - surely the high court must be utterly independent from Congress to function, right? - but that ignores the entire concept of constitutional checks and balances between the three branches of government. The whole point of that concept is that no single branch holds unfettered power of the kind Alito appears to claim.As numerous legal scholars and other critics have pointed out in response to Alito's comments, Congress already requires financial disclosure of gifts and stock transactions from the justices.Congress also determines the size of the court, its budget (including the justices' pay), the dates of its sessions and other basic structural issues.Congress similarly imposes ethics standards, budgetary control and other power over the executive branch; the president, meanwhile, can veto actions of Congress. Alito hasn't questioned these and other checks and balances between the other two branches of government. It's only his own branch, apparently, that is untouchable.It's not. Congress should be cautious about overstepping its authority regarding the court, but mandatory ethics standards of the kind that govern other judges would be constitutionally defensible and could help restore public confidence in the court.If Alito is concerned that it would threaten a creeping loss of judicial independence, he should champion a move for the court to self-impose those standards.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

It also said all 10 are on track to complete the restoration goals by 2025, which was the original target year.\nThe effort to restore the oyster populations stems from a 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, which aimed to restore the bay and its surrounding waters.\nAll 10 of the tributaries were given a target number of healthy reef acres to reach. A 2023 restoration update showed that eight tributaries had hit the target of healthy acreage, which includes pre-existing reefs and recently restored ones.\nThe Manokin River in Maryland is less than halfway complete, with 222 acres of reef restoration remaining of the target 441. Virginia's Lynnhaven River is 38 more acres away from reaching its target of 152 healthy acres.\nAllison Colden, the Maryland executive director of the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, applauded the progress and vouched for continued oyster restoration in the bay.\n\"It's critically important to build on the success of these oyster restoration projects and maintain momentum by expanding these initiatives to more tributaries in Maryland and Virginia,\" Colden said in a press release. \"Restored oyster reefs support a healthy Chesapeake Bay, numerous economic opportunities, and strengthen our resilience to climate change for communities across the Bay watershed.\"\nOyster protection has been a long-running debate at the state and local levels.\nIn March, State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) introduced SB922, a bill repealing previous requirements that prevented the Maryland Department of Natural Resources \"from taking any action to reduce or alter the boundaries of certain oyster sanctuaries.\"\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, watermen supported the bill at the time, which would allow harvesting in those oyster sanctuaries. Many conservation leaders and DNR officials, though, did not.\nAs the bill made its way through the House and Senate and was amended, there was little pushback. In May, it was signed by Gov. Wes Moore. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The 2024 event saw more than 1,000 spectators, all eager to witness the competition.\nThe eating contest didn't kick off until 5:30 p.m., but by noon the taproom floor was already crowded, karaoke was being sung in the listening room, local merchants were selling their wares at one end of the taproom and the food tent was pumping out crawfish and muskrat themed dishes.\nThe food was provided by Palm Beach Willies, a local favorite in Taylors Island. Willies chef John Butz and his team cranked out quesadillas, spring rolls, muskrat barbecue and steamed crawdads. The line for food was steady, with many of those in line looking to try the signature dish, muskrat, for the first time.\nGraffius explained, \"We started this event as an add on to the Dorchester County Outdoor Show, but over the years we have outgrown the various venues we've used for past events. Bringing this event to Cult Classic was a perfect way to continue the tradition and provide a premiere event.\"\nFlood added, \"Some of the proceeds will go to the Waterman's Association, while others will be used to support a new scholarship fund.\" The new scholarship fund was set up in the name of Ralph \"Peg Leg\" Bramble, a two time champion and hall-of-famer who was always a fixture at this event as well as the Outdoor Show. \"He did so much to keep these traditions alive — traditions that are at the heart and history of Dorchester County,\" Graffius said.\nBramble passed the baton and his crown to the 2023 and 2022 world champion, Daniel \"Chunky\" Hesson. Hesson, a 17-year-old Dorchester native, will be attending Salisbury State next fall.\nHe has been participating in the event since he was twelve and says Bramble was a mentor. Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the two of them from a past competition on the front, Hesson said, \"Ralph always watched over me during these events, since I am usually one of the youngest competitors.\"\nWhen asked about the tie-in with crawdads, Graffius explained it is linked to Cameron Parrish, Louisiana that plays host to a similar annual event, the Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival. Guests from Cameron Parish made the trek to Dorchester County this weekend for the National Outdoor Show in Church Creek to help crown Miss Outdoors and observe the muskrat skinning semi-finals.\nThe afternoon saw a steady increase in spectators. The listening room of Cult Classic transitioned into the un-official Blues Emporium of Kent Island as DC Blues legend Jimmy Cole and his Delmarva All-stars took the stage.\nThe band features a who's-who of blues music, including Ron Holloway on tenor sax, Sam Paladino on the Hammond organ, George Sheppard on drums, Bryan Smith on bass and Jimmy Stepanson on lead guitar.\nBy 5 p.m. the room was filled to capacity, and the anticipation was palpable as the nine contestants took the stage, one by one. The contestants included Hesson, as well as past competitor Mike Detmer, also of Dorchester County, and several first timers, some of whom had never had muskrat before.\nDetmer is known from past contests as \"Dirty Legs\" Detmer, due to the amount of meat he has been known to leave on the bones during the contest.\nAs he took the stage for the finale, he stripped off his camo jacket to reveal a gold sequin shirt, which turned out to be somewhat prophetic, as Detmer would go on to win the event by a tenth of a pound over Hesson.\nDetmer paid tribute to his fellow competitors, \"The rest of the competition is great — they are truly champions and I am surprised I won,\" he said.\nAs the event concluded, Detmer accepted the trophy from Flood and Graffius, amid calls for a re-test from Hesson's supporters. First-time entrant Cody Fenzel from Millersville rounded out the top three.\nGraffius is hoping to bring the event back to Cult Classic for the 2025 edition. Flood said they were \"psyched\" to be hosting this year's event.\n\"It's a perfect partnership between the weird and wonderful things we love about where we live and the crazy creativity of our neighbors,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Awards were handed out, and the event concluded with a special lunch honoring the athletes. Head coaches Freebery and 1972 Olympian Jack Brosius, assistant coaches Danielle Cudone and Anne Scott, as well as Ricky Freebery and parents, helped run the event.\nOpening ceremonies began at the Washington College boathouse with Kent paddlers. Scott Kuster played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on his baritone horn, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance from newcomer Thos Stevenson. Brian Tate recited the athletes' oath before the competitions began.\nAthletes adjusted to conditions after being unable to use the docks. Freebery, the only coach allowed on the dock, provided a recap of the racing. Competitors included McKenzie Weaver (150 meters, first season kayaking in a tandem with Cudone), Nick Gaorfal (150), Thos Stevenson (150, tandem with support staff Courtney Phelps), Woody Glenn Jr. (500, tandem with his father Woody Glenn Sr.), Chris Dooley (500), Tom Rickloff (500), Brian Tate (500), Robin Baker (500), and Scott Kuster (500).\nTeam members who did not compete this year due to schedule conflicts included Allison Bedell, Andrew Jackson, and Palmer Hopwood.\nFreebery praised the athletes' dedication despite a challenging season.\n\"I'm so proud of our team. This year had a lot of challenges; the dock broke right before our season started, so we weren't able to use the beach for many practices. Then we had so many days with heat indexes over 100 degrees or thunderstorms on the horizon that kept us off the water,\" she said.\nOn Saturday, the paddlers persevered, showing determination and teamwork.\n\"Everyone put in such great effort and was very adaptable. It was rewarding watching our new paddlers go from never having been in a kayak before to racing down the Chester,\" Freebery said.\nShe also highlighted the camaraderie among athletes.\n\"Practices are always fun, with the athletes cheering each other on, helping carry boats, and pushing one another to do their best,\" she said.\nThe team hopes to host the Maryland championships again next year and is seeking more volunteers and Special Olympics paddlers for next summer. They also launched a campaign to acquire new boats and paddles. To support their cause, visit support.somd.org/team/755145.\nBrian Tate, reflecting on the team's spirit, offered a possible motto:\n\"Teamwork makes the dream work,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A team that went undefeated in conference play this season and came in as the No. 1 seed. And a team that won its first ESIAC championship since 2019.\nBut the Sabres (10-3) were consistently beaten to the ball by the Herons (6-5-1) in the first half, and halfway through the second half.\n\"We were definitely dominant in the first half and the first 20 minutes of the second half,\" Gunston head coach Tony D'Antonio said. \"And then it was pretty even after that. They found the net and we didn't.\"\nSts. Peter & Paul found the net in the 8th minute, when Emery Zimmerman parked a direct kick into the right side of the net for a 1-0 lead.\nGunston got a pair of corner kicks in the 18th minute, the first skidding through the crease but finding no one on the other end. Sabres keeper Kaylin Palmer made a save on a direct kick with 13:30 left in the first half.\nThe Herons then put together a flurry off a corner with 5 minutes remaining before the break. A corner kick sailed over the Palmer's outstretched fingers and through the crease. Gunston kept possession, striking a ball that hit one of its own players before sending a shot over the crossbar.\nThen with 2:04 left before halftime, Ellie Roberts sent a drive from about 25 yards out that nestled into the far right corner for a 1-1 tie.\n\"It's hard to beat a team three times,\" McCall said of the Sabres' two regular-season wins over Gunston. \"But I think we were mostly in panic mode. They (Gunston) always come out really fast and we're normally a second-half team. So we were very defensive and I think that's what saved us. And then eventually we got the offense together and it all came together.\"\nSts. Peter & Paul got a huge boost just 2 seconds before halftime when Morgan got a ball and tucked it inside the left post for a 2-1 halftime lead.\n\"It was absolutely huge,\" Sabres head coach Nicole Edsall said of Morgan's goal.\nSophomore Emery Zimmerman agreed.\n\"I think that was essential because it really just got us going,\" Emery Zimmerman said. \"It (made us) realize, 'OK, we need to win this. We want to win this. This is ours. We came all this way undefeated (in conference play). This is the time that we need to come out and score.\n\"When they caught up to us and we got back up one more like right off the bat, it really got us going,\" Emery Zimmerman continued. \"Gave us a lot of enthusiasm and momentum.\"\nBut not right away.\n\"They definitely had jitters in the first half,\" Edsall said of her team. \"And when we talked at halftime I said, 'I know this isn't the team that we are. So just kind of brush it off. Let it go. Start the half over and let's play our game.'\"\nPlay evened out midway through the second half. Then with 8:42 left, McCall bent a corner that plopped right in front of Eden Zimmerman, who tapped it in for a 3-1 lead.\n\"I've been struggling on my corners all season,\" McCall said. \"I usually just boot it and hope. Eden is always everywhere and she just found it. It got the curve that it needed and she was just there for it. We've always been a team that struggles to like get it in (on corners). It's always gone right through. But she was just right there where she needed to be.\"\nLess than 2 minutes later, the Sabres spilled into the box before Kendall Kroniser gained possession, spun away from a defender and drilled in a fourth goal.\n\"I'm sure it's great for the seniors,\" Emery Zimmerman said. \"I'm happy for them. I feel over the last year nobody leaving (through graduation) and through this year, we really built up on our skills and built great team chemistry. And this is what happens when you work hard at practice.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Proven leader': Easton will soon welcome Kitzrow as new town manager\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — After nearly a year without a permanent town manager, Easton will welcome Andy Kitzrow next month.Kitzrow, the current Salisbury city administrator, was tapped by Mayor Megan Cook to assume the post from Police Chief Alan Lowrey, the interim town manager since August. Kitzrow begins July 7.\nDuring an interview in Salisbury last week, Kitzrow said he instantly noticed opportunity in Easton.\n\"The more I looked at Easton, the more I started to fall in love with where they're going,\" Kitzrow said.\nThe new town manager is Cook's most major appointment in her two years as mayor. Kitzrow will oversee town operations, lead department heads and town staff, and be a point of contact with the mayor and Town Council members.\nAfter whittling down a list of around 12 semifinalists, the town conducted full-day interviews with four finalists. It was an intensive but worthwhile process, Cook said.\nShe felt Kitzrow rose above the others, as he was up to speed on what's happening in Easton and meshed well with her and with town employees.\n\"(Staff) really thought of the candidates, he could get up and running the fastest because he had the background of Maryland politics,\" Cook said.\nKitzrow, 42, served as Wicomico County recreation superintendent before becoming Salisbury's deputy city administrator in 2017 and city administrator in 2023.\nIn Salisbury, Kitzrow worked under three different mayors, including Jake Day, now the Department of Housing and Community Development secretary. Day noted Kitzrow's oversight of city permit and procurement operations as especially impactful.\n\"It's not easy work, but he's a proven leader,\" Day said of Kitzrow. \"Somebody who can do it.\"\nCook says while the Day connection didn't factor into her decision, it will benefit Easton as the town tackles its own housing challenges and initiatives.\n\"Having that relationship, I think, is great. It's key,\" Kitzrow said. \"A lot of this is about relationships, whether they are elected officials or state officials.\"\nA BETTER FIT\nWorking under three different mayors, Kitzrow says he's experienced three very different visions.\nIn early 2023, Day left Salisbury with then-city administrator Julia Glanz to head up the state's housing and community development efforts. Jack Heath served as mayor until current Mayor Randy Taylor won an election later that year.\nDuring Day's tenure, Salisbury undertook a number of efforts to redevelop its downtown through programs providing tax incentives to developers, such as \"Here is Home\" and HORIZON — the latter aimed at bringing multifamily residential and hotel units, an initiative which Kitzrow championed.\n\"(He was) the mastermind behind the HORIZON legislation that we passed locally,\" Glanz said.\nTaylor and developers have clashed in recent months over the stalling of downtown projects, some of which were approved by former mayors and councils. In April, DelmarvaNow.com reported that developers of a downtown project filed a $40 million lawsuit against Salisbury and Taylor.\nWhile Kitzrow believes the change in vision is OK and can be solved through compromise, he acknowledges it factored into his choice to accept the Easton post. Neither Taylor nor Heath could be reached for an interview.\n\"Professionally and personally, the town that Megan wants to run and her goals align more with what I value and what I want to be part of,\" Kitzrow said.\nGOALS IN EASTON\nSalisbury's population is nearly double Easton's, but Kitzrow sees similar challenges and opportunities in the two areas.\nHe said he wants to \"move projects forward in a smart way.\" In Salisbury, he's dealt with a housing pipeline of around 5,000 units and led a focus on building \"from the inside out.\" Easton's pipeline has recently hovered around 1,000 units.\nKitzrow is hoping to bring a focus to Easton's Rails to Trails network, given his parks and recreation background, as well as get \"under the hood\" in the human resources department.\nCook said she's excited to bring on a consistent leader during what she says has been a year full of change in town. \"I'm looking forward to a steady ship ... and some calm seas ahead,\" Cook said.\nWorking for the mayor, Kitzrow emphasized that strong relationships with the Town Council will be crucial in completing the work that will make Easton a better place.\n\"We are working together, not against each other, and I think that's important,\" Kitzrow said.\nKitzrow will remain living in Salisbury with his wife and kids. He owns Escape Salisbury, a downtown escape room business.\nBut he's looking to learn as much about Easton as possible. He said he's especially excited to meet business owners, nonprofit leaders and community members in his first 60 days on the job. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It would be helpful for the Star to provide bylines for OpEds with political themes. In this case, it would show that David Reel is the former chairman of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee.This OpEd is characteristic of what I call the post 2016 American Enterprise sandwich. The American Enterprise Institute is the longtime conservative redoubt that has employed the likes of Newt Gingrich and Dinesh D'Souza.In off-year elections, the party not in the White House characteristically does very, very well. In 2016, the Republican Party let their extreme Donald Trump flag fly with disappointing results including the continuing speaker of the House fiasco and legislative stalemate because of the Republican Party's slimmest of majorities.The American Enterprise sandwich is a way for the conservative fringe to further itself with the veneer of non-combative moderation. The sandwich opens with a seemingly nonpartisan theme, in this case challenges and opportunities for Democrats and Republicans in addressing the African American electorate.The meat follows with opinion and statistics which are negative for the Democratic Party. The final section contains platitudes about listening to the electorate.Any piece dealing with how the Republican Party relates to the African American electorate that does not include the nationwide voter suppression efforts targeting that community cannot be taken seriously.In the case of David Reel's OpEd, it is not only in the style of the American Enterprise sandwich, but all the opinion is from American Enterprise staff and all the data is from American Enterprise surveys.Be on the look out for this type of opinion piece and remember that Donald Trump is overwhelmingly favored to be the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 2024. Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy, and any attempts to distract from that reality should be ignored.HOLLY WRIGHTEastonDo more, with moreQuality education is the foundation of any flourishing society. As diversity, equity and inclusion get forced into everyday life by small groups around America, what happened to education?Groups are trying to measure equity and inclusion but seem to be totally ignoring the measurement of our schools and student performance.One recent report cited 13 public schools in Baltimore with less than 5% of students passing math and reading at grade level. How are voters not horrified and ashamed?Our governor is at public events for the arts and everything else under the sun but what has been offered to measure concrete improvements to our school, teacher and student performance? Has anyone in government or the Department of Education set a performance milestone to address this total failure. How can anyone so blatantly ignore these failing grades.There are the parades and protests supporting just about any cause or whim but not for education.Just a thought: How about our governor and the Board of Education and teachers union commit that 50% of Baltimore students will pass reading and math at grade level before the next election in 2026. 50% is still embarrassingly poor but it would be a start. (70% in the other state school districts.)Do any tax paying or voting citizens think 50% is too big of a job for our leaders? Would our teachers themselves accept a failure rate of 50%? Apparently so and for years. These results were here before COVID-19, and the money has been available for many years. Look at how much has been spent per student in our Baltimore public schools compared to the much more successful schools around the country.Clearly, money in Maryland is not the problem. Do more, with more. Accountability.We need measurable commitments from Gov. Moore and the dducation department followed by results before the next election cycle. We need to stop hiding from this clear failure of our youth and present the voting public with a plan to enforce measurement results.We are anxiously waiting.RICH ADRIANEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Plea hearing is scheduled for Rider case\n\n June 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Crime \n \n 434\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Fred \"Trey\" Rider III is planning to enter a plea deal in August rather than standing trial for charges related to a fire at his home on Peach Orchard Road in Easton.At a virtual status hearing Tuesday, Judge Thomas G. Ross scheduled a plea hearing for Aug. 19, the first day of when Rider's trial was supposed to begin, and a sentencing hearing for October.\nRider is accused of setting his house on fire in November 2022.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary. According to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put more than 45 firefighters who responded in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nAt the status hearing Tuesday, Talbot County Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Wilson said Rider plans to plead guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment. She said the state plans to enter nolle prosequi for Rider's remaining nine charges, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nRider's attorney Christine DuFour, who took over from attorney Stephanie Shipley in April, said Rider's divorce proceedings with Kari Rider are happening parallel to this case. She said it would be helpful to know the outcome of the divorce before Rider is handed a sentence because the divorce will have an affect on the sentencing.\nThe sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 4, a little over a week after the final hearing in Rider's divorce process.\nWilson said the state is not opposed to Rider being handed suspended consecutive sentences for the reckless endangerment counts. DuFour said the state could seek restitution in the plea agreement, but that has not been determined.\nRider was supposed to stand trial March 4, but at a status hearing that morning, Ross said Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning. After getting discharged, Rider was granted a request to be transferred to an alcohol and drug rehab facility for 60 days, with the condition that he return to the Talbot County Detention Center upon completing the program.\nOn May 14, the detention center was ordered to release Rider on a previously posted $20,000 unsecured bond. Rider was released on conditions including that he surrender his passport, he reside in a sober living home in Pasadena, he attend Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and he enroll in mental health services.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to clarify the state's opinion on Rider potentially receiving suspended consecutive sentences. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton planners: amid affordable housing shortage, inclusionary zoning may be useful\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1134\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Through her work at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Daisy Aguilar interacts with many prospective first-time homebuyers. Of the many challenges they face, housing prices in Easton and Talbot County are at the top of the list.\"The houses, they're not affordable right now,\" Aguilar, the center's housing coordinator, said. \"And most people that are buying, they're buying in Dorchester County because it's more affordable than it is in Talbot County.\"\nAn inclusionary zoning ordinance in the works could pave the way for more affordable homeownership and rental opportunities in Easton. It would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable, defined separately for ownership and rental.\nInclusionary units in ownership developments would need to meet an affordable price for households making up to 100% of area median income, while rental developments would need to meet prices affordable for households making up to 60% of area median income.\nAccording to Jim Bent, chair of the Affordable Housing Board, Easton's area median income was around $98,000 last year.\nWhile similar legislation has faced hurdles in the past, town leaders and affordable housing proponents are hopeful the time is now for inclusionary zoning to be implemented.\nEASTON'S WORKFORCEEaston Mayor Megan Cook is well aware of the fact many can't afford to live in town, including essential workers, town employees and police officers.\n\"When you're sworn to protect and serve a community, yet you can't even live in the community that you're dedicating your life to, that says something,\" Cook said. \"That's not quite the message we should be sending people.\"\nAccording to the draft ordinance, Census data shows that 42% of around 17,000 Talbot County workers commute into the county. Cook and others are hoping the ordinance can lower that percentage.\n\"A lot of the people who work in those fields earn wages where they have been priced out of the Easton market, and so their only option is to find housing in adjacent counties,\" said Miguel Salinas, Easton's director of planning and zoning.\nFor homebuyers, the local market is a significant challenge. According to the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors, the average home price in Talbot County in 2024 was $856,000.\nTown staff's calculation of the maximum affordable home price for a family of four making the area median income is $292,000.\n\"There was a time, a couple years, not too long ago, that houses were affordable,\" Aguilar said. \"I mean, they were selling fast, but they were affordable. And at least you had the possibility of actually getting a house.\"\nTHE ORDINANCESalinas, who has led the town's efforts to create the ordinance, recognizes it is just one piece of the puzzle. But it's a critical step, he said.\n\"This is one tool in the toolbox. And it's been discussed for 20-plus years,\" Salinas said.\nSince it was initially presented in February 2023, Salinas said the ordinance has endured many revisions, along with being viewed by the town's Affordable Housing Board, Attainable Housing Task Force and an outside contractor.\nTown planners looked at similar provisions in jurisdictions such as Queen Anne's County, Annapolis and Frederick when drafting the ordinance.\nA draft version of the inclusionary housing ordinance was passed 4-1 by the town's Planning Commission last November.\nPlanning Commission member Michael Ports, speaking for himself and not the commission, said the inclusionary zoning ordinance would do two things particularly well. It would push the \"cost burden predominantly away from existing residents\" and incentivize developers to build inclusionary units.\nIn addition to the requirement that 15% of units fit the inclusionary definitions, the ordinance would grant developers that provide inclusionary units on the same site as market-rate units with a 20% density bonus.\nSuch aspects of the ordinance encourage mixed-income projects, which town leaders believe can help to reduce housing inequities.\n\"Housing segregation opens the door to other types of segregation, and you can certainly see that in many, many communities,\" Salinas said. \"But not just racial and ethnic, but also age.\"\nTom Klein, the Planning Commission's sole vote against the ordinance, says he is a proponent of more affordable and workforce housing. He believes inclusionary zoning is not \"necessary nor a cost-effective way\" to achieve that goal.\n\"For the past two years that I have been on the Planning Commission, just about every new development proposal has come with a component of affordable/workforce housing,\" Klein wrote in an email.\nRecent developments that provide the town with affordable housing include projects from The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, such as Port Street Commons, a multi-use property with nine affordable apartment units that opened in December, and Silo Square, a mixed-income housing project greenlit in October.\nRevitalization of the Doverbrook Apartments complex in Easton is underway and will feature an additional 14 affordable units on top of 50 existing ones. On Elliott Road, more than 100 apartments are under construction, a portion of those affordable.\nLast July, the town approved the annexation of 17 acres of land for a housing project on the east side of Route 50. In the annexation agreement, developers agreed at least 50% of the project's apartment units will be affordable.\nGiven the number of ongoing projects, Klein says he feels inclusionary zoning would not \"provide a significant number\" of additional affordable units.\nBut Ports believes the ordinance will ensure that the limited supply of undeveloped land in the town is being used properly.\n\"It's really the biggest asset any community has,\" Ports said. \"If we want to allow someone to potentially change it forever, we need to make sure that they're investing in the community in some way.\"\nREGULATIONAt the November Planning Commission meeting, Klein and other commission members expressed concerns of overregulation prior to voting on the ordinance.\n\"I think that the market's taking care of it,\" Klein said. \"I think that we're putting a lot of regulation here. Like I said, I think there could be a lot of unintended consequences that come out of that and a lot of cost for what we get out of it.\"\nSalinas and Bent both said the market hasn't been able to address ballooning home and rental costs in recent years.\nBent said he's heard from planning commissioners in the past that a \"tool\" is needed to point developers toward what the town wants in terms of affordability.\nWhile proponents of inclusionary zoning are confident it can be this tool, they recognize the housing problem in Easton is complex.\n\"If we got into this hole of housing deficiency over the course of decades, it's impossible to fix that in one year, let alone even 10 years,\" Ports said. \"It will be a game of playing catch-up.\"\nCook hopes Easton residents, along with the Town Council, see affordable housing as a top challenge to tackle.\n\"I do hope that they see the importance of this issue, and I also hope that the community itself sees the importance of the issue,\" Cook said. \"For the longevity and the vibrancy of the Town of Easton, it's an important issue.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bodman, who is charged with manslaughter, distribution and possession with the intent to distribute narcotics, distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl or heroin, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, reckless endangerment and conspiracy.Police also announced that Elina Lazarieva, 23, of Easton was arrested in Baltimore on Aug. 2 on similar charges.The charges stem from the duo's alleged involvement in an overdose death in Easton.Easton officers were dispatched to the 100 block of Prospect Avenue on Sept. 5, 2022, for an unresponsive man.Talbot County paramedics also responded and pronounced the man, identified as 28-year-old Cristian Gonzales, dead.Easton police's criminal investigation division initiated an investigation, learning that Lazarieva had met with Bodman for the purpose of obtaining controlled dangerous substances.Police said Lazarieva contacted Bodman and the two traveled to Delaware to obtain heroin.After obtaining the heroin, the two traveled back to Easton and delivered the drug to Gonzales, who later overdosed, police said.Both Bodman and Lazarieva were turned over to the Talbot County Detention Center following their arrests.Lazarieva was released on bond Sept. 12, according to online court records. Her case is scheduled for a jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court in early January. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Opioid deaths spur push for kids to carry naloxone\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Jackson Taylor remembers when a peer passed out from an overdose across from his high school. He knows friends who have struggled with addiction. One has been in and out of rehab.Those experiences help explain why the Rockville High School senior now trains his peers on how to administer naloxone, a lifesaving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. They're why he carries naloxone at school and why he wants all districts to let their students do the same.\n\"It's just like a student having a heart attack,\" said Taylor, who runs a student task force on drug and opioid issues in Montgomery County. \"It might be rare, but on the off chance it happens, you want to be able to save them and help them.\"\nCurrently, a disparate and ambiguous set of district-level policies has created confusion on the role students may play in preventing opioid deaths among their peers. But a bill before the Maryland General Assembly aims to provide a clear and uniform set of standards.\nThe measure, HB 1268, would explicitly authorize students across the state to possess and administer naloxone — also known by its brand name, Narcan — as adolescent opioid deaths surge and teens lobby for urgent solutions.\nWhile the practice is already permitted for students in Montgomery County, others have gotten punished for carrying naloxone in school, according to the bill's sponsor, Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery).\n\"We know that our student populations are uniquely vulnerable when it comes to (the opioid) issue,\" Vogel said. \"And this (bill) is, to me, a common-sense step to say, 'Hey, you should not be punished for carrying naloxone with you in a school hallway, and you should not be punished for saving a classmate's life if they're overdosing.'\"\nAt a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, Taylor, 18, was among those who testified in support of the measure. So, too, did Maryland's Special Secretary of Opioid Response, Emily Keller, an indication that the bill has the backing of Gov. Wes Moore's administration.\n\"Empowering people and giving them the tools necessary to help is a vital strategy, especially with young people,\" Keller said in her testimony. \"Making naloxone accessible with every Marylander is one of our priorities because we know it's the number one life-saving tool.\"\nThe bill responds to an alarming national trend: Between 2018 and 2022, adolescent deaths from opioids quadrupled, according to an analysis by KFF.\nThe rise in overdoses has coincided with two factors, said Patricia Kapunan, the medical director for Montgomery County Public Schools. One is the use of social media to market pills without a prescription. The other is the rise of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that is being mixed with illegal drugs, often unbeknownst to the user and with deadly effects.\nIn 2021, fentanyl was involved in nearly four times as many fatal overdoses among young people in Maryland as the next deadliest drug, cocaine, according to the state's Vital Statistics Administration.\n\"Suddenly, (fentanyl) is showing up everywhere, and suddenly one pill can kill,\" Kapunan said.\nImplementation questionsIn response to the opioid crisis, lawmakers have mandated that school districts take preventive actions. The Start Talking Maryland Act of 2017 required public schools to teach kids about the dangers of opioids and have naloxone available on campuses. It also authorized nurses and other health and school personnel to administer the medication in overdose emergencies.\nMost districts have not extended the same permission to students. In Cecil County, students are not necessarily punished for possessing naloxone, according to director of student and school safety John Roush. But \"they would be talked to by their school administration about it and informed that we don't have a policy for (them) to carry that in schools,\" he said.\nRoush thinks the bill is a good idea and may help save lives, though he anticipates challenges with implementation and logistics.\n\"We have over 15,000 kids in our system here,\" he said. \"How do you get Narcan out? How do you get information out? How do you make them educated on the use? How do you make them aware? It seems like there would be a lot of time and details to be worked out in that regard.\"\nWhile the bill requires schools to educate students about the benefits of naloxone, it does not specifically address one major logistical consideration: training kids on how to dispense the medication.\nAvailable over the counter as a nasal spray, Narcan must be administered by tilting the person's head back and firmly pressing the plunger. Because the medication's effects are temporary and overdose symptoms may return, it is critical that the individual providing Narcan also call 911 and seek medical aid.\nTo the American Medical Association, the benefits of expanding naloxone access in schools still outweigh the risks. Following a debate on the issue, the group approved a resolution last year encouraging \"states, communities and educational settings to remove barriers to students carrying safe and effective overdose reversal medications.\"\n\"Narcan saves people quickly, and lack of Narcan kills people quickly,\" said Kenneth Certa, an AMA delegate from the American Psychiatric Association, which co-sponsored the policy. \"When somebody is turning blue and cold, you don't have much time. And to wait until a dose gets from another part of the building can be too late.\"\n'Hugely empowering'In Montgomery County, which saw a 78% spike in youth overdoses from 2021 to 2022, a policy permitting students to carry naloxone took effect on May 1, 2023.\nKapunan, who crafted the measure, said students were never punished for possessing overdose-reversing medications and were already protected under good samaritan laws if they acted in an emergency. But teen advocates nonetheless pressed for a policy change that eliminated ambiguity and codified their right to intervene.\n\"Those levels of permission were really important to students,\" Kapunan said. \"For me, it was a very small part of the regulation. For them, it was hugely empowering.\"\nKapunan says the policy does not mean schools are depending on kids to save lives. During the 2022-23 school year, naloxone was dispensed on school grounds in Montgomery County 18 times, almost always by nurses. Since the policy change, there have been no known instances of a student administering naloxone to a peer at school.\nBut to supporters, the measure remains an important preventive step, permitting those in closest proximity to an overdose to act without fear of repercussion.\n\"Students know before the teachers do, is the truth,\" Taylor said. \"I'm a lot more likely to know, 'Hey, my friend has a pill in his bag that he's thinking about taking, and it could have a repercussion' than a teacher would know.\"\nVogel, who is running for the open U.S. congressional seat in Maryland's 6th District, said expanding policies like the one in Montgomery County has become a necessity. Six months ago, he met with student leaders who spoke to the urgency of the opioid crisis and their desire to help address it.\n\"A lot of them have taken matters into their own hands,\" Vogel said. \"A number of them have stepped up and said, 'We want to get trained on how to administer naloxone, and we want to be able to carry naloxone.' … That's what this bill is in response to.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And we intend to keep it here.\"\nLast occurring in 2019, the Fair Hill Races are a longstanding Cecil County tradition stretching back nearly 90 years, and their absence has been a subject of public inquiry throughout the six-year gap. With the Maryland 5 Star becoming an annual event at Fair Hill's race track, officials said that the return of the races will usher in a new era for Cecil County's equine community.\n\"A renaissance of racing starts today,\" said Del. Kevin Hornberger, who has been heavily involved in legislating the Fair Hill Special Event Zone and its use.\nThe official announcement of the races' return comes in the wake of a $2.85 million dollar partnership between Cecil County and the Sport and Entertainment Corporation of Maryland that was approved by the county council last October.\nState officials thanked local and state partners and acknowledged the feedback from Cecil Countians as a major impetus for the return of racing to the track.\n\"This is clearly a place Cecil County loves,\" Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said. \"Our responsibility as the steward is to reflect what Cecil County wants and what Cecil County needs.\"\nOther officials agreed with Kurtz, saying that Cecil Countians' calls for the return of the races have been heard.\n\"We couldn't let another year go by without racing at Fair Hill,\" said Sport & Entertainment Corporation of Maryland President Terry Hasseltine, noting that the races' return has been \"a long time coming.\"\nThis year's race will be free to the public and is planned to be a one-day event held on Aug. 30. According to Hasseltine, the number of races in this year's event is still being determined.\nWhile the reborn Fair Hill Races are the only event on the docket for the remainder of 2025, Hasseltine also said that there are already plans to hold another racing event next Memorial Day, as well as discussions about races on other dates.\n\"[Fair Hill] is globally significant when it comes to the equine community,\" said Kurtz.\nOfficials noted that the horse racing industry and economy has a multi-billion dollar impact on Maryland, directly employing approximately 22,000 workers throughout the state.\nLocal organizations expressed their pleasure that the races will finally be making their return to Cecil County.\n\"The Board of Directors is delighted by this morning's news from Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz that racing will return to Fair Hill on August 30,\" Fair Hill Foundation President Charles C. Fenwick Jr. said. \"It has been gratifying to work with his dedicated team, the Sport and Entertainment Corporation of Maryland, the Cecil County Breeders Fair, and Delegate Kevin Hornberger to make this long-anticipated outcome a reality, and we are immensely grateful for all the hard work on the part of so many people. We look forward to our continued work together to realize Mr. du Pont's vision for Fair Hill as one of the world's leading venues for equestrian sport.\"\nWith events like the Maryland 5 Star and the Cecil County Fair already making use of the site, Streight noted that his administration expects that the addition of the races and future events will show returns not only economically — with an emphasis on the benefits to small businesses — but culturally.\n\"We expect an economic boom,\" Streight said. \"[And also] a return to pride in what Cecil County has to offer.\"\nStreight also pointed to the history of the races and their value to Cecil County's identity.\n\"This is a tradition that goes back decades,\" said Streight. \"That bonded us together.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Department of Agriculture working to address ongoing DAF issues\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — The Maryland Department of Agriculture is doing \"everything within its powers\" to address recent concerns with the storage of dissolved air flotation residuals, according to Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks.Speaking to the Eastern Shore Delegation Friday morning, Atticks touched on the agency's efforts to handle the growing worries with responsible handling and storage of the sludge — an issue that has garnered extensive attention in Caroline County over the last few months.\nDissolved air flotation, or DAF, is a method used to process wastewater from food processing plants. The method leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals.\nOn the Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge.\nWhen used, managed, stored and transported correctly, there are no issues with DAF, Atticks said. But when it's used against MDA's regulations, issues arise with the smell, making neighboring residents concerned.\n\"What we're learning, what we're all collectively learning, is that for better or worse, one or two bad actors can ruin the entire setup,\" he said.\nAtticks said the agency is working on legislation to answer the concerns, but it's also doubling down on enforcement within its powers. The department is working with the Maryland Department of the Environment as well.\nOn Feb. 5, several state lawmakers introduced legislation aiming to establish an industrial sludge utilization permit. The legislation would authorize MDE to issue the permits, develop a fee schedule and inspect and enter any site where industrial sludge is utilized.\nAccording to the bill, industrial sludge includes material separated from liquid waste through a DAF process.\n\"We've been cooperating with Caroline County and in other parts of the state … to make sure that we're leaving avenues open for this product to be used responsibly and appropriately —where appropriate, when appropriate — but then putting the guardrails on it so that it's not going to cause the problems that it's causing in these minor incidents,\" Atticks said.\nDel. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil and Caroline) asked if the Department of Agriculture would look at processes that could turn DAF residuals into energy.\nAtticks said the department is actively exploring the idea.\n\"The poultry producers and other manufacturers who have food residual waste need a place to go, and it's not the landfill, and it's not the rivers,\" he said. \"If it's through this DAF process, that's an option, if it's through a bioenergy generator, even better.\"\nArentz said he'd prefer internal work to solve the problems as opposed to more regulations — a statement the secretary agreed with in part.\n\"The last thing we want is more regulation. We certainly don't mind better regulation,\" Atticks said, adding, \"We have limitations to what we can do and what we can't do, and this is an instance where we have industry come to us to say, 'We need more regulation to ensure that we can do what we're doing responsibly better,' and we can make sure that those who are bad actors are out of the business.\"\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil and Caroline) emphasized that the application of DAF isn't an issue due to the department's nutrient management plans. The unregulated storage is the problem, he said.\nA former Caroline County Commissioner, Ghrist introduced a bill Friday that would give local governments that own or operate a water or sewer system the authority to enact local legislation relating to DAF storage that is equal to or greater than the state permit requirements for sewage sludge utilization.\nTo Atticks, the goal is to get something \"on the ground\" as fast as possible, whether it's to the counties or state agencies.\n\"...More is not better here, but clearer would help — figuring out a process so that we've actually got the controls that the community feels we should have, and that our industry feels that we should have,\" he said. \"We're doing everything we can to work with the industry on this.\"\nA separate bill involving fines and fees with MDA's programs did have support from the industry, Atticks said, because those who aren't doing anything wrong don't face fines.\n\"This is one of those instances where what we need is clarity, what we need is to run the groove to make sure that we've got the authorities that we need, that MDE has the authority that they need and (that) the counties have the authority they need.\"\nStar Democrat reporter Connie Connolly contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

By a unanimous vote, town councilmembers approved a resolution for the stop signs.\nCurrently, at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Harrison Street, vehicles driving on Harrison Street do not stop, while vehicles traveling on Brookletts do.\nVan Emburgh's recommendation indicated that Easton's crash data dashboard showed five crash incidents at the intersection occurring between 2018 and 2023. Three were \"property damage incidents\" and two were \"injury incidents.\"\nAt Brookletts Avenue and Hanson Street, stop signs halt drivers on Hanson Street but not Brookletts Avenue. According to crash data, between 2018 and 2023, there was one crash incident involving five people at the intersection.\n\"I know that we've had multiple conversations and emails and stuff about some of the complaints of traffic and stuff on Brookletts,\" Interim Town Manager Alan Lowrey said Tuesday. \"And this is an opportunity to try to address that to see if implementing these four-way stops will improve some of that accident data and speed concerns.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So if you wanted to go to a family-friendly happy, fun celebration out in your community, that's what this is.\" This year, even the buttons for participants are free. Kilmon said that while the collectable buttons have been something for purchase in the past, they are free of charge this year.\n\"A lot of people collect them, and this is the 30th-year button,\" Kilmon said.\nThe buttons are available at the Easton Visitor Center on Harrison Street. They can be picked up the day of the event or anytime before that. The center is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.\nThis year will be Improv Easton's first time performing at First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said that aside from the crab drop, Improv Easton is a can't miss experience.\n\"They have been practicing and practicing and practicing for months,\" Kilmon said. \"I think that's going to be a great show.\" Kilmon said there will also be more arts and crafts activities for children at the Waterfowl Building this year.\nAnd although this is not Mike Elzey's first rodeo at First Night Talbot, this will be his first year at the Town Hall venue.\n\"It's kind of like a private concert venue versus being out in the open,\" Kilmon said of the change.\nFrom 6 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. at Town Hall, there will be a student showcase from Mike Elzey's Guitar Studio students. From 9:15 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Elzey will host an air guitar competition with prizes.\nAlong with the Waterfowl Building and Town Hall, there will also be performances at the Avalon Theater throughout the night.\nBut the main event of the night is the crab drop - an 8-foot-wide Maryland blue crab sculpture created by Rich and Suzanne Hood 19 years ago - that will drop at 9 p.m. and at midnight.\nFirst Night Talbot Program Chair Carolyn Jaffe said that when the crab reaches the bottom of the rig, it lights up the numbers for the new year.\n\"It's just the greatest,\" Jaffe said. \"Everybody loves it - to take pictures of each other in front of the crab drop when it's lit up like that.\" This year, USA Today ranked First Night Talbot's crab drop the 6th best New Year's Eve drop in the nation.\n\"They actually had the New York City drop included in that,\" Jaffe said. \"But they weren't in the top 10.\" At an Easton Town Council meeting Monday, Jaffe was honored for her many years of contributions to First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said making the entire First Night Talbot event free gives everyone the opportunity to enjoy the event.\n\"All the stuff that's happening is going to be no charge to the families,\" she said. \"We certainly just want them to come out and enjoy their community.\" More information on First Night Talbot can be found on Facebook@FirstNightTalbot Inc. on on Discover Easton's website.\nQuestions can also be directed to the Easton EDC at 410-690-7348 or welcome@discovereaston.com. \n \n Memo: FIRST NIGHT TALBOT SCHEDULE\n\n Waterfowl building, 40 S.

Resource officers already serving the school district fall under the direction and budget of the county sheriff's office.\nThe statewide grant funding assists in supplementing law enforcement coverage for public schools with $10 to 15 million in FY26 and $20 million in FY27 and each year thereafter, he said.\nAs school security is considered a top state priority, a minimum three years of funding following this year is secured, according to Saboury.\n\"So really that's putting additional eyes and ears in our schools, which is a wonderful thing,\" he said.\nAs a member of the district, the SSE works more closely with school leaders on safety measures, often outside law enforcement scopes, and are more closely involved with student behavior, support and providing intervention to mitigate and prevent harm, he said.\nAs district employees, QACPS has the flexibility to utilize SSEs for after school sporting events or field trips Saboury said.\n\"It's a great resource that the school district has never had before,\" he said.\nSSEs are held to the same standards and certification programs through the Maryland for School Safety Model training as SROs.\nTraining, uniforms, equipment and overtime are all budgeted into the grant with no cost the district, he said.\nWith the potential for increased funding down the road, Saboury was hopeful to be able to build the program and continually create a safe learning environment for students. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Why are you running for Greensboro Town Council?\nTrust me, this was not planned or even an aspiration of mine however, once I started seeing my responsibilities as a homeowner becoming more costly with nothing changing for the better, I began attending town council meetings. I found like minded people asking the same questions.The more I showed up and listened, I realized that we've been going around in circles, with no improvement in sight. I finally decided to be a part of the change that I'd like to see.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nTo ensure that the most qualified people are employed by our town and ensure they have what they need to be productive and successful. To call for accountability of rental landlords and property owners on the upkeep and condition of their properties. If anyone needs help, we guide them to the resources they need. Sending out fines to already struggling families only causes hard feelings and more trust issues. Create and maintain safe neighborhoods by working with & alongside the Greensboro Police Department.\n3. Transparency with the residents has been questioned by Greensboro residents. How would you plan to be transparent with the residents?\nThrough honesty and respect, by allowing the community to have a voice in decisions that directly affect them. I would like to create a monthly/quarterly newsletter (put together by volunteers) that would include a calendar of events, our meeting dates/times, church services and our food pantry schedule.\n4. Multiple solar projects have been proposed for Caroline County. What rules should Greensboro have in place for these projects?\nUnfortunately you are asking this question a few months too late. I petitioned the courts along with 2 other residents to block Halo from being able to move into our town but because those that came before us and not looking ahead, we lost. We will need to look outside of the box and stay up on the local and state happenings so that we can stay ahead of the curve. Thinking that \"it won't happen here\" has not done our town much good. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The ancillary building is under renovation, and the wooden device was put in before locks were installed on the new door.She posted a picture on social media on Wednesday seeking information on the bifurcated conundrum of source of donation and original use.Unravelling riddles is not the only mission underway at RLM - the building the device was deposited in is in the final stages of renovation.Ferguson said the building has had many purposes over the years, but probably not for the storage of a carriage. The building, damaged in a 2020 storm, saw the renovation begin in 2021.The building was a notion shop at one point, and it was moved to its current location on Backtown Road from Trappe's Main Street around 1900.It also served as housing for migrant workers, who slept in the loft, and was also used as an office and possibly a garage for the canning facility previously located on what is now the museum grounds.Anyone with information on what the device is or where it came from is asked to email rurallifemuseum@gmail.com or call 410-476-4857.More information about the Rural Life Museum is available online at trapperurallifemuseum.org. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRenovation on the Rural Life Museum's Carriage House is nearing completion.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRural Life Museum Board of Directors President Elizabeth Ferguson dusts off the lastest donation to the organization's collection\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe source and original use for this wooden implement remains unknown.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe mystery device's arm raises and lowers to drop a wooden peg into a metal reinforced hole.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe Rural Life Museum is located at 29241 Backtown Road in Trappe. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It has solicited the help of the owner and operator of Garden Design of Easton.Along with a beautification plan, signers of the submitted petition also requested an understanding of the costs associated with the project, an understanding of where on the list of town priorities it is and what could be done to accelerate the project, and the time table for the project.If the resources to create this plan and obtain quotes are unavailable, the petition requests a that a committee of \"concerned citizens\" be formed to create the plan and get quotes for it.In a letter submitted along with the petition, Papson said he had talked with Oxford's Wastewater Superintendent Matt Ozman to address some of Ozman's concerns.At the meeting, Ozman said his largest concern is the water main the comes off of the water tower and sends water to residences.\"That is smack dab in the center of that grass strip,\" Ozman said.\"And that's the reasoning behind not wanting deeply-rooted plants.\" Ozman said that trees, which have deep roots, could wrap around a waterline. He said anything with a shallow root system that could be replaced would be best.Costigan added that there could also be security issues depending on the height of the plants.\"We don't want to essentially block off view (from) inside,\" he said.\"Not that I'm suggesting we're a major terrorism target here, but you never know.\" Ornamental grasses and bayberries were discussed at the meeting as possibilities for the long strip in front of the fence.In an interview Thursday, Papson said that Oxford does a \"wonderful job\" of beautifying public spaces and this is another area that should be beautified. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nNick Papson submitted a petition to Oxford to \"accelerate a beautification campaign\" along the fence surrounding the water treatment facility on Jl Thompson Drive. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You open the game and score, that's OK because there's a lot of ballgame left. But when you open the second half (and score). ... And I thought it was big that we scored right before halftime and then we got the possession again. So that gives us the two-score lead. That's huge. Huge.\"\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Cambridge-SD senior quarterback Anthony Hughes scored on runs of 20 and 55 yards to help stake the Vikings to a 14-0 lead with 9 minutes, 18 seconds left in the second quarter. Collin Bair drilled both point-after kicks.\nThe Knights (0-2) rallied though. Jonathan Ferguson scored on a 1-yard run up the middle, but the point-after boot sailed wide left, leaving Century trailing 14-6.\nCambridge-SD drove from its 40 to the Knights' 20, where Dylan Vroom intercepted Vikings backup quarterback Nathan Twilley and raced 80 yards up the sideline for a touchdown. Ferguson's two-point conversion run tied the game at 14-all with 3:02 left before halftime.\nThe Vikings came right back, as Hughes lofted a pass toward the end zone that Perkins made a nice over-the-shoulder grab on for a 14-yard touchdown and a 20-14 lead with 7.6 remaining in the first half. Cambridge-SD bobbled the snap from center on the extra-point attempt, and settled for a six-point lead entering the break.\nThe Vikings needed just three plays to expand that lead on the first possession of the second half. Perkins ran for gains of 17 and 27 yards before he took a handoff and made a quick juke into the end zone for a 3-yard touchdown. Hughes hit Antonio Blueford with a two-point conversion pass for a 28-14 lead just 42 seconds into the third.\nOn its next possession, Century tried to convert a fourth-and-four from its own 31. But quarterback Jacob Dexter fired incomplete, turning the ball over to the Vikings. On the next play, William Jackson swept right and blazed into the end zone for a 31-yard touchdown. Bair added the PAT for a 35-14 lead with 9:08 to go in the third.\nCentury pulled within 35-21 with 4:50 left in the third, as Ferguson bulled his way into the end zone from 2 yards out, then booted the point-after.\nThe Knights though could not stop Cambridge-SD's big plays.\nOn its ensuing possession, Hughes broke free for his third touchdown run, this one covering 42 yards for a 41-21 cushion with 3:34 left in the third.\nCambridge-SD again stopped the Knights on fourth down, but penalties from the Vikings back to their own 6-yard line. It didn't matter, as Perkins took a handoff, found a seam up the middle, and bolted 94 yards for a touchdown. Blueford made a diving grab on Hughes' two-point pass for a 49-21 lead.\n\"We're going to get better,\" Burnham said. \"The things we struggled with today we'll make improvements on.

Anthony Lenzi, lead detective, for conducting the initial three-month-long investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect — Harold Joseph Lahr, of the 1400 block of Perryville Road — and for the continuing probe during the past two and a half months, which resulted in the identification of the six additional victims and six other states. Lenzi reportedly was assisted by fellow officers while serving as the lead investigator.\n\"These types of investigations are especially complex due to the involvement of multiple financial institutions and jurisdictions,\" Nitz commented. \"This case highlights that crime knows no boundaries. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and persistence shown by our officers in bringing justice to the victim. The Perryville Police Department remains committed to protecting our community and (to) working with partners across the country to hold criminals accountable.\"\nThe local investigation leading to Lahr's arrest and the criminal charges against him started in May, when detectives with the Orange County (Cal.) Sheriff's Office contacted the Perryville Police Department regarding an elderly resident in their jurisdiction who had been defrauded by someone in Cecil County, police reported.\nThat spurred a three-month-long investigation, culminating in the arrest of Lahr on July 30 and the charges against him, according to Nitz, who declined to specify the ruse that Lahr allegedly had used to steal the woman's money, citing the pending trial.\nNitz reported that the woman used cashier checks to pay Lahr and, on one occasion, overnighted $8,000 in cash to Lahr through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\"The investigation revealed that the victim had been defrauded of approximately $163,000 through a series of financial transactions. Through search and seizure warrants, subpoenas, and multiple interviews, Harold Lahr was identified as the suspect,\" Nitz explained.\nThe police chief further outlined, \"Investigators gathered transaction logs, video surveillance footage, and other supporting evidence before submitting the case to the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office for review.\"\nInvestigators arrested Lahr after the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office filed 11 charges against him on July 16 by way of a criminal information document, Nitz outlined.\nThe criminal charges against Lahr include four counts each of exploitation of a vulnerable adult to steal more than $25,000 and less than $100,000 and theft of more than $25,000 and less than $100,000, according to Cecil County Circuit Court records. Theft scheme to steal more than $100,000 also is among the charges against Lahr, court records show.\nLahr remained in custody on no bond Wednesday, according to court records, which further show that, on Sept. 5, Lahr was found to be incompetent to stand trial. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She brings them back to life,\" Lewis said. \"They start singing, they start dancing, they remember all the words to each one of the songs. It's wonderful to see how she can interact. It's almost like a different way of communicating.\"\nAccording to Northwestern University, musical intervention has therapeutic benefits for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease and has been proven to decrease a patient's agitation and improve communication.\nMegan Pinder, director of sales and marketing for HeartFields Assisting Living, said HeartFields had begun partnering with the Chesapeake Center about two years ago. The volunteer-led programs began with a bird club where volunteers come to the Heartfields and fill up the 41 bird feeders every week for the residents to enjoy.\nThen TiShawna, an active volunteer at the Chesapeake Center, began to come and play music for residents at HeartFields.\nAccording to Pinder, the first holiday concert was a resounding success, and TiShawna Jordan was presented with roses by the HeartFields Resident Ambassador because her playing had moved many attendees to tears.\nElsie Jordan, mother of TiShawna Jordan, said her daughter was always musically inclined. As a child she would play the keyboard, and Elsie Jordan said she would help her daughter learn new music through humming songs.\nDuring the concert, Elsie Jordan sat next to her daughter humming and singing along to classic Christmas songs such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" At some points they would both sing, encouraging the crowd of attendees to raise their voices and fully enjoy the memory of the holidays.\n\"God gave her that gift, and I want her to share her gift with other people,\" Elsie Jordan said. \"Because if it wasn't for God, she wouldn't have the gift she has. I feel like it's a gift and you shouldn't have to be paid for something you love doing. And she loves playing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Our area was devastated by the storm. Basic infrastructure services as of today, March 18, will still take based on estimates five months to one year to complete. Many are still homeless and struggling day to day.We are a small all volunteer fire department in western North Carolina. Limited budget resources handicap our ability to afford specialized equipment like all-terrain side-by-side vehicles.\nWithin 48 hours of making contact with Frank, a side-by-side vehicle was delivered to our station by Frank himself. Immediately we were able to access areas for rescue operations and ferry personnel and equipment to badly damaged locations. In some cases we had to build, cut and clear nonexistent roads and old logging roads. It took over five days to cut a path on existing roads just to get a side by side vehicle through.\nDozens of residents were transported for medical care using the machine Frank delivered to us.\nIt is the support and rapid response shown by Frank and Disaster Aid USA that gives hope and shores up faith in the greatness of the people of the United States of America.\nDAN BUCHANAN\nGreen Mountain, N.C. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'd love to see her shot percentage from today. She was amazing. They all were. They played really hard. They executed correctly. They deserved to win.\"\nAnd yet for the third time this season, this rivalry was shaping up to be a duel to the end. Sts. Peter & Paul (12-9), which came in on an eight-game winning streak, broke a 9-9 first-quarter tie when Kaylin Palmer (nine points) hit a bucket and Avery McCall converted one of two from the foul line for a three-point lead after one complete.\nBut the Royals (16-4) began connecting from beyond the arc in the second quarter. Marinelli, who drained four 3-pointers as part of a game-high 20-point performance, freshman Avery McCoy (nine points) and Layni Dukes (11 points) each hit 3-pointers, with Dukes' tying the game at 19-all with 1:31 left in the half.\nLucy Rankin kept the Sabres close, scoring six of her 12 points in the second quarter. A pair of Marinelli free throws and a Dukes layup moved Delmarva Christian to a 23-19 lead before Sts. Peter & Paul's Annie Albright scored to make it a two-point margin at the half.\nThe Royals began to widen their lead early in the third, as Marinelli buried a 3-pointer and Eve Bohinski (10 points) made a three-point play for a 29-21 lead. Emma Hainey's two free throws halted Delmarva Christian's mini-burst.\nAnd though Sts. Peter & Paul remained within striking distance, the Royals began patiently working the ball around the perimeter before driving through the lane for layups that steadily extended their lead. Bohinski and Dukes each found an open lane for layups before McCoy's three-point play pushed Delmarva's Christian's lead to 36-26 late in the third.\n\"We made a couple shots that kind of got us going,\" Royals head coach Frank Roach said. \"The first two games, jump shots weren't really falling much. I think that helped. And then we changed up our defense a little bit in that third quarter and that gave us a little bit of breathing room. I think the defensive switch is what kind of broke the game open.\"\nThe switch from man-to-man to a box-and-one helped Delmarva Christian outscore the Sabres, 13-7, in the third. Still, Sts. Peter & Paul stuck around, Palmer scoring the last basket of the third and the first of the fourth, drawing the Sabres within 36-30.\nBut Marinelli scored on a drive through the paint, hit a 3-pointer, watched Dukes score a layup, then drove through the middle again to give the Royals a 45-32 lead with under 4 minutes remaining.\n\"I told them to space it out,\" Roach said of his team's offense. \"I know they (SSPP) were in a hurry to try to get some turnovers, get some steals. I said, 'Hey. Space the floor, use your handle. Let's attack the basket.' They did a good job attacking the basket.\"\nDelmarva Christian's lead floated between 13 and 15 points before McCall, who notched her sixth double-double of the season with 15 points and 10 rebounds — both team highs — scored the Sabres' final seven points.\n\"I think nerves had a lot to do with it,\" Murphy said of her team. \"I think in some cases we may have wanted to win too much instead of playing our game. Not settling into offense was a real huge thing. We were able to do that in the previous two games. And here they couldn't get their offensive rhythm no matter how many times we said, 'Run this offense. Do this. Slow it down.'\n\"Again, it's a young team,\" added Murphy, who has no seniors on the team. \"They have grown a lot and continue to learn. They're a great group of kids who fought until the very end. There's no reason why they can't do this again next year.\"\nNotes: McCall was named the ESIAC player of the year, and was joined on the all-conference first team by Rankin and Albright. … Hainey was honorable mention. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is a member of the Easton Rotary Club and works with Disaster Aid USA, a nonprofit that delivers disaster relief worldwide.\n\"Over the past term, I have had the privilege of working alongside dedicated council members, community leaders, and residents who are passionate about shaping Easton's future,\" Gunsallus wrote in an email to The Star Democrat. \"The trust placed in me to lead our town council is both humbling and inspiring, and I believe there is more work to be done to ensure Easton remains a vibrant, welcoming, and prosperous community.\"\nThe current president will have at least one opponent, as Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello announced his candidacy for the head council seat earlier this week. Abbatiello has been the Ward 2 representative since 2019.\nGunsallus says his main priorities if reelected are public safety and infrastructure, affordable housing, community engagement and economic development. On the topic of housing, he said it's an \"ongoing challenge\" and the town's making \"significant strides.\"\nIn 2023, Gunsallus won a special election for the presidential seat after previous president Megan Cook assumed the town's mayoral seat. At 35, he began his term as the youngest council president in Easton's history.\nWith more than a year under his belt, Gunsallus said he's learned \"the immense value of collaboration and listening.\"\n\"I have learned that effective leadership requires balancing the immediate needs of the community with a long-term vision for sustainable growth,\" Gunsallus wrote. \"This role has also reinforced the importance of adaptability and resilience, especially when navigating the challenges that come with governing a dynamic town like Easton.\"\nIn addition to council president, there will be Ward 2 and Ward 4 elections this spring.

The council unanimously passed legislation approving gas and electric rate revisions proposed by Easton Utilities.Armed with the approval, Easton Utilities will file formal rate increase requests with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The PSC will hold a public hearing on the proposed rates next year and make a final determination.\nFurther discussion on an ordinance amending the town code as it relates to bicycles will be postponed until the council's Jan. 2 meeting.

In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, ranking 21st in the state.\nDuring the meetingThursday, Jodi Colman, the district's assistant superintendent of academics and student services, showed proficiency rates and rankings in the state broken down by grade level.\nColman said there were eight grade levels where the district's state ranking in math increased and six grade levels where the district's state ranking in English increased.\nIn fifth grade science, where 14.4% of students were considered proficient on the 2024 MCAP assessment, the ranking went up to 20th in the state for 2024 compared to 22nd the previous year.\nColman said that at a statewide assistant superintendent meeting recently, Dorchester County was mentioned for its growth in third grade math, sixth grade math and middle school algebra.\n\"I thought that was nice to be highlighted across the state as seeing a district that is actually moving some of their scores,\" she said after mentioning that math scores across the state were pretty stagnant in the 2024 MCAP compared to the previous year.\nColman also brought up concerns regarding district MCAP scores.\nAccording to the data Colman shared, 30.6% of 10th graders scored proficient on the English assessment last school year, ranking last in the state.\nColman said the district is looking at its support pathway classes, which it hopes will affect the 10th grade data \"more significantly.\"\nColman also brought up elementary English scores. She said that as students go up in grade, English proficiency levels decrease.\nColman said there have been discussions about whether the district should resume using its instructional program for elementary English or adopt a new one. The district's language arts supervisor is researching this.\nMoving forward, the district is getting feedback from the state on a new comprehensive literacy plan, Colman said.\n\"We are also looking at, across the board, our tier one instruction for any content level,\" she said. \"Making sure that we're really using that instructional planning model, that we're thinking through strategically with our students and that do we have good, formative assessment data to use in order to change teaching within our classrooms. And I think we have a lot of work to do in that area.\"\nColman said that although the MCAP scores aren't \"exactly where we want them,\" there is hope in the county about increasing the scores going forward.\n\"So I'm excited about that,\" she said.\nAfter Colman's presentation, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said although the score increases might not be \"monumental,\" they show progress.\n\"If we continue that progress over the years, it will add up,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Beyond Oktoberfest and Halloween, many cities offer harvest festivals as local crops come into season. Others organize arts and crafts shows or music festivals, while local wineries debut their latest releases.The allure of fall foliage may put cars on the road, but the states on LawnStarter's shortlist have found creative ways to reward visitors for their interest.TOP FIVE STATES FOR VIEWING FALL FOLIAGECaliforniaCalifornia ranks at or near the top in virtually every metric used in the LawnStarter study. It has the most national parks, the most scenic drives, and the most Fall-related attractions. Outside of Sacramento, Apple Hill features over 50 local farms and a fall festival with apple cider donuts and u-pick pumpkin and apple venues. The Napa Valley is famous for its fall foliage, along with wine tastings and grape stomping adventures.New YorkOne measurement used in the LawnStarter study was the number of peak days for the leaf-watching season. New York ranked highest, with a total of 31 days of ideal leaf peeping available. New York is also home to the Finger Lakes, renowned for their cideries. Other points of interest include the Adirondacks and the Catskills for hiking and historical towns such as Sleepy Hollow for ghost chasing.WashingtonWashington State's mountainous and forested terrain offers adventurous foliage seekers over 12 weeks of peak viewing time. Besides a generous number of hiking trails and national parks, visitors to Washington State can also visit the alpinethemed village of Leavenworth for its Autumn Leaf Festival and enjoy adult beverages at local wineries.MichiganMichigan's extended foliage viewing season of 12 weeks makes it very appealing for Midwesterners who seek a more local destination than coastal states. Michigan also has a high number of cideries, ranking second overall in the Lawn-Starter study. A scenic drive north of Harbor Springs is known as the Tunnel of Trees and offers travelers breathtaking views of hardwood trees and their colorful leaves. The Pumpkin Train is another popular Fall-related attraction located in western Michigan.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania's abundance of undeveloped forests helps land it in the fifth position on the Lawn-Starter survey. The view of tree-covered hills and rolling pastures has enticed visitors for literally hundreds of years. The Pocono Mountains host the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Foliage Festival, a ghost tour, and a scenic train ride.THE BEST TIME TO GO LEAF PEEPINGWhile the first leaves may start to change as early as mid-September, the peak Fall foliage season doesn't generally arrive until the middle to late part of October, when air temperatures also begin to drop in many regions. The most colorful part of the transition is often over by Thanksgiving, as leaves fade to brown and trees become bare.Min Park, Ph.D., Academic Program Coordinator School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management at George Mason University, says, \"In general, fall foliage peaks in most parts of the nation in mid-October through mid-November.Some mountains in the northwest are often at their most colorful in mid-September to early October.\"As I live in Virginia, Virginia's Shenandoah National Park is one of the best for fall colors. The best time to experience gorgeous fall colors in Shenandoah National Park is in October. Visitors can make the scenic cruise along the 105-mile-long Skyline Drive, which offers 70 overlooks where travelers can hop out of the car for a better view of foliage with red, yellow, and orange leaves.\".FALL FESTIVALS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONSEven if fall foliage is not at its peak or travel options are limited, there are still many Autumnal activities individuals and families can enjoy. In many areas of the country, the temperatures and climate are still favorable for camping, hiking, and attending outdoor festivals.Rosa Abreu, Assistant Professor, Hospitality Management, New York City College of Technology, offers her suggestions for a satisfying fall-related excursion. \"Stay in a place that has a fire pit and roast marshmallows. Have a few drinks by the fire. Go glamping. Pumpkin and apple picking is always fun.\" Other fall-related festivals and destinations you might want to check out include: Morton Pumpkin Festival, Morton, Illinois The village of Morton, Illinois, produces almost all of the canned pumpkin products in the international market. The village considers itself to be the pumpkin capital of the world and celebrates annually with the Morton Pumpkin Festival in September.Salem, Massachusetts, Haunted ToursThe small coastal city of Salem, Massachusetts, has become a popular fall destination because of its association with the Salem witch trials. The city hosts several festivals throughout the fall season and guided tours of local landmarks.Vermont's Sugarhouses and Maple SyrupThe state of Vermont supplies over half of the country's maple syrup, and the fall months are the best time to watch the process unfold. Numerous sugarhouses in Vermont provide guided tours of their facilities, and guests also enjoy a taste of small-town New England life.World's Largest Corn Maze, Spring Grove, Illinois Corn mazes, hayrides, and harvest festivals are always popular destinations for families, and Richardson Farm in Spring Grove, Illinois, offers over 9 miles of hayride trails and mazes on its 28-acre cornfield.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/FLEMMING CHRISTIANSEN\n \nThere are plenty of places locally, across Maryland as well as travel spots nationally to check out autumn leaves and fall events.\n \nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS/LIZ WEST\n \nNew England is a popular destination to enjoy the sights of fall and the changing of the leaves \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A 'smart buoy' is coming to St. Michaels harbor\n\n November 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Environment \n \n 325\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — On Wednesday evening, Andrew David Thaler carried a large wooden device with yellow cords piled in its interior and a yellow and black top into the St. Michaels commissioners meeting.Thaler, a member of the St. Michaels Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission, smiled as he eagerly presented the \"smart buoy.\"\nWith the permission of the commissioners, the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission will put the buoy in the harbor to monitor water levels and flooding.\n\"What this buoy will do is it measures sea state, so we get sea surface temperature, we get wave action on the surface,\" Thaler said. \"And then we'll also have a pressure gage at the bottom of the mooring, which we'll be able to use to assess tidal head. So that'll give us both the actual tidal cycle coming into the harbor, as well as any storm surges coming up from the bay.\"\nAccording to Thaler, one of the long-term goals of the commission is to look into the viability of having the town's own tide gage.\nThe reasoning behind this goal is to gather specific data of St. Michaels tide pH. Currently, the data gathered for nuisance flooding, tidal surges and storm surges come from three sites. The sites are gages from Cambridge, Annapolis and Clayburn. Which are too far from St. Michaels to accurately gather information for the town.\nThaler said last year the commission applied for an equipment grant from So Far Ocean, a company that makes smart buoys. The presented device will gather data in real time and is solar powered.\nThaler said the location of the smart buoy will not interfere with boat traffic and will be located in the lagoon between Honeymoon Bridge and Mill Street. It comes at no cost to the town.\nAfter the presentation, the St. Michaels commissioners thanked Thaler and the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission for all their efforts. Commissioners will vote on the use of a smart buoy during a future meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Historic Sotterley screens, holds panel discussion on 'Grandma's Hands'\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 665\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Family recipes are passed down through the generations and the film \"Grandma's Hands\" focuses on six Southern Maryland individuals who cherish those recipes.Historic Sotterley held a screening and panel discussion with the stars of the film along with writer, executive producer, director and narrator Craig Sewell on Nov. 13 at the museum in Hollywood.\n\"This was a passion project for me,\" said Sewell. \"Kitchens are magic places, whether they're commercial kitchens or home kitchens, because it's about where everything happens. It's where smiles happen and tears happen and stories happen and the aromas happen. Kitchens are places where people come together.\"\nThe 58-minute film was funded through a Maryland Heritage Areas Authority grant and filmed by the Southern Maryland National Heritage Area.\n\"Ask someone about their grandmother and chances are the story will quickly end up in the kitchen. And once there, the real story begins,\" Sewell said to open the film. \"Lives change, but the food will always be with us. Food is powerful. It nourishes our bodies, it excites our tastes, it is infused and marinated in emotion and it provides us with a solid connection to our past. For generations our grandma's hands have made memories, continued traditions and blessed us with the knowledge of who we are.\"\nThe film stars six individuals who recreate their grandmother's recipes: Lexington Park's Teandre Thompson (bread pudding), Waldorf's Mary Louise Booth Webb (crackling bread), Newburg's Tiffany Barber (tomato sauce with meatballs), Benedict's Franklin A. Robinson (chili sauce), Greenbelt's LaWann Stribling (macaroni and cheese) and Lothian's Kayla Griffith (sweet potato pancakes).\nThompson said her grandmother Theresa Young would create \"a masterpiece dessert using a few ingredients and her hands. She didn't use measuring cups and spoons; she did it just by sight. I'm not that daring yet.\"\nThe 98-year-old Webb, who cooked the dish in her grandmother's farm kitchen located near Zekiah Swamp, said it was made as a way to use everything of the pig.\nRobinson, who lives at Serenity Farm, said his grandmother would make the sauce at the end of the tobacco harvest.\n\"For me these recipes are a way of keeping all of these people I've known alive,\" Robinson said. \"Every time I open the cookbook, I remember my grandmother at her wood stove and my other grandmother who lived on another farm. It's remembering them and honoring them.\"\nBarber, who lives on Grace Haven Farm, said her grandmother would take Wonder bread, slather it with the sauce and layer it with Parmesan cheese.\n\"My grandmother's recipes were the center of my childhood,\" Barber, who still uses her grandmother's cast iron skillet, said in the film, \"and it's something I carry forward with my kids.\"\nBarber said dinner at her two-table dining room — which is essential for eight children and five grandchildren — \"became that place where you learned to express yourself, having conversations about what matters to you and those connections. Dinner matters, meals matter. It's the connection you build around that meal.\"\nGriffith, who lives on the family farm, said her grandmother Lillian would make pancakes with chocolate chips, whipped cream, sprinkles, \"the whole nine yards\"\n\"She could not sit down for more than a minute or two,\" she added. \"She would get up, make sure everyone had something on their plate. To most of us she would say, 'You don't have enough,' but [to my grandfather it would be] 'Earl, you're eating too much.'\"\nThe film viewing earlier this month was the season finale of Historic Sotterley's Common Ground series.\n\"Throughout the peninsula that is Southern Maryland, people have gathered, cooked for centuries,\" Sewell says in the opening minutes of the film. \"The recipes are messengers from whence we came. Food and recipes can divide a family, a region, even a culture.\"\nMaryland Public Television will air a 27-minute version of the film — focusing on three of the cooks — at 7 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 23.\nThe hour-long version of the film will premiere on mpt.org, pbs.org and the PBS app starting on Sunday, Nov. 24.\nFind out more about the film at destinationsouthernmaryland.com/discover/grandmas-hands. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The photos of Ellie Griffin, Norah Smith, Harrison Bonovitch, Arthur Schaefer and Josiah Gross were selected from more than 2,600 entries in the society's call for photos.\nEllie, Norah and Arthur are from St. Mary's County and Harrison and Josiah are from Calvert County. Their photos will be displayed on two screens in Times Square above Dos Caminos restaurant in Father Duffy Square.\nEllie is 5 and was diagnosed with Down syndrome when she was born, Jessica Griffin, Ellie's mom, said. Ellie was also selected to be in the video in 2022, but this is the first time the family is going to New York to see it.\n\"I can't wait to see her reaction,\" Griffin said before the event. \"Hopefully she realizes what's happening.\"\nWhile Ellie might not understand everything that's happening, her 8-year-old brother is excited and \"thinks she's famous,\" the mother said.\nOutside of the national society, the family participates with other Down syndrome organizations, Griffin said. They do fundraisers with the Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network and have raised over $20,000 to connect families who are new to the condition, in which a person is born with an extra chromosome causing mild to moderate cognitive disability, developmental delays and physical challenges.\n\"It's amazing the support that we get through our community,\" Griffin said.\nGriffin is also a parent volunteer with Jack's Baskets, which hand delivers baskets with gifts and resources for families to celebrate babies with Down syndrome.\nThe Times Square video presentation kicks off the New York City Buddy Walk. The walk has taken place in New York City since 1995 as part of the National Buddy Walk Program.\nThe National Down Syndrome Society video allows Ellie and the other Southern Maryland residents to advocate the message of inclusion, Griffin said. The photos were taken by 21FIVE Photography by Teresa Tucker, a resident in Southern Maryland who did free photoshoots for the kids to submit to the society.\n\"Everyone's goal is to support their kids and help them be the best versions of themselves,\" Griffin said.\nEllie does not have a lot of words, but she is a huge Taylor Swift fan, Griffin said. When Swift plays Ellie screams \"Tay Tay\" and starts dancing and singing.\n\"She's been hitting a lot of the words to the songs,\" Griffen said. \"We think it's actually helped improve her language and speech skills.\"\nThe presentation was slated to be live-streamed on the National Down Syndrome Society Facebook page from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 6. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Despite any self-doubt, Payne said, those gathered in the theater that evening were there to celebrate their own accomplishments and honor their potential to initiate positive change.\nIn the crowd were some of more than 200 nominees for this year's Women to Watch magazine, an annual publication by APG Chesapeake recognizing the contributions of women to Mid-Shore workplaces and communities.\nThe women, who were nominated via an online portal by coworkers, friends, spouses and loved ones, represented a wide swath of Mid-Shore change-makers.\n\"It was a wonderful evening to celebrate the power, success and perseverance of women to watch in the Mid-Shore,\" said Orestes Baez, regional president of APG Chesapeake. \"Everyone had a great story to tell and a great energy to share. APG Chesapeake did a wonderful job putting all the pieces together. We are thankful for the opportunity to share it with the public.\"\nThe event marked the launch of the fifth Women to Watch magazine, a preliminary printed version of which was unveiled at the Avalon that evening. The magazine will be inserted into the Star Democrat and available online April 23.\nPayne, who works through her nonprofit The BE Academy to empower women entrepreneurs, is one of 14 women featured in this year's edition. She was the first of three speakers to offer advice to those gathered April 9.\nYixin Qiu, co-founder of Apollo's Dream Foundation and a technical project manager for Qlarant, shared how she has worked to generate positive change in the Eastern Shore community that welcomed her as an immigrant a decade ago. Qiu helped found a nonprofit aiding senior citizens with digital literacy.\nJackie Wilson, senior vice president at Burke and Herbert Bank, shared advice for women experiencing change or uncertainty in their careers. She encouraged women to embrace change and rely on their expertise and the expertise of their teams to navigate challenges.\n\"What an uplifting evening,\" said Betsy Griffin, APG Chesapeake general manager for sales and marketing. \"It was great to see Mid-Shore women connecting and networking with other leaders. We are honored to provide a refreshing evening celebrating these women who serve in the community and excel in their workplaces.

Each chapter provides readers with new ways to level up their self-worth, conveyed through a tone that Polo said is fun and inviting.\n\"The book is called 'Self-Love Shenanigans' because I didn't want it to be too serious,\" Polo said, \"It is a serious topic but it is also fun and I wrote it the same way I would say it.\"\nPolo's inspiration for the book follows her self-love journey and her experiences. Through her journey, Polo said she began to realize that she was developing knowledge and mindsets that other people tend to struggle with.\nShe explained that she has struggled with self-love and self-worth her whole life and that her book is home to all of the work she has done and what has worked for her throughout her journey.\n\"Everything that is in the books is all things that I went through in my life and writing the book,\" Polo said. \"I wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel, I just wanted to put it all in one place with my own spin on things by looking at things a bit differently to help people.\"\nComplementing Polo's messages on self-love in the book are numerous activities involving journaling and other growth activities to help readers build a deeper connection with the content.\nPolo said that her inspiration to include activities in her book stems from her value of putting action behind learning.\n\"You can read everything about self-love but without action, I assert, it will not make much difference which is why the activities are important- so people can bring and apply the content to themselves,\" Polo said.\nThe 147-page book was mostly written before Polo and her husband moved from New York to a home on North East's Main Street last year. While simultaneously writing her book, Polo started the Self-Love Shenanigans and Stories Collective Facebook group.\nThe group has over 175 members and serves as a hub for members to share their experiences, self-love tips and new ways to achieve self-love. Since moving to North East, Polo said her value of the community she is creating has grown.\n\"Walking Main Street every morning really gives me a sense of being part of a community,\" Polo said. \"Being in an area that is this community centered, I started to see the bigger picture and realize that it is not just about myself and my readers, it is about the community that we are creating around self-love and its value.\"\nPolo noted that she hosted a virtual launch party for her book Tuesday night. Readers and supporters from all over the country attended — buying her book the second sales went live on Amazon.\nThe book is currently on sale for $0.99 cents.\nAs of press time Thursday, \"Self-Love Shenanigans\" is ranked number one in several of Amazon's bestseller categories, including Journal Writing, Women's Inspirational Spirituality and the New Age Self-Help category.\nSince launch, Polo said she has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from her readers.\n\"My heart is so full because of the feedback I have received so far,\" Polo said. \"You write something and you hope it is good and makes a difference so to have the book make a positive impact bigger than I could have imagined, it brings me to tears when I think about it.\"\nCurrently, \"Self-Love Shenanigans\" is only available virtually through Kindle. Polo is preparing to deploy the book in paperback within the coming weeks, and plans to collaborate with Cecil County retailers to sell her product.\nPolo also plans to work with Cecil County libraries to host events and workshops involving self-love exercises outlined in her book along with other activities.\n\"My book is not about convincing yourself into something positive you do not believe,\" Polo said. \"It is all about being open to the idea that 'maybe it is true' and starting to believe it and it has been wonderful to be able to help people and share what I know.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County officials share why substance use awareness is bigger than just a month\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — While all Caroline County substance use awareness programs acknowledge the importance of \"Caroline Goes Purple\" in September, they know the work is done all year-round.The Caroline County Health Department credits this work for a dramatic reduction in overdoses.\nAccording to Health Department officials, in 2023, Caroline County experienced 19 overdoses. In 2024, the number was less than 11 overdoses, and that trend seems to be continuing this year.\nWhen number is under 11, the county is not allowed to share the exact number due to state regulations, officials said.\nThe efforts to reduce overdoses are celebrated during the month of September, when the county holds multiple substance use awareness events to connect residents to services the county provides. Jessica Tuel, director of Caroline County Behavioral Health and director for Caroline Goes Purple, said all these events are designed to show residents they're not alone.\n\"I think that people need to understand that a lot of these events are obviously to bring education and prevention services, but it's also to provide connection to those who are experiencing substance use,\" Tuel said. \"We have a motto here. It is 'the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it is human connection.' So, by bringing these things to the community, number one, it gives a level of education and prevention services, but it also helps those who have been through it or going through it know that they're not alone.\"\nThis is a goal stakeholders in Caroline County try to meet outside of September.\nMonthly, the county and several municipalities hold joint meeting, called the Drug Free Caroline Group, to close gaps in service so the county can be strong year-round.\n\"We have a local drug and alcohol council meeting once a month to discuss trends that's happening,\" said Sloane Franklin, Caroline County state's attorney. \"It has the law enforcement, courts, mental health, and substance abuse counselors, clergy, county behavioral health or substance abuse programs… We talk about grants that might be available to our partners to go out, and I seek those grants so they can continue to provide services to these people.\"\nThese services include a \"safe station\" located at the Caroline County Sheriff's Office.\nThe safe station allows an individual to come into the Sheriff's Office and say, \"I need help.\" An off-duty officer will then search the person and confiscate any paraphernalia without charging the person.\nThe Sheriff's Office also has an on-site peer, Kristie Thompson, five days a week in partnership with the Sante Group. Thompson goes into the community and makes residents aware of options available.\nThompson said the goal is to get the individual experiencing substance-related difficulties into inpatient treatment.\n\"Our partnership and relationship with Sante Group is is definitely a high point for the county as far as being able to provide this service to citizens of Caroline County,\" Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker said. \"As far as working out of this building, having one of their employees here being able to people who are in distress needing support services or wanting to get off controlled dangerous substances, I think that is definitely a high point when you can take somebody and give them the services they need.\"\nThe Health Department is another community partner that helps residents be aware of the dangers of substance use and their options. Tuel highlighted some of the services the Behavioral Health extension offers.\n\"We have a level one outpatient mental health and substance use program,\" Tuel said. \"We serve a lot of different people throughout various stages of substance use. We provide medication-assisted treatment, as well and we have clinicians in the schools. We do mobile treatment for adults and for kids at the both high schools, and we're expanding into the middle schools. We try to offer as many services as we are able to as a public health system.\"\nTuel said the key to reducing overdoes in the county has been including peers who have lived the experience to help others still struggling.\n\"I think that in the last couple of years, we've done a really great job of including peers,\" Tuel said. \"Peers are those who have lived experience and are on the other side of it. They've really given us a great perspective and hope that we're doing the right thing and that there is success in this.\n\"I think that sometimes as first responders, and sometimes people in our field, what happens is we get very discouraged because we don't see the hope at the end. Having peers embedded in a lot of these services, like at the sheriff's department and in our services at the Health Department and throughout the community, it really even gives us hope that we're doing the right thing and that we're on the right path and that people can heal and they can get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bikes, scooters need to show caution\n\n October 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week, I met and spoke with Easton Police Department Officer Hugo Galan while walking on the Rails to Trails. We talked after he spoke to a man riding a motorized bicycle about keeping safety in mind as he traveled the trails.I told him my concerns about more and more riders of electric bikes, scooters and skateboards whizzing along on the trails with seemingly little regard for pedestrians. If these riders were on the street, the speed probably wouldn't be as noticeable, but when you're walking, it feels really fast as they zip by, startling because you often don't hear them until they're next to you.\nAnd, it happens without warning, like signaling with the ringing of a bicycle bell behind you, or, as some kindly people do, call out to let you know what side they're passing on. Careless riders will zig-zag at top speed between older adults walking dogs, little kids on bikes and scooters, or moms pushing strollers with small children in tow. It's frightening to watch because one misstep could result in something terrible.\nThe Rails to Trails through Easton is a pedestrian highway for hundreds of people. Some without transportation use it to get to jobs. Schoolchildren use it to get to and from school. And for others, it's a daily exercise routine or a way to simply enjoy the outdoors. But with more motorized bikes, scooters and even skateboards, the safety and peacefulness of walking on the trails has changed. Walkers have to factor in the possibility of being hit, adding a lot more caution to each stroll.\nEaston residents have been speaking up about the uptick of speeding on the trails, expressing concerns to the police department and to town officials. Officer Galan said the Easton Police Department has expanded its outreach and patrols to increase safety awareness among riders, urging them to slow down as they approach walkers and runners. I applaud these conversations, the extra patrols and other actions the police take each day, particularly at night when no one should be on the trails or in the parks, to keep all of us safe.\nIt is reassuring to see officers on the trails engaging with the public in positive ways to increase everyone's awareness. But most importantly, riders need to show more courtesy to walkers and slow down. We all use the trail and we want to enjoy it safely.\nBARBARA SAUERS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Tony Shalhoub returns as \"Monk\" in new Peacock movie\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the way that popular series of the past have been recycled - even in the streaming era that has added so much content - the second coming of \"Monk\" may not be that huge a surprise.As it happens, streaming is the avenue by which Tony Shalhoub is reprising his multiple-Primetime Emmy-winning portrayal of obsessive-compulsive detective Adrian Monk. Peacock premieres \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" on Friday, Dec. 8, with the hugely phobic title character on a very personal mission to help his journalist step-daughter Molly (\"Home Economics\" alum Caitlin McGee) when tragedy strikes as her wedding nears. The film might claim that this is Monk's final investigation, but of course, a ratings triumph for the picture can change that notion easily. (Consider that there have been three movie sequels to another former USA Network series, \"Psych,\" and a fourth has been under discussion.) Also an executive producer of the new film, Shalhoub isn't the only \"Monk' veteran returning for it. Series creator Andy Breckman (\"The Good Cop\") wrote the script and returns as an executive producer as well (with \"Hit & Run's\" David Hobernan also reprising the latter job), and Randy Zisk (\"Midnight Caller\") - who directed many of the original show's episodes, including the finale - calls the shots again on the movie.Other familiar faces from the \"Monk\" cast also are back. Traylor Howard (\"Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place\") again plays Natalie Teeger, who was Monk's second assistant on the show; Ted Levine (\"The Silence of the Lambs,\" 1991) and Jason Gray-Stanford (\"A Beautiful Mind,\" 2001) return as the police-connected Leland Stottlemeyer and Randy Disher; Hector Elizondo (\"Last Man Standing\") resurfaces as psychiatrist Neven Bell; and Melora Hardin (\"The Office\") resurfaces as Monk's late wife Trudy.\"Monk\" premiered on USA Network in 2002 and enjoyed an eight-season run, with Shalhoub earning three Primetime Emmy Awards for it along the way. John Turturro (\"Barton Fink,\" 1991) and Stanley Tucci (\"Big Night,\" 1996) each picked up an Emmy for guest stints on the show, and Randy Newman (\"Toy Story,\" 1995) won two of the honors for his musical contributions to it. Shalhoub also won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for the program.The series brought stardom to Shalhoub after his tenure as a respected supporting actor on stage and screen. When \"Monk\" began, he was known to viewers largely as Antonio on the sitcom \"Wings,\" and he also had gained notice for roles in such movies as \"Big Night\" (1996, with the aforementioned Tucci) and \"The Siege\" (1998). He also had earned the first of what would be his four Tony Award nominations to date, for \"Conversations With My Father\" (1992); his others have been for \"Golden Boy\" (2013), \"Act One\" (2014) and \"The Band's Visit\" (2017), and he won the honor for the latter play.For now, though, it's back to \"Monk\" territory for Shalhoub's - and though \"Last\" is in the movie's name, don't necessarily bank on that being the fact. \n \n Caption: Tony Shalhoub in \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Where did she get her start?A: The British Columbia native started out studying dancing as her principal path in show business, but her main attention shifted to acting when she was accepted at Toronto's Randolph Academy. She began doing guest roles on such series as \"Murdoch Mysteries\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" then continued with appearances on shows including \"When Calls the Heart\" and \"The Bold Type.\" Around the time of the later guest shots, Kohan also started getting prominent parts in cable movies on the order of \"The Black Widow Killer\" (2018) and \"Love on Harbor Island\" (2020). The fact that those have been repeated often didn't hurt her chances to land the lead in \"Sullivan's Crossing,\" Among other movies that have featured Kohan are \"A Romance Wedding\" (2021) and \"A Whirlwind Wedding\" (2021), and she also was seen on the shows \"Batwoman,\" \"Transplant\" and \"When Hope Calls.\" Inspired by novels by Robyn Carr, \"Sullivan's Crossing\" (which already has been renewed for a second season) originated on Canada's CTV network, and its inclusion of two veterans of The CW in its regular cast - Chad Michael Murray (\"One Tree Hill\") and Scott Patterson (\"Gilmore Girls\") - likely got the latter outlet interested in picking up the series for the American market, especially when production delays linked to the entertainment-industry strikes made finding product from other sources a necessity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members said the debt likely stems from families choosing not to pay or failing to submit annual free/reduced lunch forms.\nThe school system did not respond for more information by deadline.\n\"These are families who make above whatever the threshold is to qualify and they are able to pay for lunch. They are able to pack their student's lunch. … There are options,\" board member Jamila Smith said. \"It's a choice just not to pay.\"\nThe board provided school principals lists of students with outstanding balances to contact families, encouraging repayment plans and assisting with lunch forms.\n\"And we do recognize that families are in different situations now, given that there are work closures, reductions in force, a variety of things that are happening,\" Smith said. \"But this has been going on well before that even began.\"\nBoard member Samichie Thomas emphasized the importance of filling out the lunch forms every year, or the school does not know if a family qualifies for the program that reimburses the school system for low-income students' lunches.\n\"I was a parent of four. You get all these forms and all these things at the beginning of the school year,\" Thomas said. \"Make sure you take the time to fill out the form because that's how the school can help you. … You can do it online.\"\nThe board is now considering stronger actions, including possibly sending unpaid debts to collections. The board will revisit the issue in July once the end-of-year payment window closes and final figures are available, giving families until end of June to pay their outstanding balance.\nFor now, board members are stressing outreach at every level to make families aware.\nBoard member Dottery Butler-Washington said, \"You have to say something three or four times for somebody to actually get it.\"\nThe full transfer plan vote is set for July when actual figures replace projections.\nNew substitute bus wages OK'dThe school board unanimously approved a raise for substitute bus drivers, boosting hourly wages.\nNew wages will be between $20 and 22.50, up $2.50 per hour. The increase, tied to 2026 budget, keeps pay competitive with full-time drivers and will cost an estimated $20,000 extra. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The shell is washed off the boat onto the waiting river floor below the surface.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program seeks to make plantings an annual tradition and encourage more neighboring rivers to join in initiatives to locally support their waterways, according to Burleson.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program Fund is a non-profit of the Mid Shore Community Foundation.\nMore information about Seed to Shuck Ventures can be found at seedtoshuck.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The interaction came as Hurricane Franklin was barreling through the Atlantic Ocean.Baluchi told the Coast Guard he was propelling his vessel to London.\"Based on the condition of the vessel - which was afloat as a result of wiring and buoys - USCG officers determined Baluchi was conducting a manifestly unsafe voyage,\" according to a criminal complaint filed with a U.S.District Court in Florida.Baluchi resisted efforts to stop his transatlantic voyage, including warnings of the hurricane, and on Aug. 26 and Aug 27 threatened to hurt or kill himself with a \"12-inch knife\" and also claimed to have a bomb on board, according to the USCG.By Aug. 28, Baluchi told the Coast Guard there was no bomb on his floating hamster wheel and the next day \"USCG officers were able to safely disembark Baluchi from the vessel,\" according to the arrest affidavit.The oceanic adventurer was brought ashore Sept. 1.The Coast Guard said the Pompano Beach man has tried to make oceanic Hydro Pod voyages in 2014, 2016 and 2021 all resulting in USCG 'interventions'.Baluchi traversed the Atlantic waters from Florida to Bermuda in 2020, according to a Vice News report.Baluchi's interest in self-propelled oceanic travels as well as long-distance running with goals of running through every country in the world are outlined on his Facebook and other social media pages and website.

Her unique personality left a big impression because years later, the kitten would be the subject of Mugele's first children's book, \"Jingles Goes to School.\"\nLate October, Bumble Bee Books, the children's publishing department of Olympia Publishers, put out the book and can now be purchased at Bumblebee Books website, on Amazon, and locally here at the Book Plate, in downtown Chestertown.\nMugele based her book off her childhood, even mentioning her home, the house with the red shutters at 19 Bonney Lane. That was where Jingles escaped from back then, braving the New England winters to follow Mugele to school. Mugele's mother had to place her infant son in a stroller to come pick up Jingles.\n\"That's not normal behavior for a cat,\" Mugele said laughing.\nThis amusing anecdote is the plot of the book.\nIn between the colorful illustrated pages, Jingles displays to Nancy's teacher, Miss Bevivino, her class, and the principal, Mr. Willett, her love of learning. At one point, Jingles even plays the piano, \"learning to trill in all the right places,\" at the school concert.\nWill Jingles earn the affection of some of her harshest critics, like the principal?\nOne thing is for sure, Jingles loves school, and so does her creator, the Head of Kent School of nine years with a career in education over 20 years.\n\"It's really remarkable, the transformative power of books,\" Mugele expressed.\nShe witnesses this on a weekly basis, reading Jingles' adventures to her pre-k, kindergarten, and first graders, seeing their reactions.\n\"They absolutely love it. They ask a lot of questions. It's such a thrill when I show them actual pictures of Jingles, and see how their imaginations expand.\"\nFrom her enjoyment of reading aloud to her students, she pitched her story to eight publishers, and heard back from three of them — no small feat for a new author.\nOlympia Publishers appreciated that Mugele drew from her own experiences. They took care of the artwork and distribution, leaving Mugele to dream up future stories for Jingles.\nIn the meantime, \"Jingles Goes to School,\" will be coming out in hardback Jan. 30, and in the near future the author plans to do local book tours. She will also be doing one for a friend at Farley's Bookshop in Pennsylvania.\nHer passion however is to visit schools, reading to the kids.\n\"It is one of my most important meetings throughout the week,\" Mugele said.\nShe hones her writing skills on her blog site nancymugele.com, while envisioning new adventures to pen.\nAnd as she looks for more inspiration from her life, nobody is safe, especially her lovable black lab, \"River.\"\n\"He won't mind one bit if I make him the star,\" Mugele said with a smile. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In their hands are sleek trays, cups and other products receiving careful changes under heavy machinery.Each person, in protective gear, carefully works to create countless commemorative products engraved with Americana symbols for the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\nMore than 600 products were sent to Washington earlier this week, where they were received by members of Trump's team as part of a longstanding tradition at Salisbury.\nThe company has a rich history of providing engraved commemorative gifts for presidents and other government officials.\nFor over 30 years, Salisbury has crafted engraved pewter trays, picture frames, jewelry boxes and 700 other products showing appreciation for the country.\nIn preparation for the 2025 inauguration, the Salisbury team has been crafting items featuring Trump's signature and other symbols of the presidency.\nJoseph Bernstein, sales manager for Salisbury, said they are proud to continue the tradition of pewter work.\n\"Pewter in itself has a rich history,\" Bernstein said. \"Paul Revere was a pewter smith. Pewter was brought over from England to America, and we made it our own. So we have a rich tradition of making pewter smithing in this country.\n\"It is, in itself, Americana. They're valuable keepsakes and commemoratives that can be passed down for generations.\"\nBernstein said the company started crafting items for politicians during the Ronald Reagan presidency. During his time in office, Reagan had his presidential seal with his and first lady Nancy Reagan's signatures turned into Americana products.\nSince then, the company has made similar products for U.S. senators and representatives, other presidents and for commemorative events.\nThe products being prepared with engraved signatures will have several uses, Bernstein shared. Some of the products are in preparation for the president-elect, who, according to Bernstein, purchases the products from Salisbury with donations and uses them as gifts and for personal use.\nDuring Trump's last term in office, his team would order between 50 to 100 pieces from time to time, sometimes putting in orders for additional products when he was traveling to visit other leaders nationally and internationally.\nAdditionally, different organizations will purchase the products to use for events.\nAccording to Bernstein, Salisbury's products are in no way a political statement, and the company has gone out of its way to stay out of politics due to polarization. The company is proud to serve Republicans, Democrats and other parties \"all with the same respect.\"\nFor Bernstein, appreciation for Americana goes beyond political lines. He shared that julep cups, a drinking vessel traditionally used to serve mint julep, is his favorite type of product. Bernstein describes it as \"if you were drinking from a fine leaded crystal, just one of those things that enhances the experience.\"\nOverall, Bernstein said as they prepare for the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the company is working hard to provide its best products and is excited to continue to serve every political representative in the future.\n\"Salisbury has been around since 1979, and we are proud to be, to serve, we are proud to be on the Eastern Shore and commemorated, and proud to be a small part of commemorating our American heritage,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

George B. McClellan as general-in-chief of the Union armies, leaving him in command of the Army of the Potomac, a post McClellan also ended up losing.\nIn 1918, what were believed to be the first confirmed U.S. cases of a deadly global flu pandemic were reported among U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas; 46 soldiers would die. (The worldwide outbreak of influenza claimed an estimated 20 to 40 million lives.)\nIn 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease Bill, providing war supplies to countries fighting the Axis.\nIn 1942, as Japanese forces continued to advance in the Pacific during World War II, U.S. Army Gen.

Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., and his subcommittee's chief counsel, Roy Cohn, had exerted pressure to obtain favored treatment for Pvt. G. David Schine, a former consultant to the subcommittee. (The confrontation culminated in the famous Senate Army-McCarthy hearings.)\nIn 1985, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was chosen to succeed the late Konstantin U. Chernenko as general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.\nIn 1997, Paul McCartney was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn 2002, two columns of light soared skyward from Ground Zero in New York as a temporary memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks six months earlier.\nIn 2004, ten bombs exploded in quick succession across the commuter rail network in Madrid, Spain, killing 191 people in an attack linked to al-Qaida-inspired militants.\nIn 2006, former Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic was found dead of a heart attack in his prison cell in the Netherlands, abruptly ending his four-year U.N. war crimes trial; he was 64.\nIn 2010, a federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld the use of the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. currency.\nIn 2012, U.S. Army Staff Sgt.

    "content": "Striped bass need summer vacation to thrive\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALISON COLDEN Bay Journal News Service | Section: Columns \n \n 815\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There's a shift happening in Chesapeake Bay angling.\"People are pivoting, and they should be,\" said David Sikorski, executive director of the Coastal Conservation Association in Maryland. \"It used to be all stripers all the time. I find now more people view angling as an experience on the water, versus needing to target an exact species.\"\nSikorski is worried about the dire state of the striped bass population. Recent years have seen troubling trends — below average numbers for five years straight in Maryland's juvenile striped bass survey, fewer citation-sized stripers being registered in Virginia, and a steep decline in the Bay's commercial striped bass catch.\nThere are many reasons for these trends, ranging from overfishing and climate change to pollution and loss of habitat. But changing fishing habits is the only immediate way to make a difference.\nChesapeake Bay states and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have taken action with new regulations. The tough new reality also is being met by a new generation of anglers.\nWhile stripers remain a staple, other species — especially invasives like blue catfish and snakeheads — are increasing in popularity.\n\"Blue catfish are available in every tributary of the Bay and provide endless recreational angling options, with no limits,\" Sikorski said. \"They're attracting new anglers across the watershed all year round.\"\nThe regional publication FishTalk hosts monthly invasive species fishing reports. On social media, hundreds of thousands of people are following catfish anglers like TikTok personality Haz Life Fishing and Ernest Robinson, whose half a million Instagram followers know him as Ernie the Hog Snatcher.\nWhile fishing for schoolie stripers is tempting these warm summer days, it's also when striped bass are most vulnerable. With the right steps now, we can rebuild a healthy striped bass fishery for the future. Anglers can start by giving stripers a well-deserved summer vacation.\nAbout 90% of striped bass caught recreationally are released, according to ASMFC stock assessment data. But a significant number of these fish die, especially on hot summer days.\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission data assumes that about 9% of stripers that are caught and released will die from the stress. But that's the year-round number; the percentage is likely much higher in the summer, when heat causes low-oxygen levels in the water, increasing striped bass heart rates and hindering their ability to swim, find food and fight disease.\nTo address this, this year the commission established a catch-and-release mortality workgroup to explore options to reduce the loss of released fish.\nMaryland also has implemented regulations prohibiting striped bass fishing from July 16 to July 31, when striped bass are particularly stressed by high temperatures. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources posts heat warnings when air temperatures are above 90 degrees.\nThe season will reopen Aug. 1 and run through Dec. 10. Anglers may keep one striped bass from 19 to 24 inches per person, per day.\nSummer is prime time for catching many other species, including northern snakehead (also known as Chesapeake channa), white perch and yellow perch in the upper Bay and its rivers. In the southern Bay, where salinity is higher, expect to find cobia, red drum, speckled trout and Spanish mackerel.\nBlue catfish can be caught in every Bay tributary, year-round. Introduced into the Bay watershed in the 1970s, these catfish have since become voracious predators of beloved native species like striped bass, oysters and blue crabs.\nThe Maryland Office of Tourism's Fish & Hunt Maryland recently added a Catfish Trail resource to help anglers target these aggressive and fun-to-catch predators. Many prime catfishing spots are easily accessible from the shore, where you can use basic tackle and cheap bait (try dipping raw chicken in Kool-Aid).\nBlue cats also make for a great meal. Unlike other catfish species that are mainly bottom feeders, blue catfish have a more varied diet and are known for their tasty white, flaky fillets. Summer is an ideal time to catch the smaller, younger blue catfish that taste best.\nIf you do target stripers this summer, there are steps you can take to responsibly fish them. The maximum catch size for striped bass in the Bay is 24 inches, because bigger fish most effectively reproduce and rebuild the population. Older, larger females produce far more eggs and are key to repopulation efforts.\nThe last time we saw a strong number of juvenile striped bass in the Bay was in 2015. These have grown into the big fish being caught today.\nAnglers can help ensure fish survival by practicing safe catch and release tactics, such as using barbless circle hooks, keeping fish in the water and supporting them with two hands if handling.\nSustainable fisheries require long-term forethought and, sometimes, short-term sacrifice. If we want a striped bass fishery in the future, we need to pivot. Let's give striped bass a summer break.\nAllison Colden is the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Maryland Executive Director.

    "content": "Mid-Shore legislators express concern over tax hikes in governor’s budget proposal\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the state facing a significant deficit, some Mid-Shore legislators are raising concerns that the governor's proposed budget may negatively impact local constituents and businesses.In his fiscal year 2026 budget proposal presented Wednesday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) suggested both tax cuts and increases, as well as spending cuts, to tackle the state's looming $3 billion budget gap.\nMoore's proposal lays out two new tax brackets for high-income households: a 6.25% rate for those who make more than $500,000 and a 6.5% rate for those who make more than $1 million.\nMeanwhile, it consolidates the state's bottom four tax brackets and doubles the standard deduction on tax returns, two measures expected to provide tax breaks to Marylanders, Moore says. The governor plans to reduce corporate taxes \"to entice more businesses and drive growth.\"\nBut local legislators aren't fully on board with Moore's plans to offset the deficit. Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) shared his reaction after watching Moore's live press conference on Wednesday.\n\"My initial reaction was a little jaw-dropping,\" Hutchinson said. \"I felt like it was a little bit of smoke and mirrors on the way that he was presenting the budget.\"\nHutchinson says while lower corporate taxes look \"nice on the surface,\" he's most concerned for local small businesses with the new tax brackets.\n\"That's where it's really going to hurt the small business owners because they pass through a lot of their small businesses through their personal income taxes,\" Hutchinson said. \"So it's going to be detrimental, actually, to small businesses in my opinion.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) noted Moore's proposal to eliminate the inheritance tax as a positive. However, she's worried some of the spending reductions will burden counties, such as the expectation that counties will supplement proposed state reductions in teacher retirement funding.\nHutchinson and Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) both likened Moore's tax hikes for the wealthy to tax increases seen under former Gov. Martin O'Malley (D).\nSample-Hughes and Ghrist are worried the tax increases will drive Marylanders elsewhere, specifically the \"half-millionaires\" and above.\n\"One of my fears is is that if we continually tax the upper bracket, they're going to … move to Delaware or move to other neighboring states,\" Sample-Hughes said.\n\"The folks who have the money, they reinvest in the economy with their wealth,\" Ghrist said. \" … We're just shooting ourselves in the foot is what we're doing. It's terrible economic policy.\"\nHutchinson is optimistic the tax cuts in the lower brackets may help local residents, but he shares the other legislators' worries about the increases for wealthy residents.\n\"I think a lot of the local residents on the Shore will have a positive effect on the change to the lower tax bracket,\" Hutchinson said. \"But my fear is sometimes we rob Peter to pay Paul. While we'll all stay because we love it and we want to be here, again, those high-income earners have the opportunity to go multiple places when there's a tax increase on their personal income tax.\"\nMOVING FORWARDSince the Democrats have a firm majority in the legislature, some Republicans understand that there's limited ability to push forward their spending and tax policies.\n\"There's really not much we can do. We're outnumbered two to one,\" Ghrist said. \"The only thing we can do is inform the public about what's going on, inform the public about what these impacts are going to be.\"\nGhrist believes it will \"be an ugly session for taxpayers.\"\nHe and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) say a better way to address the budget gap would be to find savings in government efficiency efforts.\n\"I look for things that are consensus ideas,\" Mautz said. He believes this year's budget will undergo more scrutiny than recent ones and potentially see \"significant changes\" during the legislative session.\nHutchinson says Republicans will be \"very vocal,\" adding that some of his Democratic colleagues have their own concerns about the budget proposal.\n\"What was laid out on Wednesday — I am sure — is not going to be the final version that we see when we move forward in early April,\" Hutchinson said. \"And we will be having a lot of debates over this issue. It is the number one issue.\"\nSample-Hughes said it's important for legislators to comb through ways in which government agency cuts can help reduce the budget gap. She wants to see that diligent work done before counties assume any more of the burden.\nAs for tax increases on Marylanders, Sample-Hughes is hoping that can be avoided given the current economic landscape.\n\"That's not something I'm supportive of because I know that the constituency is already grappling with a lot of financial burdens,\" Sample-Hughes said.\nA final version of the state's 2026 budget must be passed by both chambers of the Maryland legislature before the end of this year's General Assembly in April. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One transferred to North Caroline. One is injured. Two decided not to come out. We lost some guys we were going to be counting on as part of our season, so we're filling in.\"\nOne of those filling in for Colonel, 120-pounder Elisee Pierre-Louis, won by injury default. Pierre-Louis was taking Otto Perez to the mat, when the Easton freshman injured his arm while trying to brace his fall. Perez was taken by ambulance to have the injury treated.\n\"That was a momentum punch in the gut for the guys,\" Easton head coach Jason Biringer said of losing Perez.\nEaston (0-3) had built an early 12-0 lead on Skye Matthews' forfeit win at 106, and Esteban Velasquez' 1:59 pinfall over Brody Omohundro at 113.\nThe injury default cut Easton's lead in half, but Colonel (2-2) won the next three matches. Jayquan Wilkins crafted a 17-2 technical fall over John Seymour at 126, pulling Colonel within 12-11. Zy Nichols (132) and Evan Alexander (138) each won by forfeit, pushing the Colonels' lead to 23-12.\nThe Warriors stopped that streak when Adonis Schmidt pinned Trynton Parks in 59 seconds of the 144-pound match, drawing the visitors within 23-18.\nBut Colonel Richardson won six of the final seven matches, scoring bonus points in five of the bouts.\nAnthony Alexander (150) started Colonel's roll, pinning Matthew Bravo just as the first-period buzzer sounded. Gary Koeneman (157) followed, working a 19-4 technical fall over Vlad Oslam. Colonel's Ethan Thomas then got turned to his back, yet rolled through on the way to a 2:47 pinfall over Darren Foxwell at 165, stretching the Colonel lead to 40-18.\n\"They wrestled amazing,\" Hall said of his team. \"We've been shocked by Ethan Thomas. He's a freshman, just started wrestling last year in a middle school club. He's wrestling up a weight class and has been huge.\n\"Other guys we expected to win, won,\" Hall continued. \"Other guys we're expecting to go out there and wrestle hard, are. It's been a good season so far.\"\nTony Melendez got Easton back in the win column with a 1:07 fall over freshman Brox Meissner at 175. But the Colonels closed the match, with Richard Taylor (190) pinning Wahaab Popal in 2:15, Wilson Clough (215) winning by forfeit, and Chatydrick Pickrom (285) pinning Matthew Brunner in 2:45.\nStill, Biringer was encouraged by what he saw.\n\"We are seeing some better habits,\" Biringer said. \"We're also seeing some self-destructive moves, where it's, 'Don't make up your own moves. Do the moves you're taught.' Usually when something bad was happening they were trying something that wasn't a fundamental move. So it's beginner's mistakes, but at the same time a lot more effort, and progress is being made.\"\nColonel's girls earned 39-22 victory in what was Easton's first girls dual meet. Each team won two of the four matches wrestled.\nColonel's Luna Infante-Reyes (115) pinned Leah Gonzalez-Reyes in 3:38, and Estelle Lima (190) earned a 7-0 decision over Khadija Popal.\nEaston's wins came from Shiza Gondal (135), who pinned Lizzy Hesson, and Thanh Mai Pham (140), who earned a 10-2 major decision over Aiyanna Groce. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One weapon in this armoury of attack is the five card weak two-bid. It isn't my style, but it does have its moments, like in today's deal.North expected a six-card suit opposite.Against four hearts doubled, West led the diamond ace: five, three, four. He continued with three rounds of hearts to stop a diamond ruff in the dummy.To make the contract, South had to establish a spade for a diamond discard, and he had to find the club queen. He played a spade to dummy's king, cashed the ace and ruffed a spade in hand.Declarer judged that West had three diamond honours because East hadn't played a higher diamond at trick one. Along with the heart ace-king and spade queen, that made at least 17 points.Clearly East, not West, had the club queen. However, South had to be careful.He led the club seven to dummy's king. Next came the club jack. East didn't cover, so the jack won the trick. Now followed a spade ruff, the club ace, a club to dummy's 10 and the fifth spade for a diamond discard.Well played!If East had covered the club jack, declarer would have won with his ace and played the club nine to dummy's 10. Then, after a spade ruff, the carefully preserved club two would have been led to dummy's four to allow the discard on the spade 10.Finally, note that the opening lead of the heart eight will defeat the contract - but would anyone find that?©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the first and second were wanted by him, the latest forced him to change his perspective quickly upon joining his fourth NHL organization.\n\"I don't think there's any time for anybody to feel sorry about themselves,\" Dubois said on a video call with reporters Wednesday, one year short of the anniversary of signing his current contract. \"You learn in the hockey world teams will do what they think is better for their team, and there's no hard feelings. For me, I could take it multiple ways, but I'm choosing to take it as extra motivation and to just get myself ready for next season.\"\nDubois acknowledged he probably did not need more motivation after putting up just 40 points, the lowest of his career in a full, 82-game season. Kings general manager Rob Blake took responsibility for Dubois not being put in the right roles and the situation not being a great fit.\nThe trade gives Dubois, picked third by Columbus in the 2016 draft and traded to Winnipeg five years later for Patrik Laine and Jack Roslovic, another fresh start. Dubois is the Capitals' latest reclamation project, two summers after signing another center who was a No. 3 pick and already on his second team.\nThat one worked out swimmingly, with Dylan Strome establishing himself as an important part of Washington's evolving core in the final years of the Alex Ovechkin era. Strome and Dubois were actually roommates when they played together on Canada's world junior team in 2017.\n\"I'm sure that we'll push each other, and he'll teach me what he's learned already,\" Dubois said. \"To be able to play with him again will be really fun and get to know him again. Obviously, we're in different stages in life, but it'll be exciting.\"\nDubois is at the stage of trying to get back on track. On three previous occasions he scored 27 or more goals in a season, and GM Brian MacLellan when acquiring him said Dubois had immense potential to be a top-tier player because of his size, skating and hockey IQ — in part because he's expected to have a bigger role than in L.A.\n\"It was exactly what you want to hear as a player: How excited they are, how I can help in a lot of ways for this team,\" Dubois said of his first conversation with MacLellan. \"You want to feel welcome. You want to feel like you're a part of it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I think that people will be very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the films that they're going to be watching.\"\nThe festival will feature 58 short films spanning many genres, including horror, drama, comedy, documentaries and art-house films. Filmmakers are coming from all over the United States and from as far away as Germany.\n\"Just hearing the stories and what people went through just to tell something that they felt was really important to them at that time, that separates us from what studio films are all made for,\" Tauginas said. \"They're all profit-driven. Indies are a lot of times just driven by the heart.\"\nThere are also a number of films that were shot right here in Delaware, including \"Return to Hockessin No. 107C,\" which is about the history of the Hockessin Colored School, and \"Unseen American Dream,\" a documentary about a blind couple from Wilmington raising sighted children.\n\"Delaware locals have their own category at my festival,\" Tauginas said. \"And then, of course, we have filmmakers from Los Angeles and New York and everywhere in between.\"\nTauginas is an actor, director and writer who has written and starred in more than 20 independent films. His acting career also has included guest spots in major television shows, and he has appeared in several movies, including \"The Equalizer 2,\" starring Denzel Washington.\nHe lives in Newark and also works as a real estate agent and serves on the Newark Planning Commission.\nThe film festival will include the premier of the feature film \"Mirror Life,\" which Tauginas wrote, directed and starred in. The movie is about a woman who's searching for her cousin who disappeared after entering an illegal human clinical trial.\nTauginas said that major film studios are moving more and more of their productions overseas, leading to fewer opportunities for actors here. That's part of what inspired him to start the film festival, to provide an opportunity to showcase more independent films.\n\"Filmmakers are going to be able to see their film on screen, in front of an audience, on the big screen with a dynamic sound system in a proper venue, so that it can get the attention that it deserves,\" he said. \"I think it's a really important thing, especially for independent artists.\"\nHe added that he hopes the festival is an economic boost for Newark as the filmmakers from out of town arrive in Newark, stay at the Hyatt Place hotel on Main Street and patronize local restaurants and shops.\nTauginas, who used to own the Korner Diner on Main Street, said he knows that the summer is a slow time for Newark businesses. With a location right off Interstate 95 and a walkable downtown, Newark is a great place for the festival, he said.\n\"I can't think of a better place that you would want a film festival,\" he said.\nThe Newark Independent Film Festival will show 58 films in seven blocks spread over three days. Tickets for each block are $15.

I got interested in politics when I was involved with Medical Freedom for Talbot County.\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 2 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nRunning for Ward 2 is an honor. I am running because we need a voice for the day-to-day people who live in Easton. The hardworking backbone of our society. Your neighbors, servers, police, grocery store workers, those struggling on social security, etc. I see and hear the struggles.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nI will prioritize the accountability of the Town Council, transparency and accountability with \"your\" money, smart growth for our special town.\nWe need to keep our next generation. People with and without children are from moving away from the Shore because they can't afford to live here and raise a family.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThe town budget is not transparent enough. We need to see more details instead of just line items with no explanations. It's hard to see exactly where our money is going.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nIt is funny the Census has Easton population growth of only 101 more people since 2020. We all can see there has been much more growth. Either that or are we just congested because of workers commuting who live in more affordable towns.We need starter home neighborhoods for the first responders, teachers and people not making six figures. We can think outside the box — barndominiums, tiny homes or prefab housing neighborhoods, which are much less expensive to build.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nSafety is key for everyone in Easton. We need to treat our neighbors with kindness. Introduce yourself and watch out for each other. We have exceptional first responders, including police, EMS and volunteer firefighters, working a tough job just out of their heart for the people of their community. They are doing a great job even though they are running with short manpower.\nWith the area growing, we need to make sure we keep them equipped with proper needs.\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI love the Ward 2 area where I live and volunteer. The Rails to Trails is a huge part of linking neighborhoods to the downtown area. Keeping that a positive and safe trail is always a concern for everyone.\nAlso, Idlewild Park is the most used park in Easton, so we need to keep it updated for everyone. The play area needs some attention, and why not do a pickleball court, since its popularity has grown 52% since 2019?\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

These four sixth graders earned their Bronze Award for Girl Scouts by setting their sights on helping the cats and dogs at the shelter.To earn their Bronze Awards, the girls from Troop 899 in Centreville had to complete 20 hours of service in a service project. Sharing a love for animals, it was easy to decide that the project would help animals in need. Claire's mom shared that Claire has been visiting animal shelters for years with her grandfather to spend time cuddling the animals after school.This past summer, the girls toured the facility to learn about what the shelter did and what it needed. From June to September, the girls worked independently and as a team to meet these needs. After reaching out and doing research, the girls learned the ACSKC had recently moved into a new building and had many needs.These needs included: a new cat tree, cat and dog toys, pet food and treats, new storage benches, and cleaning items. The girls explained the shelter had to throw out a beautiful, carpeted cat tree due to a sickness that had hit the shelter. The girls quickly began their mission to make a cat tree that was easy to clean and maintain.During these 20 hours or more of time, the girls strategized in meetings (in person and on Zoom) on how to meet these needs and then worked together to create and build the items needed. The cat tree was thoughtfully made, and with a little help from their parents, the girls found a plan that would use easy-to-clean PVC pipes. After making sure the pipes fit, they glued them together and painted them gold. The girls also made Velcro patches of fabric from reused clothing. \"These fabric patches were made from my grandpa's old jackets and now they can be velcroed off and on for easy washing\" explained Amelia.Shelter worker, Paige Tucker, said they currently have 109 dogs and cats at the animal shelter. Right now, there are 32 animals in need of homes. Allison Otadan, Shelter Media Coordinator, shared the shelter is \"so grateful for the efforts of the girls\" for the new cat trees and other pet items. She is excited for the new benches, as the current benches are all scratched up. At this shelter, there are special rooms for the animals to freely roam, but that also causes some of the items to get worn down and scratched. In addition to the cat tree and wooden benches, the girls sewed catnip toys, hand tied snuffle mats (where pet treats can be hidden and found), and collected lots of donations from their whole troop, grades kindergarten through fifth grade.If you would also like to help the shelter, they are currently in need of kitten food, cat food, dog food, and cat/dog treats. There is a complete Wish List on their website that includes the specific brands needed at https://acskc.org/ \n \n Caption: TAMARA FORTE\n \nThe girls get to play with the cats that need homes at the shelter. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore for treatment of life-threatening injuries. He died on Wednesday afternoon, his family said on Facebook Thursday.\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Darren's father, Len Foxwell, wrote that the family is \"eternally grateful for everyone who has sent their love and support, for those who have stepped up with profound gestures of support, and for Darren's friends who drove here from Easton yesterday to say goodbye to their childhood buddy.\"\n\"Each of you have been a lifeline and have honored Darren in your own special way,\" Len Foxwell wrote.\nHis father added that the team at Shock Trauma in Baltimore \"fought like a tiger to keep Darren comfortable, preserve his dignity and provide solace for a family that has been destroyed.\"\nA member of Easton High School's wrestling and lacrosse teams, Foxwell graduated last month. He planned to attend Bethany College in West Virginia this fall and play lacrosse for the Bison.\nFoxwell played the last two years for Easton as a backup defenseman. Easton High boys head lacrosse coach Dennis Keenan said he was popular among his teammates and had a \"bright future.\"\n\"I think he was funnier than he actually thought he was,\" Keenan said. \"The things he would say would just crack me up. He was getting better each day. You could see flashes of brilliance.\"\nFoxwell wrestled for three years at Easton, including under head coach Jason Biringer during his senior year. Biringer said Foxwell had an \"infectious\" personality.\nEarly this past season, Foxwell stepped away from the wrestling team. But after speaking with his coach, he returned and started at the 167-pound weight class for the Warriors.\nAfter returning to the team, Biringer made Foxwell a team captain because of Foxwell's work ethic and focus.\n\"The other wrestlers looked up to him,\" Biringer said. \"He has such a good, gentle demeanor that he was just very well liked.\"\n\"He just had one of those infectious smiles that you're like, 'It's always good to see Darren,'\" Biringer added.\nFamily said on Thursday that arrangements for funeral services and a celebration of life are being made and will be announced soon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Warriors survive Bulldogs' rally\n\n September 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It didn't matter that North Caroline High's football team had lost its first two games this season.The Bulldogs just scared Easton head coach Matt Griffith. And in a furious fourth-quarter span of just over four minutes they showed why, shaving a 28-point Warrior lead to just seven.\nThat's when Mikey O'Connor took over. Easton's senior quarterback ran for a pair of first downs and threw for another in the final 2:52 Friday night to finally secure a 28-21 victory that pushed the Warriors' record to 3-0.\n\"They got great athletes all over the field,\" Griffith said of North Caroline. \"They've struggled early on, but you saw exactly how explosive they can be, and how quick they can be explosive. That's what I was worried about. Sometimes you can do all the right things, but sometimes really good athletes can make plays. And that's a lot of what happened in the last five minutes of the twilight zone that we're calling it.\"\nO'Connor hit Diontaye Copper for a 35-yard touchdown pass 1:41 into the third quarter, and Dominic Stanco tacked on the point-after kick for a 28-0 Easton lead.\nThe Warriors had not allowed a point all season until North Caroline's Tyson Weber scored on a 16-yard run with just under seven minutes left in the game, drawing the Bulldogs (0-3) within 28-7. Mason Shilling added the extra point.\nEaston went three-and-out on its next possession, with O'Connor booting a quick kick to North Caroline's 27. Bulldog senior quarterback Corey Bunce hit Derek Jones for 13 yards, then connected with Zymear Smith for a 33-yard pickup. Weber scored on a 27-yard touchdown run on the next play and Shilling again converted the PAT, narrowing Easton's lead to 28-14 with 3:57 left.\nNorth Caroline recovered the ensuing onsides kick at the Warrior 47. Bunce hit Jones for a 20-yard gain. Easton's Tymiere Thomas sacked Bunce for a 5-yard loss. But the Bulldogs' quarterback fired toward the end zone on the next play, and watched the ball deflect into the hands of Jones for a 33-yard touchdown. Shilling's point-after kick made it 28-21 with 2:52 remaining.\n\"Hell of a comeback,\" North Caroline head coach Nic McMorris said. \"I'm so proud of the resilience of our guys. It was the first time that we recognized this team.\n\"They're a great team,\" McMorris added of Easton. \"They have such a dynamic offense. But we were moving the ball and just kept shooting ourselves in the foot. And then we just started playing inspired football.\"\nNorth Caroline drove from its 38 to the Easton 12 when it fumbled the ball away late in the first quarter. But the Bulldogs regained possession four plays later when O'Connor's pass was deflected and intercepted by Smith. Again Caroline moved the ball, marching 32 yards to the Warrior 8. But the Bulldogs again fumbled, with Easton recovering at the 1.\nEaston's next drive ended with a fumble, giving North Caroline possession at the Warrior 25. But North Caroline went no where on three plays. Shilling came on to attempt a 40-yard field goal, but slipped on his approach, the kick falling well short.\nThe Warriors, who took a 7-0 lead on O'Connor's 3-yard touchdown run and Stanco's PAT with 3:54 left in the first quarter, stretched their lead to 14-0 with 2:11 left in the first half, when Jordan Horsey slammed in from five yards out. Stanco again made the extra point.\nEaston took advantage of a short Caroline punt, as O'Connor hit Carter Mooney for 18 yards, and Copper for 17 yards before scoring on a 2-yard run for a 21-0 halftime lead.\n\"We came out with a game plan and we executed very well,\" Griffith said. \"I think we did a lot of really good things early, even with two turnovers. Those are our first two turnovers of the year. We were able to bounce back.\"\nSo was North Caroline.\n\"No excuses,\" Griffith said. \"Caroline's a good football team. They're a very good football team for being 0-3.\"\nIt's one-time 28-point cushion reduced to just seven, Dustin Blue recovered the onsides kick for Easton after North Caroline had gotten within 28-21.\nO'Connor ran for three yards before Caroline called time. O'Connor then ran for eight yards and a first down. North Caroline stuffed Easton's quarterback for no gain on the next play and again burned a timeout. O'Connor then fired an 11-yard dart to Carter Mooney for a first down, then found room around left end for a 22-yard pickup and a first down that clinched the win. O'Connor took a knee on the next two plays to bleed the final minute.\n'We got up and then we just kind of let off,\" O'Connor said. \"And we just can't do that against a great team like this. Great first half. Then the second half we slipped off. But we need to play two halves of football.\"\nGriffith agreed but applauded his quarterback.\n\"He did a phenomenal job,\" Griffith said of O'Connor. \"And he took control at the end of the game to make sure we were able to seal the victory.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County Council passes property registration, accessory structure bills\n\n March 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 396\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Dorchester County Council passed two housing-related bills at its meeting on March 5.The first bill establishes property registrations for vacant buildings, short-term rentals and rental units. These properties and units would need to be registered with the county annually.\nShort-term rentals are defined as properties that are rented for more than 15 days and less than 30 days.\nAt a council meeting Feb. 6, County Planning and Zoning Director Susan Webb said the intent of creating these three different registrations is life safety and property maintenance.\nShe said with these registrations, the county would be able to contact property managers and owners in case of an emergency. Webb also said that the registrations would keep property owners accountable when it comes to property maintenance and following county codes and regulations.\nThe second bill the County Council passed on March 5 amends the zoning chapter of the county code to lessen restrictions on residential accessory structures.\nThe amendment makes it so that, for lot size of up to 1.99 acres, a residential accessory structure can't exceed 200% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nFor a lot size of two acres to 4.99 acres, a residential accessory structure can't exceed 300% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nFor a lot size of five acres or more, a residential accessory structure can't exceed 500% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nBefore this bill was passed, for suburban residential, suburban residential-RCA, rural residential and rural residential-RCA zoning districts, the sum total of residential accessory structures on a property couldn't exceed the building footprint of the principal residential structure or 1,200 square feet, whichever is greater, without a special exception by the Board of Appeals.\nFor agricultural conservation, agricultural conservation-RCA, resource conservation, resource conservation-RCA and rural residential-conservation zoning districts, the sum total of residential accessory structures on a property couldn't exceed the building footprint of the principal residential structure or 1,600 square feet, whichever is greater, without a special exception by the Board of Appeals.\nAt the Feb. 6 council meeting, Webb said the amendment would provide relief to both property owners and county staff. She said 75% of the county's Board of Appeals cases in the past two years have been for accessory structures that are greater than what is allowed by county code, which has incurred more legal fees for the county and made meetings longer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland couple celebrates 70th wedding anniversary\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jane Bellmyer jbellmyer@ceciwlhig.com | Section: News \n \n 645\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Wayne Smythe and Joan Bines got married 70 years ago today, Dwight David Eisenhower was president, On the Waterfront was big at the box office, Sh-Boom by The Crew Cuts was the hot song on the radio and the first Jonas Salk polio vaccines were being administered.He was 20 and she was 16 when they stood before The Rev. Jack Patterson at Hopewell United Methodist Church in Port Deposit and got married.\n\"My father was strict,\" Joan recalled. \"I wasn't allowed past the sidewalk after 8 p.m.\"\nSo the young couple eloped June 14, 1954. They had been dating about a year.\n\"I met him through his cousin,\" Joan said. \"I think we clicked right away.\" Dating meant driving around, talking and going out to dinner.\n\"We'd go to the one (restaurant) in North East and one in Chesapeake City,\" Wayne recalled.\n\"The one in North East you could sit and watch them cook through the window,\" Joan added.\nThen came 'The Day.'\n\"I proposed to him,\" Joan said. It was one of several days she had ditched school to hang out with Wayne.\n\"I was just being silly. I asked if he'd marry me. He said, 'yeah,'\" Joan said, adding, \"I wasn't expecting that.\"\nFor the wedding, Joan wore a dress from her own closet.\n\"I snuck off wearing a dress I already had,\" she said. \"It was a purple dress with a black bolero and black suede shoes.\"\nShe also wore a white corsage; a gift from Wayne.\nWayne wore his uniform. He was in the US Air Force from 1953 to 1957. Trained as an aircraft mechanic during the Korean War, he spent 15 months in the Philippines and also served in the Formosa Islands, among other stops.\n\"It was good to see what other people lived like,\" Wayne said of his service years. \"They didn't like the U.S. and they still don't.\"\nAfter a short honeymoon in the Poconos, the couple lived with her cousins — Gert and Frankie Bines — for a time before buying their first home.\n\"We found a little house on Richmond Street (in Perryville) for $4,000,\" Wayne said. \"When we had that house we used to have all the kids over with big dinners.\"\nThose five kids led to 12 grandchildren and now 26 great grandchildren. Big family dinners are a thing of the past.\nExcept for the house Wayne built in Port Deposit near Burlin Road, the couple has always lived in Perryville.\nFrom Port Deposit, they moved into Joan's parents' house for 43 years, then into a smaller rancher about 15 years ago.\n\"This has everything on one floor,\" Joan noted.\nThe secret of their success\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, more than 30% of first marriages end in divorce.\nSo how have the Smythes made it to 70 years?\n\"No arguments over money,\" Wayne said simply. \"Money is what breaks a lot of people up. I brought home all the paychecks to her.\"\n\"With a large item to buy, we'd discuss it,\" he added.\nJoan worked until she had their first child, Joanne, when she was 18. After Wayne Jr, Douglas, Michelle and Jennifer were old enough, she went back to work while Wayne worked as many as four jobs. That included his own oil burner service company.\n\"I raised a bunch of kids. He worked all the time,\" she said. \"It has paid off.\"\nHe did have some fun in between all those working hours.\n\"He bought an old bakery truck and turned it into a camper,\" Joan said, remembering all those fun trips as a family.\n\"I used to have classic cars,\" Wayne added. The one he admits to missing the most is a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette. \"I also had a Ford Coupe, a Mercury and a Thunderbird.\"\nNow as they approach their Platinum Anniversary, Wayne looked back and commented he was \"just a plain country boy\" when he and Joan got married, and they have had a good marriage.\n\"I have no regrets in my life,\" Wayne said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was 95.\"There are simply not many careers that can compare to Betsy's,\" said Mike Whan, the CEO of the USGA and former LPGA Tour commissioner.He cited her 55 wins and eight majors - Rawls ranks sixth on both lists - along with her induction into the LPGA and World Golf Hall of Fame, the Bob Jones Award and her 17 years as tournament director of what was then the LPGA Championship.\"She was a legend in the game who would have been successful in anything she pursued, so we are all lucky she made golf her passion,\"Whan said.The intention was always in the field of physics. That's what Rawls was studying at the University ofTexas when she connected with fabled swing coach Harvey Penick. She won the Texas Women's Amateur in 1949 and 1950, and she finished runner-up to Babe Zaharias in the 1950 U.S. Women's Open.\"I had every intention of being a physicist,\" Rawls said in a story posted on the LPGA's website. \"I played golf for fun and never considered turning professional. Then I decided it would be more fun to be in golf than physics, and Wilson paid me a salary and all my expenses. They paid my expenses for 20 years. One year, I gave 120 clinics.\"She won the U.S. Women's Open by five shots over Louise Suggs in 1951, the first of four titles in the biggest event in women's golf. Only the late Mickey Wright won as many Opens.Wright once said, \"Betsy has always been committed to work and dedicated to the game. I can think of only two women who have achieved as much, not only as players but for their lifetime contributions, and that's Betsy and Patty Berg.\" Rawls was born May 4, 1928, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, though she moved to Texas in 1940 and grew up mostly in Arlington.She won at least once a year from 1951 through 1965. She won the last of her eight majors at age 41 in the 1969 LPGA Championship by four shots.Rawls led the LPGA Tour money list in 1952 and 1959. She won the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average in 1959 and led the LPGA in victories three times.She was part of the inaugural class for the LPGA Hall of Fame in 1967 and in 1996 received the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor by the USGA. She became the first woman to work the men's U.S. Open as a rules official in 1980.She also was the LPGA president in 1961 and 1962, and after retiring from full-time competition in 1975, she worked a tournament director and later ran the LPGA Championship.\"Anyone who can make a living in golf is lucky,\" Rawls once said. \"Then to receive all the benefits accorded to me in the process well, that makes me feel fortunate. It's more than I could possibly deserve.\" \n \n Caption: ASSOClATED PRESS\n \nBetsy Rawls smiles after charging from behind with a final round to win the $36,000 Ladies Professional Golfers' Association's tournament at Kiamesha Lake, N.γ., July 28, 1969. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gorbachev signed a treaty at the White House calling for destruction of intermediate-range nuclear missiles.In 1991, AIDS patient Kimberly Bergalis, who had contracted the disease from her dentist, died in Fort Pierce, Florida, at age 23.In 2001, the U.S. Capitol was reopened to tourists after a two-month security shutdown.In 2008, in a startling about-face, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal he would confess to masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks; four other men also abandoned their defenses.In 2011, the 161-day NBA lockout ended when owners and players ratified the new collective bargaining agreement.In 2014, the U.S. and NATO ceremonially ended their combat mission in Afghanistan, 13 years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks sparked their invasion of the country to topple the Taliban-led government.In 2016, John Glenn, whose 1962 flight as the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth made him an all-American hero and propelled him to a long career in the U.S. Senate, died in Columbus, Ohio, at age 95.In 2012, Texas A & M quarterback Johnny Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy.In 2022, Russia freed WNBA star Brittney Griner in a high-profile prisoner exchange with the U.S., which released Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, he even requested to see the bottle complete with the label.But wines from Maryland in general, and Southern Maryland in particular, have come a long way since then.\n\"I think our reputation has definitely improved,\" Zimmerman said during a lecture titled \"Port of Leonardtown Winery, and the History of Wine in Maryland\" held May 21 at Historic Sotterley. \"I think people and their wineries experience has improved. There's also a lot of experienced winemakers coming into the area, which has improved the quality of Maryland wines immensely.\"\nThe Leonardtown winery is celebrating its 15th season this year and has won numerous wine industry awards.\n\"We're very well known for producing wines in general, dry and sweet,\" Zimmerman said.\nThe lecture also featured wine tastings of a limited edition sparkling red the winery will release in June.\n\"It is a dry red sparkling and it's loaded with red berry flavors,\" Zimmerman said of the wine, the label of which was designed by local artist Bernard Matus. \"It has lots of notes of blueberry, raspberry. I think it's going to fly off the shelves.\"\nThe lecture also included Southern Maryland Grape Grower's Cooperative President David Wood, who is also owner of Forest Hall Farm Market in Mechanicsville.\n\"We needed a viable alternative. Nobody's going to create a market just for grape juice,\" Wood said of the winery's beginnings in 2007. \"Just like anything else that is new, you learn as you grow. The money's not in the grapes, the money is in the profit of the wine.\"\nBut Wood added it wasn't easy for former tobacco farmers to start growing grapes.\n\"You weren't prepared to do the marketing, to go out and shop your crop to find a buyer who was willing to buy it,\" he said. \"That's not a farmer's strength; they're used to staying at home and dealing with their crops. The selling of the crop was the big issue and the co-op stepped up and provided a solution to that challenge.\"\nWith the start of the wine co-op in 2007 — the first in the state — farmers still faced hurdles before seeing the literal fruits of their labors.\n\"The [profit] net was pretty good because tobacco was labor-intensive; it didn't require a lot of investment,\" Wood said. \"Grapes on the other hand are costly and it takes about three years of growing the grapes before you get your first harvest.\"\nWood said wineries require an investment of about $10,000 an acre \"before you get your first crop, and you probably won't break even until your fifth or sixth harvest.\"\nBut he added growers will \"probably get 20, 25 years of harvests, so once you get over the hump, you can really get ahead.\"\nThe Port of Leonardtown Winery had its first crush of grapes in 2009 and opened a year later.\nWood added that a single winery can usually offer the basic red and white varieties, but having a co-op means a selection of 20 labels or more.\n\"It gives us not only more grapes, but a wider variety,\" he said. \"It turns into a product mix of more unique wines.\"\nZimmerman said Port of Leonardtown produces about 5,000 cases annually, and that red and white grapes are treated differently; reds get a mix of seeds and skin where it gets its flavor and color, while whites are made with whole cluster pressing.\nAll reds are aged in an oak barrel, while all white grapes are aged in a stainless steel drum.\n\"Chardonnay made in stainless steel barrels have crisp, clean like green apple flavor,\" she said, \"versus chardonnays in made in oak barrels have a baked apple, vanilla cinnamon-spiced, clove flavor. They're different styles, but just both beautiful wines.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The tale gives Adam West a big chunk of time as Batman's alias Bruce Wayne.\"The Jetsons\" (MeTV, Sunday, Aug. 13): A series about the future - even an animated one - would have to consider the computer age to be even mildly accurate, and the first-season episode \"Uniblab\" sees George Jetson's (voice of George O'Hanlon) career placed in jeopardy by a machine that seems capable of performing all of the same functions, without the requirement of a paycheck.\"Face/Off\" (AMC, Tuesday, Aug. 15): Director John Woo's 1997 melodrama has a great conceit, with an FBI agent (John Travolta) very reluctantly - and very literally - surgically switching faces with a master criminal (Nicolas Cage) in a scheme to thwart a major attack being planned by the felon. As far-out as the plot might seem, there's enormous entertainment value in watching each star approximate the other, as both characters and performers.\"The Lost World\" (FXM, Saturday, Aug. 19): Before he became the movies' \"master of disaster\" with the likes of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" and \"The Towering Inferno,\" Irwin Allen made his mark as a producer-director of science fiction, one example being this 1960 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story about an expedition's discovery of prehistoric territory, The special effects are rather primitive (pun intended) by today's standards, but there's still fun to be had; stars include Michael Rennie, Jill St. John, David Hedison and Claude Rains. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Final Four beckons Bueckers and Clark\n\n April 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1167\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CLEVELAND — Their memories are blurry.Of AAU tournaments and Team USA practices. Of gold medals and deep 3s. Of the girl with the brown ponytail with the unlimited range who always seemed to know what was coming next and the blonde who never got rattled with the ball in her hands, by opponents or the sea of eyes constantly transfixed on her.\nYet ask Iowa's Caitlin Clark and UConn's Paige Bueckers their earliest impression of the other and you get generalities, light on details if heavy on respect.\nMaybe because those years shadowing each other on the travel circuit across the Midwest or teaming up for the occasional international competition seem so long ago. Maybe because in some ways — in the most meaningful of ways — they are.\nThe NCAA Tournament that Clark grew up watching in Iowa and Bueckers took in from the outskirts of Minneapolis doesn't exist anymore. Back then, the inequalities between the men's and women's versions of March Madness were massive, from facilities to swag to TV ratings, even the branding.\nIt's not that way anymore.\nNot with Clark and Iowa selling out everywhere they go. Not with Bueckers finally healthy after spending the better part of two years recovering from knee injuries that left her fearful the generational skills that made her the first freshman to win the AP Player of the Year award would never return.\nOnly they have. Just in time for the two players who have helped propel interest in the women's tournament to an all-time high to take center stage.\nWhen Clark and the top-seeded Hawkeyes face Bueckers and third-seeded UConn on Friday night in the Final Four, they'll do it not in some anonymous gym with nothing but parents, scouts and college coaches watching.\nThey will play in front of a packed arena with millions watching on television and millions more keeping track on social media, an ever-growing group that includes LeBron James and Steph Curry and Luka Doncic and aspiring ballers from all over.\nIt's not that women's basketball hasn't had stars before. It has. Just never quite as many as this who play quite like this.\nAnd while Iowa coach Lisa Bluder made it a point on Thursday to say she didn't want the national semifinal to be pitted as \"Caitlin vs. Paige,\" everyone else involved seems to be OK with the arrangement because of what it means for not just their respective teams, but the women's game in general.\n\"It's a star-driven society that we live in,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a celebrity-driven, star-driven, influencer-driven world that's been created.\"\nOne in which both Clark and Bueckers are comfortable traveling, perhaps because it's the only world they've ever known.\nBIRD VS. MAGIC 2.0? YES AND NOThe parallels to the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird that began when Johnson and Michigan State faced Bird and Indiana State in the 1979 NCAA championship are obvious.\n\"All of a sudden those two particular players came on and it just lit everything up, and it just took off from there,\" Auriemma said. \"So it needs some stars. It needs people that have the right personality, the right game. And we have that now.\"\nThing is, Bueckers and Clark don't view themselves as rivals. Not in a traditional sense. If anything, they believe they're simply riding the crest of a wave that's been building for years, long before they reached a first-name-only level of fame.\nAsk Clark why interest in women's basketball has spiked and she doesn't point to her record-setting career or her \"did she really shoot that\" range or even her team's success but simple exposure.\nTo Clark, the women's game has always been great. It's just taken a while, a long while, for the world to catch up.\n\"It's the platforms that (we're able to have now) that should have been there for a really long time,\" Clark said. \"We've had some amazing talents come through our game, over the last 10, 20 years.\"\nTalents that haven't quite connected in the way that Clark and Bueckers have connected. The easing of rules surrounding name, image and likeness compensation has allowed them to market themselves and their game in ways once unimaginable.\nFOLLOWING LEGENDSIt's a history not lost on either of them. They understand and embrace the responsibility of being a role model, knowing they were once on the other end, looking up to the likes of college and WNBA stars Maya Moore and Lindsay Whalen.\n\"They were everything that I wanted to be like,\" Bueckers said. \"And they won.\"\nA trait that has followed Bueckers seemingly from the first time she picked up a ball. It's telling that when asked about Bueckers' game, Clark didn't talk about her impeccable court vision or precise midrange jumper but what the scoreboard says after nearly every game in which she plays.\n\"She's always been dominant,\" Clark said. \"Every team that she's ever been on, she's led them to great success. It's just what she does. She's a winner.\"\nThat hasn't changed, though the dynamics around the way Clark and Bueckers are perceived have flipped over the last three years.\nROLE REVERSALIt was Bueckers, not Clark, who was the top recruit in the Class of 2020. It was Bueckers, not Clark, who was recruited by the Huskies, though Auriemma did point out this week \"if Caitlin really wanted to come to UConn, she would have called me.\" It was Bueckers, not Clark, who won that first meeting in 2021 and became the \"media darling,\" as Bueckers put it Friday.\nClark is in that position now. Setting the NCAA Division I scoring record and playing with a fearlessness that is equal parts thrilling and accessible will do that.\nSecurity people had to clear a path deep inside Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Friday to make sure she could make it from one media opportunity to the next. When UConn and Bueckers came through an hour later, the throng was half the size.\nEven for a player who says on the court she can see things before they happen, it's been a lot. The 22-year-old Clark welcomes the attention because she understands it has brought new people to her sport. Yet she's not here to be The Star, as much as people want to thrust that moniker on her.\nThree years ago, it was Bueckers. The last two years, it's been her. Next spring it might be Bueckers during her redshirt senior season. Bueckers is leaning toward this year's blockbuster freshman class, a group that includes USC's JuJu Watkins or Notre Dame's Hannah Hidalgo. A decade from now, it might be some young woman who didn't pick up a ball until she watched Clark hoist it from deep and Bueckers weave through traffic in the lane.\nIn that way, Clark doesn't see herself or Bueckers as the end result of something, but simply the latest links in a chain growing ever stronger with each passing season.\n\"It doesn't need to be one end-all, be-all (star) just like I think there doesn't need to be one end-all, be-all team,\" Clark said. \"The young talent, it's only going to get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Though the commission took effect last June 1, appointments were not completed until late October.\nThe commission also requested the ability to seek financial support mechanisms as it believes \"there may be opportunities in public health foundation-level support through grant mechanisms.\" The commission members requested the establishment of maryland.gov emails as well as the establishment of a website. The members also officially recognized the contributions of staff providing subject matter expertise and noted \"government-involved staffing helps facilitate the logistics and work of this commission.\" \"I think we all experienced the incredible challenge of the pandemic of the century in the past few years, and during that challenge recognized how incredibly strenuous the task was ahead of our public health force in particular, and the roadblocks and the gaps in public health, funding and resources really restricted our ability,\" said Dr. Meena Brewster, one of three co-chairs on the state board.\n\"We have a lot to do to be out there and be a part of this,\" said Lushniak, who added the commission has no hidden agendas and will be \"transparent.\" The next meeting will be held at 2 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 4, at the Baltimore County Department of Health.

As a member of the United States Naval Academy Class of 1968, the ceremony was particularly significant for him in losing classmates to the war.\nTo this day, remains from those missing in action continue to be identified and brought home, he said, and for some, the war never truly ended as some families are kept waiting. Sikes said he himself never heard a thank you for his service until well into the 1980s and seeks to connect the community, especially the younger generation to remember the battles fought and the sacrifices made in duty in Vietnam.\nAlongside music performed by the Centreville Middle School Symphonic Band, a pin ceremony honored all members who served in active duty anywhere in the world from 1955 to 1975.\nMarch 29 was established as National Vietnam Veterans Day in 2017 and local ceremonies are crucial in continually providing recognition to noble service members, according to Farley.\nNavy veteran in Vietnam and organizer Dave Peterson led recognition of the five Queen Anne's County residents who died in the Vietnam operating theater and their Gold Star families.\nThe ceremony's Presentation of Colors was performed by the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps Maryland Division. The National Anthem was presented by the Quee Anne's County High School Chorus.\nTaps was performed by Stephanie Shields.\nPrayer was led by Rev. Reginald Ryans.\nParticipants and sponsors also included Centreville Veterans Information Center (CVIC), Veteran and Military Support Alliance (VAMSA), American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 and Compass Regional Hospice. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had a whole HBO sitcom, \"Avenue 5,\" come and go since 2019, when his beloved, award-winning political comedy \"Veep\" ended.If you didn't know that, it's likely because \"Avenue 5,\" a sci-ficomedy about a space cruise ship that gets stuck far from Earth, never really found an audience.Its first-season ratings, in early 2020, were poor, and then the pandemic happened, which meant the second season didn't air for another two and a half years. By then, any momentum it had was lost, as reflected in the even lower Season 2 numbers.Sadly, it seems like maybe that experience has soured Iannucci on TV for a while. He's currently focused on the stage, namely a live-theatre adaptation of the classic film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (1964).Even worse for TV fans: It's being staged across an ocean in Iannucci's native Britain.\"Dr. Strangelove\" offered a cutting satire of government war-making when it was released in the midst of the Cold War, but Iannucci told the BBC that its message is just as relevant today.As for why he chose the stage instead of the screen, the ever-topical Iannucci said it was also about timing and current affairs. \"In the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting. That's what excites me about actually doing it as a live stage show.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It included two days off in the second week of March 2026 for students and a five-day spring break for students from April 2 to April 6, 2026.\n\"The thinking of the committee was to put some days off in March, and then to do the April holiday,\" Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, said. \"Dividing the break would also minimize the impact on our students who rely on the support of our schools for their meal support.\"\nBoard President Emily Jackson, who serves on the calendar committee, expressed confusion with the draft calendar that Einhorn presented.\n\"It was a surprisingly contentious group, with a huge set of ideas that ran the gamut,\" Jackson said of the committee. \"So what I am seeing presented today, to me, does not accurately reflect what I took away from the discussions that were had.\"\nJackson said she was expecting multiple draft calendars, not just one. She added that past surveys have indicated there are strong opinions on extending spring break and having \"time for teachers in their classrooms without students.\"\n\"Personally, I come back to wanting to give our community what they're asking for,\" Jackson said. \"So I'm looking for a calendar that has an actual spring break on it.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said she liked the two days off in March.\n\"I think the March break is wonderful from a mental health standpoint, because March is long, dreary,\" Bridges said. \"And everybody — kids, parents and teachers — need a little break, and I think that's a really good thing to do.\"\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry raised concerns that the shorter spring break could increase chronic absenteeism in April. Vice President Amy Dodson said while the draft calendar \"looks good,\" an off day in March could possibly be moved to extend spring break.\nJackson also brought up the possibility of staggered starts for students in \"transition\" grades that are starting at new schools. Einhorn said that she is waiting on direction from the state to understand how other districts do staggered starts while still complying with 180-day requirements.\nFeedback from Wednesday's meeting will be taken back to the calendar committee and discussed before a draft calendar is presented for second reader at the board's January meeting.\nEinhorn said it'd be possible for the committee to look at keeping the two off days in March, as well as extending spring break, by moving the last day of school back.\nJackson vouched for \"consistent breaks\" in order to accommodate student needs surrounding mental health, travel needs, college tours and more.\n\"There are ways to put this together that do make sense and don't look like this,\" the board president said.\n\"I think we have to put everything out on the table because we have constraints,\" Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said. \"We can't have it both ways.\n\"And while I know we want extra days off, I hear loud and clear from parents (about) child care. But we also want to balance, because I also hear from staff, more planning time. We just have to find out, what is that balance?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This newspaper has been critical of Leonard and his leadership of the Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.\nHis actions as the executive director have rung up more than $200,000 in unbudgeted legal expenses and driven an excellent city manager from Cambridge.\nThis week, corporation board President Angie Hengst announced that Leonard was leaving as CWDI executive director effective immediately. No reason was given, other than to say the decision was mutual.\nAccording to Hengst, the board decision was unanimous and the board members and Leonard signed an agreement on Thursday.\nHengst said \"moving forward it was best for both parties.\" Hengst would not elaborate on why it was best for both parties.\nLeonard was hired as CWDI's executive director in January 2022. In the last year, Leonard and CWDI have been in the spotlight. The Cambridge Harbor project — a project to develop land along the Choptank River — has become a frequent topic of conversation in Cambridge.\nIn May, tensions between CWDI and the City of Cambridge came to a head when the city filed a lawsuit against CWDI alleging the organization had violated a transfer agreement it entered into with the city in June 2021. Later that month, the city and CWDI entered into mediation before a retired judge.\nAlso in May, Cambridge lost its city manager, Tom Carroll. In his resignation letter to the mayor and City Council, Carroll cited ongoing concerns with the Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Cambridge Harbor project, in particular the financial feasibility of the project.\nIn an email to the Star Democrat in May, Carroll said he hoped that he was wrong and that Cambridge Harbor will \"become a storybook success.\"\n\"But I fear that I will be correct in its lasting and long-term negative impacts for Cambridge unless it is fundamentally changed,\" he wrote. \"I can no longer stand by while this project moves forward in its current form and with the current governance structure.\"\nThe agreement for Leonard to leave could be that fundamental change Carroll talked about.\nLeonard leaves CWDI in poor financial shape, and the board will have to its work cut out to fix that problem.\nHengst said neither the ongoing legal disputes nor the development corporation's dire financial situation led to Leonard's departure, but she noted that CWDI does not have the money to hire a new executive director at this point.\n\"Unfortunately, based on our financials, ... we do not have the funds to take a new executive director,\" she said.\nSo why should Cambridge residents thank Matt Leonard?\nFor all of his faults — and there were many — Leonard offered a grand vision for Cambridge and a prime piece of real estate along the Choptank River. Leonard dreamed big. The projects he proposed were spectacular and would have transformed Cambridge Harbor.\nThe CWDI board needs to repair its ties with the City of Cambridge and its residents. The vision Leonard proposed is worth pursuing. It just needs to be done in a financially prudent manner and needs to involve the community from start to finish.\nWe heard a developer recently talk about Cambridge residents, describing many of them as disillusioned and defeated. A successful Cambridge Harbor project could change that.\nWe think that Angie Hengst has the leadership skills to rebuild trust in CWDI and begin a new partnership with city officials to move the Cambridge Harbor project forward.\nRemoving Matt Leonard was a good first step. Now she will need to put those leadership skills to work and make this project a reality.\nWe wish her luck. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass restrictions head to Supreme Court\n\n March 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@kibaytimes.com | Section: Local News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — A coalition of Maryland fishing associations and charter boat operators have escalated their legal battle against new striped bass fishing restrictions, filing an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to block the regulations. Captain Robert Newberry, chairman of Delmarva Fisheries Association stated, \"We will take this case to the highest court until this matter is resolved — it is far from over.\"The Delmarva Fisheries Association and the Maryland Charter Boat Association, along with two individual commercial fishermen, argue that the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (the Commission) recent measures impose \"drastic, unwarranted, and illegal limitations\" on striped bass fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast. The petition, filed March 4, claims the restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution and could jeopardize the livelihoods of many small businesses.\nThe case follows months of legal disputes in lower courts, where the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the Commission's 2024 striped bass management plan, known as Addendum II. The plan, approved in January by a 14-2 vote, reduced commercial quotas, shortened fishing seasons, and limited recreational anglers to catching just one striped bass per day instead of two.\nMaryland and New Jersey voted against the measure, but Maryland ultimately implemented the restrictions under pressure from the Commission and federal agencies. The Maryland Attorney General's Office acknowledged in a letter that failing to comply could trigger a federal moratorium on all striped bass fishing in state waters.\nWhen confronted with having to cut the catch limitation in half, Assistant Director and Fisheries Manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and proxy to the Marine Fisheries Commission Michael Luisi, warned the Commission that limiting Maryland's charter boat clients' catch to one fish a day \"will put people out of business.\"\nDocuments filed with the court by the plaintiffs state Luisi was \"pointedly correct in this assessment but the ASMFC and its federal and other illegally voting partners as well as other member states, including Maryland at that point, decided that its guesstimate on fish-spawning futures five years into the future was more important than the impending demise of these family-run, small businesses.\"\nNewberry said, it is was \"extremely perturbing that Governor Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown turned their backs on us in the seafood industry in Maryland and also all of us here on the Eastern Shore.\" Moore never weighed in on this constitutional issue affecting those in the seafood industry, but will \"spend millions of taxpayers dollars defending the citizens of Maryland against the so-called constitutional violations of President Trump,\" Newberry said. \"We have not only been left behind, we have tire tracks on our backs from where we have been run over, and left behind.\"\n\"The economic damage is undeniable,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"We've seen a 75-85% decline in business, boats being sold off, and captains leaving the industry. The Commission rushed through regulations without considering the devastating impact on local livelihoods.\"\nHardman continued, \"...the 2025 numbers are continuing to be off by the same ratios or worse; that an unprecedented 53 charter boats have been sold or listed for sale since 2024; and, that 43 \"for hire\" Charter Boat businesses have already been forced to close their doors with another 11 companies losing money at a rate that will soon bring about the same result.\"\nThe legal challenge focuses on alleged constitutional violations, including the 10th Amendment's prohibition on federal overreach, the 5th Amendment's protection against government takings without just compensation, and the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The plaintiffs also argue that the Commission, originally established as an advisory body, has unlawfully assumed regulatory powers without proper state and federal oversight.\nDespite warnings from industry representatives that the new rules would cripple the state's fishing economy, the Commission stood by its decision, citing concerns about overfishing and the need to rebuild the striped bass population by 2029. However, critics claim the commission relied on faulty data, pointing out that the agency's own projections have fluctuated — from a 97% chance of population recovery in 2023 to just 15% in 2024, before rebounding to 50% in 2025.\nIn a statement, the Commission defended its methodology, emphasizing that conservation measures are necessary to prevent further declines in the striped bass stock.\n\"The science may be imperfect, but the consequences of inaction could be severe,\" said a Commission spokesperson. \"We understand the economic hardship this creates, but the long-term health of the fishery must come first.\"\nYet the plaintiffs stated, there are in excess of 240 million striped bass in U.S. waters and the annual number of fishing removals is approximately six million.\nThe Supreme Court previously declined to hear an emergency appeal in May, citing a lack of prior appellate review. The plaintiffs now return to the high court after exhausting their legal options in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled in February that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs had sued the Commission rather than the state of Maryland.\nWith the 2025 fishing season set to begin in May, the petitioners are urging the Supreme Court to issue an injunction that would restore previous fishing limits while the legal battle plays out. Without relief, they warn that more charter businesses will shut down, further damaging Maryland's historic fishing industry.\n\"The Supreme Court is our last hope,\" Hardman said. \"We're not asking for special treatment—just the right to keep our businesses afloat.\"\nA decision on the emergency petition filed March 4, could come within weeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Commission President Tom Costigan administered the oath of office.\nAfter Sharp was sworn in, Costigan introduced Sharp. He said that she previously worked for the Town of St. Michaels. According to the Town of St. Michaels website, Sharp was the town's finance clerk and Water Department and billing clerk.\n\"We're thrilled to have her with us, and we expect great things,\" Costigan said to Sharp.\nThe clerk-treasurer is a new position for the Town of Oxford.\nAccording to the job posting on the town's website, Sharp will be tasked with directing and managing the town's finances under the town manager's direction and implementing policy set by the Commissioners of Oxford. The clerk-treasurer will act as the chief financial officer of the town.\nThe creation of this position was talked about at a Jan. 11 commissioners meeting, when Commissioner Katrina Greer said she wanted to discuss the possibility of hiring someone to take on the town's financial duties.\nAt the Jan. 11 meeting, Greer said this could address a material weakness detailed in the town's audit for the town's lack of internal controls. This has been a finding in town audits going back to 2016.\n\"This would take some burden off the manager and enable us to comply with the audit recommendation of having multiple people performing financial roles,\" she said at the meeting.\nTown Manager Cheryl Lewis said she had shared this idea with the commissioners originally because hiring more employees is the way to solve the internal controls issue.\n\"Admittedly most towns our size can't afford more staff,\" Lewis said at the Jan. 11 meeting. \"Oxford is not in that situation, per se.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Time to reframe conversation about literacy\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA BLOTTENBERGER and TRISH BRENNAN-GAC | Section: Columns \n \n 774\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland State Department of Education's draft literacy policy aims to establish a framework to support students and teachers. Yet, the conversation around this policy has been dominated by the issue of retention. By doing so, we are overlooking its broader intent: creating a robust support system.With the Maryland State Board of Education discussing this policy last Tuesday, it's time we shift our focus to what truly matters: preparing and empowering our children to become fluent readers.\nMSDE's draft policy seeks to tackle the reading crisis by addressing far more than the potential retention of students. It seeks to equip teachers with the tools, training and resources they need to foster foundational reading skills in every child, track their progress and provide strategic, targeted interventions when necessary. The draft policy includes several critical components designed to achieve this goal, yet these have been largely overlooked in the public discourse.\nOne of the most vital aspects of the draft policy is how it leverages the Ready to Read Act with its emphasis on early screening and assessment. Historically, teachers have lacked resources and guidance to identify and address reading deficiencies early on. The draft policy aims to change that by providing a step-by-step guide that helps teachers flag students who may be at risk, identify the specific skills they need to develop, and target the support students need.\nAnother cornerstone of the policy is the emphasis on professional learning and coaching. Diagnostics are only effective if teachers know how to use the results to inform instruction.\nThe draft policy outlines a plan for ongoing professional development to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills they need to support students at every stage. Training and support, with regard to the science of reading, must be provided to all teachers of reading, pre-K to 12 in order for the data to translate into improved student outcomes.\nThe draft policy also introduces the concept of a Student Reading Improvement Plan. This plan is designed to be a collaborative effort between teachers and parents, ensuring that everyone involved in a child's education is on the same page. To bridge the gap between the technical language used by educators and what parents can easily understand, MSDE is developing a toolkit that educators can use to communicate more effectively with parents.\nWhile much of the debate has centered on retention, it's crucial to understand that this policy is as much about prevention as it is about intervention. Perhaps retaining students may indeed prevent those who lack foundational reading skills from advancing and ultimately falling through the cracks. We say \"may\" because we acknowledge the research is complex and the findings are mixed.\nHowever, if the state adopts a retention approach, it must be implemented with great care. Retention should be strategically designed as a last-resort intervention, after all other support measures have been exhausted.\nIn some cases, retention might be a more effective short-term solution than advancing students who are not prepared, as long as additional time and support are provided. And, we should recognize that the retention component of the policy may incentivize districts to collaborate closely with the MSDE, ensuring shared responsibility for implementing a comprehensive system of support for all students.\nFinally, if we are serious about addressing the reading crisis, we need to extend our focus beyond early elementary grades. Middle and high school students who lack foundational reading skills require targeted interventions to help them catch up. This will extend to students who may be advancing to high grades without the foundational skills needed to master challenging texts. The conversation about retention should therefore include discussions about how we support older students who have fallen behind.\nMSDE's draft literacy policy represents a comprehensive statewide approach to improving literacy. However, the public discourse has been too narrowly focused on the issue of retention, neglecting the critical support that the policy seeks to provide. It's time we change this conversation and recognize the full scope of the policy's potential. It's a straightforward approach that, if implemented correctly, could have a significant impact on literacy outcomes for all Maryland students.\nBy focusing on assessments, comprehensive professional development and coaching, and better parental engagement, we can create a system that not only addresses the reading crisis but also ensures that every child in Maryland has the opportunity to become a fluent, confident reader. An ongoing dialogue with MSDE to learn how they are responding to the feedback they received is essential to building public trust and educators' buy-in to the final policy.\nLisa Blottenberger is the founder of Boundless Expectations Inc., a Maryland READS board member and co-founder of Decoding Dyslexia Maryland.

    "content": "Oxford's next town manager faces controversies on western shore\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 835\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — As Oxford prepares to welcome Holly Wahl as its next town manager, controversy is swirling in the town where she was previously employed.Wahl announced her resignation as Chesapeake Beach's town administrator on Dec. 4, amid some turmoil in the western shore town.\nBruce Wahl, who had served as mayor of Chesapeake Beach from 2008 to 2016, ran for the position again earlier this year and was elected mayor on Nov. 5.\nPrior to Election Day, in social media posts, Bruce Wahl said that if elected, the \"persecution of town citizens\" by \"the current town administration will completely cease.\"\nHis comments were related to complaints from residents who claimed their water and sewer bills have recently risen dramatically.\nHolly Wahl and Bruce Wahl are not related.\nIn interviews with the Star Democrat on Friday, the Commissioners of Oxford said they were aware of and not concerned about the controversy in Chesapeake Beach.\n\"We're confident that we hired the right person,\" Oxford Commission President Norm Bell said. \"We were delighted to talk to her. We're very comfortable in her experiences and how they can help the town. And that's what we based the decision (on).\"\nBell said his understanding of the water and sewer bill issue is that people weren't paying annual water and sewer bill connection fees. He said that when Wahl took on her position in Chesapeake Beach, she saw that as a problem and made sure the town started collecting that money.\nDuring a Chesapeake Beach Town Council work session in early September, Wahl said audits revealed \"significant underpayment of connection fees\" by commercial properties and said the delinquent payments amounted to a $6 million loss to the town.\nIn an email, Wahl told the Star Democrat: \"My record of contributions to the Town of Chesapeake Beach, MD, is publicly available on the Town's website, along with meeting minutes and recordings. I am very much looking forward to working with the Commissioners, staff, citizens, and businesses of the Town of Oxford.\"\nOxford Commissioner Katrina Greer said Friday that Wahl is a \"highly qualified and ethical manager\" who was \"wringing out corruption\" in the connection fees issue.\n\"And it only made me feel stronger about hiring her,\" Greer said.\nOxford Commissioner Tom Costigan said Wahl was carefully vetted by the hiring search firm Baker Tilly. He said the information coming out about Wahl is not something the commissioners are worried about.\n\"We interviewed a lot of candidates,\" he said. \"We narrowed it down to four. She was by far the strongest of the four, and we are optimistic about her future performance here in Oxford.\"\nOxford hired Baker Tilly to do the search after the town announced the hire of — and then three days later announced they would be parting ways with — Michael Calvert as the next town manager.\nShortly after the news of Calvert's hire, some Oxford residents expressed concerns about the town's candidate vetting process. The week the town announced the decision to part ways with Calvert, Peggy Edwards, a former council member from the town where Calvert was previously employed, told the Star Democrat she resigned from the council due to issues with Calvert and the city's mayor. She said that when Calvert was in the position, there was a lack of transparency and mismanagement of money.\nSEVERANCE PACKAGE CONCERNS\nOn the same day Wahl announced her resignation, the outgoing mayor and the Chesapeake Beach Town Council met for what was labeled an \"emergency meeting\" to consider for approval of an \"emergency ordinance\" approving a severance package for Wahl. The town's previous Mayor Pat \"Irish\" Mahoney said the severance package was reasonable.\nThe ordinance, which was unanimously approved by the current council, gives Wahl a severance of six months' salary and all accrued vacation time. Southern Maryland News, which is owned and operated by the same company as the Star Democrat, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the dollar amount of Wahl's compensation package.\nThe approved ordinance states that Wahl will receive the compensation \"in a lump sum with one payment paid prior to Dec. 18, 2024, based upon her wage rate on the date of her resignation.\"\nIn addition to the compensation, the ordinance stipulates that \"the town agrees to hold Holly Wahl harmless in any future actions including all indemnification and attorneys' fees for any action that may be pursued against her.\"\nDuring the public comment portion of the Dec. 4 meeting, a few citizens spoke out against the pending action. Daniel Duvall, who lost the race for a Chesapeake Beach Town Council seat by three votes, said approving a severance package \"is not an emergency\" and was \"a questionable use of taxpayer funds.\"\nAnother Chesapeake Beach resident, Deborah Buckingham, reiterated the ordinance did not \"meet the criteria of an emergency.\" She added, \"Holly Wahl doesn't deserve any severance.\"\nThere was plenty of praise for the town administrator at the meeting, too.\n\"She's fantastic. I've never seen so much communication in the last eight years,\" Randy Getman, the town's election administrator, said. \"I have no issue with Bruce Wahl wanting to pick his own town administrator.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dangerous minds - Israel-Hamas war, Musk comments, police surveillance spark new social media fights\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Holy Land war between Israel and Hamas is birthing increased police and government surveillance of social media, prompting calls for more Americans to report \"hate crimes\" and proposals to require all social media accounts to have public name verifications amid concerns about increases in antisemitism and terrorism threats.There are also pushes to deport some anti-war, pro-Palestinian foreign college students deemed supportive of U.S. designated terror groups and expel and ban Palestinian refugees from entering the country.The efforts are born out of security concerns stemming from U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terror attacks. But they are also sparking concerns about stunting or intimating dissent, privacy and other free speech protections.There is also a new social media battle over Twitter/X owner Elon Musk's support for a social media post that talked about anti-white sentiments among \"Jewish communities.\" A number of major media and technology advertisers, who also compete with social media platforms and some of Musk's technology ventures, have paused advertising on X. That includes Disney (which owns ABC and ESPN), Apple, Paramount Global (which owns CBS and Comedy, IBM, Comcast/NBC Universal (which owns NBC and MSNBC) and Warner Bros/Discovery (which owns CNN).Musk said he agreed with a post from a Twitter who said \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" \"You said the actual truth,\" Musk said in a reply Nov. 15, latter adding that his concurrence was geared toward progressive activist groups and the Anti-Defamation League.The Biden administration condemned Musk's statement Friday. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,\" the U.S. administration said in statement drawing parallels to the beliefs of the Robert Bowers, who faces the death penalty after the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh left 11 congregants dead.The ADL on Nov. 16 also criticized Musk. \"it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblalt, who on Friday then praised Musk for his condemnation of pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas phrases 'from the river to the sea' and 'decolonization.' Musk said Saturday some of the critics are dangerously using the episode to squelch free speech and that. he plans on suing progressive activists he claims inaccurately showed neo-Nazi and antisemitic posts next to Twitter/X advertisers' promotions.\"I am sticking to my principles. As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,\" Musk said on his social media platform.EXPELLING FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTSThere is a GOP push to expel foreign college students deemed to be supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. government's list of terrorist groups.A group of 21 GOP attorneys general - including Ashley Moody of Florida and Austin Knudsen of Montana - want the federal government to \"vigorously renew vetting of foreign students' and deport those deemed to have endorsed or provided \"material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\" \"It is possible that renewed vetting of foreign students already admitted to the United States may reveal activity that renders them ineligible to hold a student visa and liable to deportation,\" Knudsen, Moody and their cohorts wrote in a letter Nov. 8 to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S.Department of Education.Free speech and civil liberties advocates say the reactions to anti-Israel war protests (some of which have seen antisemitic rhetoric) can bleed into censorship as well as quieting and punishing voices of dissent.\"Free speech means protecting speech you don't like. Sometimes it even means protecting speech you find abhorrent and hateful,\" said U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, after voting against censure measure aimed at U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her anti-Israel rhetoric and use of a pro-Hamas slogan.BANNING PALESTINIAN REFUGEESA group of congressional Republicans - including U.S. Reps. Andy Thomas, who represents the Eastern Shore, along with U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke of Montana and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, are also leading efforts to keep Palestinian refugees from the war out of the U.S. Zinke, Harris and Greene also wants to kick out Palestinians who entered the country on or after Oct. 1 in the aftermath of the Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.They say said he does not trust the Biden administration or Palestinian authorities to adequately screen potential refugees.Critics say the proposal is xenophobic.Similar sentiments related to refugees and college students have been echoed by 2024 GOP presidential candidates such as former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has suspended pro-Palestinian students' groups in his home state deemed extremist and favored restrictions on public library and school curricula content deemed inappropriate or offensive.While conservatives press universities, who have sometimes aggressively banned right-wing voices from their campuses, to condemn and crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, the American Civil Liberties Union wants them to uphold free speech principles.\"It is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus.These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\"The First Amendment protects all people who live in this country, whether they're here as citizens, foreign nationals, or visitors,\" the civil liberties group said.ENCOURAGING MORE HATE CRIME REPORTINGDaines and a bipartisan senators including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, have also recently written to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asking for more investigative and enforcement resources to be dedicated to addressing antisemitism.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 300% increase in anti-Jewish threats, vandalism and violence since the start of the war, which has seen more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 11,000 Gazans killed.In a separate letter, U.S. Sen Jon Tester, D-Montana, also said FBI and DHS efforts should also be focused on white supremacists echoing past and current Biden administration efforts to go after alt-right groups.The Biden White House, which has put a focus on going after right-wing groups since taking office in 2021, has also launched a new task force to go after \"Islamophobia\" during the war.On Tuesday, the FBI said it added Oregon to a nationwide effort aimed at encouraging getting more Americans to report \"hate incidents' ' with billboards posted in Eugene, Medford and Corvallis as well as digital signs at Portland International Airport.Similar hate crime billboards have been put up across the country, including last month in North Carolina, along with ads on public transit systems, social media platforms and local media outlets.Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released new data showing there was a 7.3% increase in reported hate crimes in 2022 (11,634 cases versus 10,840) in 2021.There were more than 6,500 racially motivated incidents - 52% of them aimed at Blacks - and more than 2,000 cases related to religion - with 55% targeting Jews, according to DOJ.SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE, FORCED VERIFICATIONSA state law in Montana backed by Knudsen and GOP Gov.Greg Gianforte banning Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is also one of the central fronts in efforts to restrict social media platforms and content.Montana lawmakers worry about TikTok's data security and ties to the Chinese government.The ban is being mirrored in other states.The Montana prohibition is being challenged by TikTok and free speech advocates in court.But there are also other efforts to increase government regulations and scrutiny and law enforcement surveillance of social media.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Nov. 13 that state police have ramped up social media surveillance and will reach out more to individuals and groups posting hate speech online.\"We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts. What's being said on social media platforms.And we have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity. and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms,\" Hochul said. \"Our media analysis, our social media analysis unit, has ramped up its monitoring of sites to catch incitement to violence; direct threats to others.\" The New York governor said the rise in extremist and violent threats after the start of the war in the Middle East \"poses a clear and present danger.\" But the idea of more aggressive police surveillance of social media posts raises some concerns.Gerard Kassar, chairman of the New York Conservative Party, said police social media monitoring is potentially \"chilling to the core\".\"Law enforcement authorities can and should monitor legitimate terrorism suspects online, but spying on everyday citizens is unconstitutional and wrong,\" Kassar said.Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to require all social media accounts be verified by name thus eliminating anonymous online speech on major platforms.\"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,\" said Haley, who is increasingly being promoted as an establishment and neoconservative 2024 alternative to former president Donald Trump.\"First of all, it's a national security threat. When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say. And it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots. And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what they say, and they know their pastor and their family members are going to see it,\" Haley told Fox News.Haley also backs a TikTok ban pointing to the recent viral traffic of a letter criticizing Israel and the U.S. from Osama Bin Laden.Harris told Fox News Nov. 16 that Congress could soon take some actions related to TikTok and the issue will come down to speech versus national security, citing the platform's Chinese ownership.The verification push sparked a backlash from free speech advocates, particularly on the right who have already been upset over social media bans and content restrictions over coronavirus vaccines and challenges to the 2020 election results.They say it will eliminate anonymous dissent and speech.\"Nikki Haley is 'openly' pushing for the government to use private tech companies to censor speech. This is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and straight out of the Democrats' playbook.Any politician who thinks it's OK for the government to use the private sector as its censorship bureau shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy, who has frequently sparred with Haley over TikTok and other issues. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nTwitter/X, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk gestures during an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRepublican presidential candidates former U.N.

The children lived at that Cole Street residence with their mother, police added. Investigators have not publicly identified their mother.\nTroopers assigned to the agency's North East Barrack responded to the Cole Street residence shortly before 1:20 p.m. on Jan. 16 to assist Perryville Police Department officers with what law enforcement officials described at the time as the \"cardiac arrest of two juveniles,\" police reported. Paramedics were attempting emergency medical care on the children when troopers arrived, police said. Paramedics later pronounced the boy and girl dead at the scene, police added.\n\"The sister reported her brother and sister were suffering from an unknown medical condition. She later told police that she came home and found her siblings unconscious on their bedroom floor. Police believe there was no one else in the home at the time,\" an MSP spokesperson outlined one day after the deadly incident.\nThat spokesperson also reported that \"there was no indication of violence in the area surrounding the location where the juveniles were found.\"\nInvestigators found \"drug paraphernalia\" and \"other items of evidentiary value\" while searching the Cole Street residence, after obtaining a warrant to do so, police reported.\nOn Jan. 17, one day after the children died, MSP officials reported that the cause and manner of their deaths remained unknown after autopsies performed on the bodies of Skylar and Gaige \"revealed no abnormalities.\" They further reported that, at that point, investigators were hopeful that then-pending toxicology results might reveal the cause and manner of the children's deaths.\nMSP investigators recently received those toxicology results, which indicate that fentanyl overdoses caused the deaths of Skylar and Gaige, according to police. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Victims of crime, family members experience catharsis\n\n May 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 943\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON — There was healing through pain and hope shining through exceedingly dark times during the Maryland Statewide Memorial Service for crime victims and their families last week.Held at the Kent County Community Center, the service was hosted by the Baltimore, Carroll, Kent and St. Mary's County State's Attorney offices and the Maryland State Board of Victim Services.\nVictim/Witness Coordinator for the Kent County State's Attorney's Office Shelly McMath said, the service alternates each year between counties. This year, it was in Kent County and had a turnout of about 30 people.\nDuring the service, McMath was honored for her time and dedication.\n\"She's an angel,\" one of her clients said.\nAnother client and survivor of domestic assault, Abby Joiner, said McMath was instrumental in her healing process.\n\"I am thankful to the village of people who helped me heal,\" Joyner said.\nDuring this somber ceremony to remember victims of crime and their families, Kent County professionals who work in the crime field all had a role to play.\nFollowing some emotional lyrics and skilled keyboard play by musician Marion Saunders, Rock Hall Police Chief William Dempsey read \"Say Their Names,\" adapted from a book by Don Hackett, \"Say Olin to Say Goodbye.\"\nGuests called out the names of the victims they wished to memorialize.\nAlong that same spirit, Kent County Clerk of Courts Sherise Kennard read the poem \"Don't Quit\" by Edgar Albert Guest.\nIt's a reminder that in the most trying of times, sunnier skies are ahead.\nCommissioner Albert Nickerson was the guest speaker for the day. He grew emotional when talking about his brother, Michael Scott Nickerson, who was killed in the line of duty in the 300 block of Hammond Street in Centreville on Feb. 13, 2001.\nHis message was that through adversity, it's vital to seek out a support system, family and friends, and to turn personal pain into productivity — a way to help others.\nThose survivors who stepped up to talk next exemplified that determination. They spoke of their traumatizing ordeals but also about the strength to live on, thrive and prosper.\nCelestine Heath's 15-year-old niece, I'kea Nicole Jackson, was murdered Dec. 5, 2016, in Glenn Burnie, she told attendees. As horrific as that was, she said God got the family through. Now she sees reflections of Jackson's personality in her 7-year-old granddaughter.\nFighting back tears, Heath said the two are so much alike that \"her and I'kea would have had a ball together.\"\nLorena Batson dealt with her ex-husband's domestic violence for eight years before having the courage to break free. Now, she's remarried, healed, and has a great relationship with her husband and children.\nOne of McMath's first victim-survivors, Amy Mitchell, was attacked in Rock Hall in 2007, when a person she knew for several years became \"increasingly diabolical.\" McMath's guidance connected Mitchell to the Whitsitt Center, where she got sober, and because her abuser violated his protective order, the system put him away.\nShe's thankful for the services and thankful for Kent County as a supportive place to live.\nReflecting back, Mitchell said she's amazed at the life she has now.\nMany more victim-survivors stepped up to tell their story.\nAll were different, but the drive to overcome despite the circumstances was a common theme.\nSue Nickerson, the commissioner's mother, added to her son's story, reliving those moments of riding to the hospital after hearing that her son was shot.\nLooking back, she said she's grateful for the huge amount of support she received from family and friends, especially during the two-year period between the incident and the trial of her son's killer.\nNow she helps others through their pain as the president and executive director of the Maryland Concerns of Police Survivors.\nShe found a way to still see her son in the profession he loved.\n\"I was told a long time ago that if I were to look into the center of every officer's badge, I would see Michael,\" she said.\nMcMath said talking about these experiences encourages others to step up.\nEven Kennard walked up to the podium to speak, not as Clerk of Courts, but as a victim survivor.\nFor the first time publicly she told the tragic story of her mother, Joyce Henson, who was set on fire by her husband while Kennard was in school at 16 years of age.\nKennard drew strength from that, seeing the way her mother was able to embrace life after being burned on 80% of her body.\n\"She is a survivor, thank God. She is so strong. She's physically burned, but when I look at her I see beauty and faith,\" Kennard said.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president For All Seasons, spoke close to last, and was also closely acquainted with domestic violence. Not only did she work with victims everyday, as a clinician, she witnessed it through her husband, whose sister was killed at the hands of an ex-boyfriend.\nDorman said she sees how it affected him and his journey to come to terms with it.\nShe encouraged survivors to do everything they can to care for their well-being, taking the time and space they need to heal.\nAfter a responsive reading of \"We Remember Them\" written by Marilyn Gilbert and read by Chief Ron Dixon of the Chestertown Police Department, McMath was honored.\nShe accepted two proclamations from the Governor's Office and the State's Attorney's Office of Kent County with gratitude, recalling later how she started working with the police as a dispatcher right out of high school.\nShe said she loves what she does, helping people through tough times and getting them the services they need.\nMaster of Ceremonies, Kent State's Attorney Bryan DiGregory, said, \"I have been fortunate enough to work with Shelly. Her intelligence is only surpassed by her compassion. And I think many of you in this room know her compassion. It's extraordinary.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Warriors battle but can’t extend win streak against undefeated Bennett\n\n October 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 714\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Avery Brice was eager for Monday night.\"I was very excited about this game tonight just to see where we were at as far as playing against top competition,\" Easton High's first-year boys head soccer coach said of facing undefeated and defending Bayside Conference champion James M. Bennett.\nAfter 80 minutes, the Warriors were where everyone else has been this season after playing the Clippers — behind on the scoreboard.\nAnd yet despite watching Easton's four-game win streak come to a halt in a 3-0 loss, Brice was largely encouraged by what he saw from his team.\n\"Goals change momentum,\" said Brice, who watched the Clippers take a 1-0 lead, when star Noah Blankensop gained possession on left wing, and, with Easton keeper Sam Hutchison far from his goal, sent a ball drifting over everyone before settling into the right side of the net with 15 minutes, 27 seconds left in the first half. \"I loved how we responded. Going down a goal sucks. Guys responded great. Better than we have previously. We get scored on and it's like, 'Wow.' You just see everyone drop. But tonight you saw guys, 'Hey come on. Next play. Let's go again.' I was really proud of them for that.\"\nBrice was also proud of Hutchison's play in goal. The junior keeper stopped a hard shot by Blankensop in the 9th minute and made a save on Sebastien Dorvelus just a moment later to keep the game scoreless. Hutchison then made perhaps his stop of the game, when he punched away a shot that banged off the left post with 7 minutes left in the first half, keeping it a one-goal game.\n\"Goalie had a huge night,\" Brice said of Hutchison, who finished with 11 saves. \"Crazy saves. One of the best games I've seen him play.\"\nBennett (8-0), which has beaten six of its eight opponents this season by six or more goals — the exceptions, Queen Anne's (3-0 on Sept. 19) and now Easton — looked ready to take a 1-0 lead halftime. But with just over 10 seconds remaining, Grant Ziervogel served a ball that Easton's Felix Valentin attempted to head away, only to watch it go into the net for a 2-0 Clippers lead.\n\"The own goal, miscommunication,\" Brice said. \"We learn from it. Felix, he is an amazing defender and I told him, he's saved games prior to this. 'Don't even worry about it. It happens. It's part of the game.'\"\nThe Warriors (6-2) thought they cut their deficit in half with 20:20 left in the game, when Clay Nagel, with Bennett keeper Jake Ziervogel away from the goal and two defenders on his back, caught up to a ball and touched it into the net. But the goal was waved off, when Nagel was ruled offsides.\n\"First competitive (game),\" Bennett head coach Gabe Kane said. \"First one that wasn't decided by halftime.\n\"We don't want 12 strolls,\" said Kane in reference to the Clippers outscoring their opponents, 53-2 this season. \"We want to be battle tested, and Easton came at us for 80 minutes today. There was no quit in them. They seemed to play harder after the third goal. I think they had more chances at the end of the game when I know they were tired. But they kept battling.\"\nBennett bumped its lead to 3-0 as Grason Adkins scored from the right side of the box with 7:26 left.\nJake Ziervogel, who according to Kane has not had more than one save in a game this season prior to Monday, made a leaping stop on Ale Monroy with 6:45 left. Blankensop, who was recruited by a number of Division I schools but is headed to Salisbury University, just missed pushing the lead to 4-0 in the waning moments when he blasted a shot off the crossbar.\n\"I knew they were going to be our best opponent we'd play to date,\" Brice said. \"I think we made some silly mistakes and we paid for them. But they are just minor ones. We switched off for a moment, not marking in the box, not getting and winning the second ball in the box.\n\"The score does not reflect how we played,\" Brice continued. \"I think going forward, we work on finishing our chances and then just being a little more creative up top.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The $1.1 million contract was passed unanimously.\nShafer said some preliminary work will be done this spring before school ends. The school play and other concerts or events won't be impacted, Shafer said.\nOver in Cordova, the under-renovation Chapel District Elementary School will receive glazing for its new windows. The window glazing is a security film, Shafer said, a safety measure that \"prevents easy access to the school building.\"\nAll other schools in the district have the window glazing.\nChapel District Elementary is currently under renovation, a multimillion endeavor expected to be done sometime in 2026.\nThe contract is through a Maryland Center for School Safety grant in the amount of $132,000 for the window glazing. Shafer said the district couldn't move forward with it during construction of the renovated school building due to cost limits during the bidding process.\nShafer said he hopes the window security upgrades can be completed this summer. The board unanimously approved the contract.\nBoard President Emily Jackson added that she has \"slight hesitations about privacy\" as it relates to windows in classrooms and libraries at Chapel District Elementary and other schools.\nJackson asked that the board hear more about potential school safety grants in the future, particularly \"in the privacy arena to provide more screening for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But none of us want that. I think he kind of brought that out of us, just saying we could be going to Navy this Friday to win a championship that hasn't been done in a decade.\"\nThe Sabres responded, outscoring No. 4 Gerstell Academy by three goals in a decisive third quarter, catapulting them to a 13-8 victory on a dreary Tuesday afternoon.\nSts. Peter & Paul (15-4) advances to Friday's MIAA B Conference championship game where it will meet second-seed and two-time defending champion Archbishop Curley (11-7) at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium at 5 p.m. The Sabres defeated Curley twice during the regular season.\n\"They were taking a team lightly, like they've already won,\" said Wolters, whose team won 7-6 at Gerstell on April 12, then routed the Falcons 16-3 on their home turf April 30. \"And they've done that before. We just lose focus.\"\nIn his first game back from injury, JJ Rardin (five goals) gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter, when he scored off an assist from Andrew Steinhardt.\nGerstell (6-10) tied the score on Bronson Peters' goal less than 2 minutes into the second quarter. Rardin gained possession out in front of the net and fired his second goal just under the crossbar to make it 2-1 just 18 seconds later. But the Falcons came right back with Ryan Ellis beating Sabres goalie Hank Wolters (11 saves) to make it 2-all.\nDavis Kimminau whipped a shot in from the right side, and less than two minutes later, set up Vincent Dyer's goal to nudge Sts. Peter & Paul to a 4-2 lead. But Peters (four goals) scored at the midway point of the second quarter to make it a one-goal game again.\n\"They came out and they didn't want their season to end,\" Messick said of Gerstell. \"They came out with nothing to lose. We're the one seed. They come out and they beat us, then it's a huge upset. And if they don't it's not what they were expected to do. So I think they had that mentality while we came out thinking, 'Well, we smoked them before. We're going to roll them this time.' But they didn't. They came out and they fought really hard.\"\nThe Sabres scored the last three goals of the half, as Liam Durnbaugh, Noah Zimmerman and Rardin each tallied to make it 7-3 at the break.\n\"Our guys were in it,\" Gerstell head coach Ryan Drenner said. \"We stayed in the fight the entire game. That was the biggest difference. We were here a couple weeks ago April 30. Very lopsided. We try to learn a lesson from every game regardless of the outcome of the game. And so for that one it was we had to come up with a better plan of how to travel down here and be ready to go from the jump. So we changed how we warm up just to be a little bit more alert from the start. I thought our guys did that today and we played four quarters of a great lacrosse game.\"\nGerstell cut its deficit to 7-4 just 19 seconds into the third quarter on a goal by Peters. Zimmerman scored for the Sabres, but Matthew Schols answered for the Falcons.\nSts. Peter & Paul took control the remainder of the quarter, getting one goal each from Steinhardt (four assists) and Kimminau, and two more from Rardin for a 12-5 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\"We know how good we are,\" Wolters said. \"The third quarter we go and we really just started opening it up. And then in the fourth quarter we thought it was done.\"\nThe Sabres extended their lead to 13-5 before Gerstell scored the game's final three goals.\n\"We weren't hustling,\" Wolters said of certain stretches. \"We'd come down and throw it away and then they would go down and score on unsettled situations. They had eight goals and I know five to six were unsettled and we can't have that.\n\"It's a win. We'll take it,\" Wolters said. \"You can't win a championship unless you're in the championship. And we're in the championship.\"\nBASEBALL\nCOL. RICHARDSON 1, ST. MICHAELS 0\nAMERICAN CORNER — Jack Walls walked, advanced to second and third on a pair of low pitches, and raced home on a wild pitch in the third inning for what proved to be the only run Tuesday, as Colonel Richardson blanked the Saints to win the Class 1A East Region II final.\nColonel Richardson winning pitcher Daniel Hesson hurled a two-hitter. Connor Wheeler and Henry Mullikin each had a hit for the Saints.\nSt. Michaels pitcher Jacob Seek allowed one hit, that coming with two outs in the sixth inning when Hesson singled. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — A crowd of family, politicians, civic leaders and Boy Scouts assembled in the Scout House on St. Mary's Square to present the Eagle Scout Badge to Vincent Thomas Dyer Sunday.Multiple candles were lit to commemorate different aspects of his journey that started when he was 5. This is the highest honor a Scout can achieve and only about four in 100 Scouts reach it.\nDyer's sash had 26 merit badges on it, and his final project was raising $2,000 to raise a flag pole honoring veterans in Cordova. Of course, this achievment took hours of input from his family, his Troop 741 leaders and his fellow Scouts.\n\"It is now time to formally present you with Scouting's highest badge of accomplishment. The symbol of your success is the Eagle Scout badge and neckerchief, which will now be presented by your parents,\" Scoutmaster Brendan Beers said.\nOne of the most touching moments was when his parents, Paul and Kimberly, attached the Eagle Scout pin. He then attached pins on them for being a supportive Eagle Scout mom and dad.\nVincent's brother Paul Jr., also an Eagle Scout, said, \"What does the rank of Eagle Scout represent? To me it represents saying you are going to do something and then doing it. It represents goals realized, focus and strength of character. When the pressure is on and others would run around and panic, the Eagle Scout stays calm, cool and collected in the face of atrocity.\"\nAnother person who was there to guide and bear witness is Steve Bealefeld, assistant scoutmaster.\nHe said, \"He is a hard-working young man who has always had his head on straight.\"\nVincent's father listed many of the places the Scout troop went to go camping like the C & O Canal, Dorchester County and Tennessee. The biggest test was a 10-day hike at Philmont in New Mexico.\nThere was a testament to Vincent's leadership in the field. He was said to be an excellent cook with a Dutch oven. He can make peach cobbler and chicken pot pie.\n\"When he was in the lead, you were never going in the wrong direction. In the spartan wilds of Philmont, this was no small feat. Vincent is an excellent navigator. Vincent's attitude was equally as unflagging as his physical stamina. There is a deep keeled steadiness to his emotional thermostat,\" scout leader JoRoy Lizewski said.\nThen it was time for the politicians to offer large citations. President of Town of St. Michael's Commission David Breimhurst, Del. Tom Hutchison (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), community liaison to Andy Harris Mike Detmer and Maryland state Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all spoke briefly. Vincent was given the United States flag and the Maryland Flag.\nVincent had the last word.\n\"I am so proud. I am happy that all my friends from 190 and 741 were here to celebrate this event with me, because it has been a long time coming. It is a bittersweet moment. I am glad I got Eagle Scout, but I will miss Scouting as a whole,\" Vincent said.\nHe tentatively has plans to attend University of Maryland at College Park in the fall. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former 1st-rounders Toney, Farley cut\n\n August 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1124\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Kansas City receiver Kadarius Toney and Tennessee cornerback Caleb Farley, both first-round picks in the 2021 NFL draft, were among the cuts Tuesday as teams trimmed their rosters for the regular season.Toney, who figured to be on the roster bubble, was on his second team since the New York Giants drafted him 20th overall three years ago. The Titans took Farley two picks later.\nTeams had to cut their rosters to 53 players from the training camp maximum of 90. Toney, Farley and hundreds of others will be eligible to return on practice squads that allow up to 17 players, including a spot allocated for the International Player Pathway Program.\nMiami receiver Odell Beckham Jr. will begin the season on the physically unable to perform list, meaning he'll miss at least the first four games. Beckham has not seen the field with the Dolphins since signing a one-year contract in May.\nSan Francisco's initial roster is missing a big piece with holdout All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams remaining on the reserve/did not report list as he seeks a new deal. Star receiver Brandon Aiyuk is on the roster but has refused to practice unless he gets a new contract or is traded.\nInjuries shortened both of Toney's first two seasons, and he was traded to the Chiefs during his second year with the Giants. The 25-year-old never displayed his dynamic playmaking skills consistently, but did have a big role in the first of the two Super Bowl rings he got with the Chiefs.\nIn a three-minute span in the fourth quarter of Kansas City's 38-35 win over Philadelphia in Super Bowl 57, Toney made two monumental plays. First, he caught a 5-yard TD pass that gave the Chiefs a 28-27 lead. Then, he returned a punt 65 yards to the Eagles 5-yard line to set up another TD.\nBut Toney couldn't build off that success. He struggled last season, was inactive from Week 15 through the playoffs and sat out when the Chiefs finished their repeat against San Francisco.\nKansas City added veteran wideout Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown and drafted Xavier Worthy in the first round to go with Rashee Rice. The Chiefs also have Skyy Moore, Mecole Hardman and Justin Watson.\nThe Titans drafted Farley out of Virginia Tech after he was the first player from a major college to opt out of the 2020 season because of the pandemic. Farley was drafted weeks after a second surgery to repair a back injury from college.\nFarley started just twice as injuries limited him to 12 games over his first two seasons. Farley had another back procedure in 2023.\nThe 25-year-old never played last season. The Titans kept him on the physically unable to perform list after his father was killed last August in an explosion that destroyed Farley's home in North Carolina.\nArizona released quarterback Desmond Ridder, which means Clayton Tune will be Kyler Murray's backup. Ridder started 13 games for Atlanta last season before being traded to the Cardinals in the offseason.\nJacksonville released eight-year veteran quarterback C.J. Beathard with an injury designation, presumably clearing the way for Mac Jones to back up Trevor Lawrence. Jones started 42 games over the past three seasons with New England after the Patriots drafted him in the first round in 2021.\nReceiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was cut by the Chiefs after re-signing with them following his release by the Patriots this month.\nThe Cowboys put CeeDee Lamb on the commissioner exempt list a day after the All-Pro receiver agreed to a $136 million, four-year contract extension that ended his preseason-long holdout. Lamb signed the contract Tuesday.\nThe move allowed the Cowboys to put offensive lineman Chuma Edoga on the 53-man roster for a day. Lamb would take the place of Edoga, who could return from injured reserve sooner than four weeks.\nSeattle had outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu on the active roster, a sign the Seahawks believe the three-year starter can be ready in fewer than four games. Nwosu injured a knee in the preseason finale.\nThe New York Jets waived safety Jaylen Key, who was \"Mr. Irrelevant\" as the last pick in the draft. The former UAB and Alabama standout had a solid training camp, but was buried on the depth chart behind starters Chuck Clark and Tony Adams and veteran reserves Ashtyn Davis and Jarrick Bernard-Converse.\nThe Minnesota Vikings kept recovering tight end T.J. Hockenson on the physically unable to perform list, meaning the two-time Pro Bowler must miss at least the first four games. Hockenson is working through the final stage of his rehabilitation after tearing an ACL against Detroit last Dec. 24.\nThe Vikings waived safety Lewis Cine, the final pick of the first round two years ago in the first draft directed by general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah.\nCine badly broke his leg on special teams in a game early in his rookie year and never made much traction on the depth chart last season. He played a total of 10 defensive snaps in two seasons.\nDenver let go of receiver Tim Patrick, whose TD in the second preseason game was his first in 974 days. Patrick, who sustained season-ending injuries at start of training camp in 2022 and '23, had a solid summer but was victim of the Broncos' depth at his position.\nAs expected, Cleveland placed star running back Nick Chubb on the physically unable to perform list as he continues to recover from two surgeries last year. The club is optimistic Chubb will play this season.\nThe Browns released running back D'Onta Foreman, who overcame a scary neck injury in training camp. With Nyheim Hines on the non-football injury list, the Browns currently have only Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr. at running back.\nWashington released veteran receiver Martavis Bryant, who is in his second season of trying to end a long hiatus from the NFL.\nThe oft-suspended 32-year-old, who last played in the NFL in 2018, spent most of last season on Dallas' practice squad and could land in the same place with the Commanders, who signed him Aug. 13.\nFor the second season in a row, the Saints are making a change at punter, and again, they're going with an Australian rookie. This time it's 27-year-old Matthew Hayball taking over for 31-year-old Lou Hedley, who surprisingly won the job a year earlier.\nThe Buffalo Bills released receiver K.J. Hamler, their primary preseason returner, and filled the hole on special teams by acquiring defensive back Brandon Codrington in a trade with the AFC East rival Jets. The teams swapped late-round picks in next year's draft.\nSafety Ronnie Harrison (Colts), linebacker Deion Jones (Bills), running backs Matt Breida (49ers), Joshua Kelley (Giants) and Boston Scott (Rams), quarterbacks Mike White (Dolphins), Ben DiNucci (Bills), Matt Corral (Vikings) and Ian Book (Chiefs), wide receivers Sterling Shepard (Buccaneers) and Greg Ward (Colts) and defensive back Terrell Edmunds (Jaguars) also were cut. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is supporting and sustaining our own food production on the Shore.\"\nThe full scale market opening on April 20 will be an expansion of the Avalon Foundation's Winter Market, which it has run in the off-season. The full market will run until the second week of December, after which the Winter Market will pick back up.\n\"This year was the first that we went all year round with some vendors. This constitutes the opening of the Spring Market in its full glory as we expand to fill the entire municipal lot,\" Nuthall said. \"We have lots of vegetables because many of our farmers are growing in high tunnels. We do have vendors there this Saturday, but the full market won't open until April 20.\"\nThe market is located in a municipal parking lot on the 100 block of North Harrison Street in downtown Easton.\nSome of the vendors include Triangle Acres, Cottingham Farm, Honeybee Flower Farm, The Federal Brewing Company, CD Produce, Quarter Acre Farm and Gingersnap Farm.\nThe market will have several bakeries, produce growers and local honey. It will have woodworking and textile crafts for sale, along with other locally-made goods. There will be live music every Saturday starting at 10:30 a.m.\nAn interactive map of vendors is available at maps.managemymarket.\nNuthall said in addition to being able to view the roster of vendors for the duration of the calendar year, those who visit the link can also view vendor contact information, the types of items they sell and their location in the market.\nThere is parking available at Brewer's Lane, or the lot on the corner of Washington and Bay Streets. There will be a marked accessible parking space for those with disability parking needs.\nThe St. Michaels Farmers Market will be open from April 13 to Nov. 23 on Saturdays from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. It is located on 206 S. Talbot Street.\n\"(St. Michaels Farmers Market) is in its 27th season and is the small town, producer-only farmers market of Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" said Market Manager Sandy Lawler. \"We are also the only market on the Eastern Shore that has a SNAP dollar for dollar matching program.\"\nLike Easton, the St. Michaels market has a wide array of bakers, farmers and artisans. Some of these include Little Fields Floral, Tilghman Island Baking, D&D Dog Treats, Scottish Highland Creamery, Chesapeake Mushrooms and Lyon Rum. There is also a weekly changing community and education tent and weekly musicians. Building African American Minds will be in the community and education tent on opening day.\nFor veggies, vendors include Shaky Wheelbarrow Herb Sales, Krieder's Tomatoes, Oksana's Produce Farm, Vintage Family Farm and Mindful Acres. Cottingham will have organic vegetables.\nNight Kitchen Coffee Roasters, Casa Carmen Wines, Willwaw Farm, Fat and Happy Farms and Agave Juice and Elysium Farm will all be offering their creations.\nLawler put her finger on why this market is so enduring.\n\"Farmers Markets are important for so many reasons,\" she said. \"... The biggest one is the support of our own community. Neighbor feeding neighbor with minimal transport, which means fresher healthier products including a lower environmental impact. Knowing your farmer means you are buying from someone who is a steward of the land.\"\nOpening day, the market will have Talbot County Public Schools students playing from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., followed by WabiSabi to close.\nFor more information, call 410-713-0507. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That was an awesome play.\"\nPinder found the back of the net for what proved to me the winning goal with 3:08 remaining, then watched goalie Maddie George and her defense survive three shots in a frenetic final 20 seconds Monday, as the Lions held on for a 7-6 victory over Stephen Decatur and their third straight Bayside Conference championship at Kent Island High's Andy Schipul Stadium.\n\"It feels so good to win, especially after losing the first time,\" Pinder said of Queen Anne's 10-7 loss at Decatur on April 16. \"This time I think we knew we were a better team, and we had changed since the beginning of the season. And we had a lot more confidence in ourselves, and we really just wanted to come out and prove ourselves.\"\nBut Decatur senior Sadie Kauffman (four goals) scored to break a 4-4 tie with 8:27 left in the third quarter, then converted a Lions turnover into a 6-4 Seahawks lead less than 3 minutes later.\nThat would prove to be Decatur's final goal though.\n\"Stephen Decatur did an amazing job,\" Fitzgerald said. \"We just needed to execute on our possessions a little bit better and show a little bit more patience. But they always make it happen. I trust them. We're in those huddles and they're giving feedback on what needs to happen on the draw and they're the ones out there.\"\nAmong those out there was junior standout RJ Ensor (four goals, assist), who pulled the Lions (11-2) within 6-5 with 2:26 left in the third, when she scored on a free-position opportunity.\nThe Lions pulled even at 6-all with 5:44 left, as Ensor took a feed from Pinder (two goals, three assists) and deposited an overhand shot past Decatur goalie Addison McDaniel.\nKauffman won the ensuing draw, but the Seahawks turned the ball over with 4 minutes remaining.\n\"We were calling to pull it out and take a little bit more time off, and maybe work for last shot. And she finds herself right on top of the goal,\" Fitzgerald said of Pinder.\nPinder didn't miss, dumping a shot past McDaniel for a 7-6 Lions lead.\n\"We knew that we could come back,\" Pinder said. \"We just had to play patient and smart, and we knew we had it.\n\"I knew I had to take my time and put it in the net,\" Pinder said of her game-winner. \"I knew I was on top of the goal and knew I had to do it and make it.\"\nDecatur called time and appeared to win the ensuing draw. But the Seahawks were called for an apparent empty-stick check, that initially appeared to be against the Lions.\n\"I don't understand what it was,\" Decatur head coach Lindsay Owens said. \"I definitely thought it was an empty-stick check on Queen Anne's because Sadie's stick went flying. And he (the official) was pointing our way too.\n\"But here's the thing,\" Owens continued. \"We shouldn't have left it up to the ref's call. It shouldn't come down to whether a ref makes a call or not. I can never blame a ref on a game. That's the easy way out. And we had every opportunity to try and seal the deal.\"\nThe Seahawks had three chances to at least tie the deal in the final 20.6 seconds. Caitlin Shimko fired high on a free-position attempt. Jillian Burton got the ball and sent a shot wide left. Kennedy Kirby managed to get off one final shot that George got to and covered to secure the win.\n\"I'm not going to lie, I was nervous,\" George said. \"But I was keeping it composed. I was just telling myself, 'We got this. We got this.' We've worked so hard for this and it's all paying off.\nDecatur took a 1-0 lead on Ava Konyar's goal less than 3 minutes into the game. Queen Anne's tied it on Ensor's first goal with under 7 minutes to play in the first quarter. McDaniel made a huge point-blank stop on Pinder. But the Lions' senior attacker retrieved the ball and tucked a shot into the back of the net for a 2-1 lead with 5:05 left in the opening period.\nKauffman tied the game at 2-2 on a free-position chance 2:11 into the second. Riley Klepper pushed the Lions back in front less than a minute later. Kirby forged the game's third tie with 3:29 left in the first half. Ensor scored a free-position goal with 43.1 seconds to go in the half. Kauffman won the following draw, raced downfield, and after a few stick fakes put a sinker past George for a 4-4 halftime tie.\nBut the Lions goalie and her defense shut out the Seahawks over the game's final 17:50, including the chaotic final 20 seconds.\n\"That's Maddie George,\" Fitzgerald said. \"She comes out and that's her style of play. We forced a lot of girls to shoot the high shot and were on their sticks all night. Maddie at that point, when she's in situations like that, she's locked in and just doing anything she can. It might not be the most soundest thing but she's making sure that ball does not go by her body.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Weather conditions caused the school system to close for the entire day.\nDorchester County Public Schools also closed for the day due to icy road conditions. Caroline County Public Schools closed for students, but offices opened at 10 a.m. for its 12-month employees.\nEaston's Superintendent of Public Works Mike Dickerson said Easton Public Works used 46.92 tons of salt to keep the town's roadways safe. He said the department applied salt to the town's main roads — roads like Washington Street that get you into town — three times.\nAfter receiving a notification from the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, Easton Public Works began salting roads at 4 p.m. Monday. Dickerson said the last of the department's five trucks finished salting for the third time at 4:44 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\"We had five trucks out,\" he said. \"And each one of them has an assigned route.\"\nAccording to the National Weather Service, winter weather advisories for Queen Anne's, Talbot and Caroline counties were issued early Tuesday morning and in effect until 1 p.m. on Tuesday.\nThe advisories were for mixed precipitation with additional snow of up to an inch and ice accumulation of around one 10th of an inch. The advisories stated that morning commutes could be affected due to slippery road conditions.\nDorchester County received a winter weather advisory from the National Weather Service for freezing rain and additional ice accumulation. The advisory was in effect until 11 a.m. Tuesday morning.\nAs of noon on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, snow and freezing rain were likely in Easton before 1 p.m. with a chance of rain and snow between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and a chance of more snow after 2 p.m. Little or no snow accumulation is expected. A tenth of an inch of ice accumulation is possible.\nDickerson said Easton Public Works has its trucks prepared in the event that employees have to go back out to take care of the roads. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's the biggest thing I'm proud of. They're dogs.\"\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Kent Island (1-2) took a 3-0 lead on Spencer Chappell's 44-yard field goal with 7:06 left in the first half. The Buccaneers stretched that lead to 10-0, when running back Jaxson Hess caught a short pass from quarterback Trace Klapaska and broke a handful of tackles en route to a 52-yard touchdown 32 seconds before intermission. Chappell added the extra point.\n\"The speed of the game was really fast, especially for our quarterback and our offensive line,\" said Griffith, who watched quarterback Brady Walls battle pressure for most of the first half. \"They've got a great defense. They play fast, they play hard.\n\"Tim had a great game plan,\" Griffith added of Kent Island head coach Tim Goodrich. \"We've played each other so many times. He's got a lot of defenses you practice for. So even what they were doing we practice. But you can't simulate how hard and how fast they play. They gave us a helluva time in the first half.\"\nKent Island put the Warriors in a deeper hole with just under 8 minutes left in the third quarter, when fullback Alex Brestensky busted loose for an 87-yard touchdown jaunt that — together with another Chappell PAT — made it 17-0.\nEaston answered.\nThree Jamier Copper carries netted 26 yards. Horsey ran for 8 and 5 yards. Walls then connected with Kyree Acree for a 37-yard gain, setting up the first of Horsey's three TD runs, a 3-yard run up the middle. Stanco's first PAT made it 17-7 with 5:33 left in the third quarter.\nThe Bucs widened their lead to 20-7 with 1:26 to go in the third on Chappell's 42-yard field goal.\nKent Island maintained that 13-point cushion, when Easton took over from its own 20 with 7:13 left in the game. Walls hit Zach Barnhart for a 42-yard pickup, completed a 12-yard gain to Carter Mooney, then found Barnhart for a 21-yard to the 1. Horsey capped the drive, slamming in from the 1. Stanco's second PAT made it 20-14 with 6:03 to go.\nEaston forced a three-and-out and took possession at its 30 with 4:23 remaining. A 9-yard completion from Walls to Barnhart coupled with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Kent Island, moved the Warriors to Kent Island's 40.\nOn third-and-10, Walls dumped a short pass to Horsey for a 22-yard pickup. A Walls-to-Mooney connection pushed Easton to the Bucs' 6. Horsey carried for gains of 2 and 3 yards, before launching himself over the goal line from 1 to tie the game at 20-20 with 1:28 left.\n\"I felt like (NFL Hall of Fame running back) Emmitt Smith jumping over the pile,\" Horsey said of his tying touchdown.\nOn came Stanco to convert his third PAT of the game for a 21-20 lead.\n\"After I made the first (point-after) kick, got the nervousness out,\" Stanco said. \"Then I made the second and we got close. And then the game was on me; game was on the line. I had to put it through the uprights and I did.\"\n\"I was nervous for him,\" Griffith said of Stanco. \"We've struggled on our special teams this year. It was an emphasis this week that specials had to be perfect and we were pretty good tonight. That was big. He (Stanco) has a great leg. He's very talented. And so does Kai Ferraris. Both of them, very talented. They just need more reps and it's hard when they're soccer players.\"\nKent Island's Andy Bennett returned the ensuing kickoff 10 yards before slipping at the 25. Four incompletions later, Easton took over, with Walls taking a knee twice to complete one of the bigger come-from-behind wins over Griffith's career as head coach.\n\"Second half I think we wore them down a little bit and we hit some big plays,\" Griffith said. \"And that was the difference.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oxford moves $2 million from BayVanguard\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 607\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD - The Commissioners of Oxford voted to temporarily move $2 million from an account with BayVanguard Bank to the investment bank, Maryland Local Government Investment Pool, at a town meeting Tuesday.Of the three commissioners, Commissioner Susan Delean-Botkin voted against this decision to move the money for two weeks until Town Manager Cheryl Lewis can come back with a report on alternative investment options.With this report, the commissioners will be able to compare different rates and decide whether it makes sense to put the money back into BayVanguard Bank or keep it elsewhere.The money being moved is currently earmarked for temporary funding for capital projects, Lewis said. She said the town will be using it as cash flow and so that $2 million amount will fluctuate.Commissioner Katrina Greer, who made the motion to temporarily move the money, said investment pool is offering higher interest rates than BayVanguard Bank, which she said impacts the town's budget. She said MLGIP's rate is almost 5.4%, while BayVanguard is offering 4% rates.\"Heretofore, [BayVanguard Bank] had our $3 million to $4 million of regular checking accounts at an absurdly low rate at three-10ths of a percent,\" Greer said to Lewis during the meeting. \"And I realize you did get it moved up to 4%, but they really needed to step up to the plate.\" Greer talked about the ease of putting money into and taking money out of MLGIP.\"Because MLGIP is an instrument where it's completely liquid, we could put the funds in tomorrow and then we could take them out Thursday,\" she said.Lewis warned commissioners and the town about the possible consequences of taking the money out of Bay-Vanguard Bank. She said she understands the benefit of gaining interest, but said it could result in BayVanguard Bank closing its Oxford branch.\"We are about half of the investors in this branch,\" Lewis said, adding that it is very possible the bank will \"seriously consider\" closing the Oxford branch.\"Because it has been a conversation over the years,\" she said.Lewis said she thinks residents need to determine whether the branch is of value to them before a decision to move the money is made. Both Lewis and Greer agreed that public participation was necessary to make this decision.During the meeting, residents brought up different reasons for why it does or doesn't make sense for the town to move the money.Some residents said that while the branch is local, they don't consider BayVanguard Bank a \"community bank.\" Others brought up the fact that other banks in Easton are a short distance away.Multiple residents talked about how staying with BayVanguard Bank essentially leaves money on the table.\"I don't think there's anyone in this room who would not like to have a higher rate of return,\" Russ Gray said. \"No one.\" Gray asked if the town has gone to Bay-Vanguard Bank to see if they could match rates. Commission President Tom Costigan said this is a possibility. He said the commissioners have spoken with the bank and continue to speak with the bank.Resident Art Murr talked about the risk of pulling the money from BayVanguard's Oxford branch.\"You pull $2 million out of a branch, that branch manager, that branch itself, it has to account for that,\" he said. \"I understand how you can make more money. I really do get it.But let us not minimize the potential impact of what happens if you get rid of that.\" At the meeting Greer talked about possibly forming a finance and budget committee \"for better cash management.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nOxford Commissioner Katrina Greer discusses town finances at a Sept. 12 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget, Blueprint, energy are top issues for Shore legislators this session\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As Eastern Shore legislators prepare to cross the bridge and return to Annapolis for the first day of the Maryland General Assembly's 2025 legislative session on Wednesday, the state's budget is top of mind.\"It's just a tough time right now, and we're going to have to be very cautious and very thoughtful of the citizens and the impacts that our citizens are feeling,\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nThe state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Jacobs said when it comes to the budget process this year, he thinks everything will be on the table. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly — on the Shore — fiscal conservatives concerned with any cost increase, any tax increase or any cost toward citizens,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he hopes state Democrats realize that some state goals, such as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and some climate initiatives, are unrealistic and need to be reexamined.\n\"So I hope there's some reality checks,\" he said.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R- Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the state has overspent. He said although House leadership seems to be ok with raising taxes to balance the budget, the governor might not be \"comfortable\" with that.\nGhrist said he expects to see a \"clash\" in the Democratic Party regarding the budget.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) sees this legislative session as a \"defining\" one for Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\"He's going to have to balance this out within his own party,\" Mautz said about Moore. \"Because the policies that are in place now that have caused these economic problems largely come from the Democratic Party and Democratic leadership.\"\nBLUEPRINT FOR MARYLAND'S FUTUREThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is another issue that legislators on the Shore expect to be one of the top issues this legislative session.\nThe Blueprint — a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and education quality across the state — has garnered some concern across the state due to funding challenges.\nHutchinson said that with a budget shortfall, the state should be \"pulling back\" on the Blueprint. He said the plan has \"been devastating\" to counties across the state.\nJacobs said he thinks this legislative session will result in adjustments to the timeline of certain Blueprint goals.\n\"I don't think that they're going to do away with Blueprint by any means,\" he said. \"I just think that there may be some changes in the timeline of different parts of it.\"\nMautz said \"something has to happen\" with the Blueprint. He said he isn't sure if legislators will create bills \"to address the damage that's been done\" or create bills that put pauses on the plan.\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTFrom solar energy to electric vehicles, Eastern Shore legislators see energy and environment issues as important heading into this legislative session.\nGhrist called the state's renewable energy goals \"virtually impossible to achieve.\" He said he has concerns about who is controlling where solar energy systems are being placed in the state. He plans to put out \"several\" bills that address solar energy.\n\"Our number one industry is agriculture and it's being threatened right now by solar,\" he said.\nJacobs said he has heard that there have been some \"serious conversations\" about expanding nuclear energy in the state. He said he hopes state leadership and legislative committees that deal with energy issues will look more into nuclear energy and figure out if it's a direction the state should be going in.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Hutchinson said he doesn't think the state has the capacity for its electric vehicle initiatives.\n\"There's not enough power stations to be able to charge them,\" he said. \"And based upon what I'm hearing from our local dealers, there's not a market for them and they want to stay with combustible engines.\"\nHutchinson said he expects a lot of debate this session.\n\"And again, I hope that we see some reality coming that we can't continue to afford to spend and that we have to make sure we address this $2.7 billion short fall that's going to get worse and worse each year if we don't do anything today,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council vote on cannabis moratorium delayed - Tabled measure leads to heated discussion among council members\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A move by Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus to continue a hearing on a proposed cannabis moratorium drew strong reactions from other council members.A tense back-and-forth exchange between Gunsallus and Ward 3 Councilman David Montgomery toward the end of Monday's council meeting stemmed from the council president's executive decision to delay a vote on the moratorium for an additional three weeks.The nine-month moratorium on cannabis businesses, introduced this summer, was originally slated for a public hearing and vote at the council's Sept.18 meeting. The matter had been tabled until Monday so all five council members could be present to vote.The moratorium, if passed, would place a pause on applications, approval, construction, expansion, processing or issuance of building permits for a business that grows, processes or sells cannabis within the Easton town limits.The moratorium would also allow the town to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance.Easton's existing zoning ordinance already contains definitions and permitted zoning districts for medical cannabis dispensaries and growing and processing facilities, but does not include language on standards for recreational facilities.Montgomery strongly objected to Gunsallus' continuance, saying the council president did not have the authority to do so. Gunsallus affirmed that he did.\"Sir, you will contain yourself please,\" Gunsallus said, speaking over Montgomery, who started to make a comment.Gunsallus reaffirmed he had the power to continue discussion on the moratorium until the next meeting, explaining that he wanted to wait until the town's planning commission made an additional recommendation later in the week.However, in August, the commission unanimously gave a favorable recommendation to approve the ordinance.Montgomery called for a vote on the continuance, questioning Gunsallus' authority.\"The fact that four of us could reveal that we want to vote now means nothing to you, that you will override the wishes of the council because you are sitting there as the town council president,\" he said.Town Attorney Sharon Van Emburgh chimed in, saying the council can override the president's action. But in the past, the council has typically given members additional time to vote as a courtesy.Montgomery pointed out that the council had already given an additional month for consideration.Gunsallus reemphasized the upcoming planning commission meeting would provide more clarifying information.\"Excuse me, what information will that be?\" Montgomery said.\"(The planning commission's) recommendations, as I've stated, so please contain yourself - you've already spoken more than permissible,\" Gunsallus said.Montgomery motioned to overrule Gunsallus and vote on the ordinance as presented.Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello interjected, saying while he understood Montgomery and \"definitely\" disagreed with how the decision had been handled, he agreed that granting additional time to decide was in line with past council actions.Mayor Megan Cook, a former council president herself, interrupted the quarreling, calling for the councilmen to settle down.\"I agree that we are a group of five where you all are independent and you all have various opinions - absolutely.We must respect ourselves - the fighting, we need to\" she said, trailing off and moving her arms to motion to calm down.\"Please.\" Ward 4 Councilman Rev.Elmer Davis Jr. initially seconded the motion, rescinding his vote just minutes later to agree with Abbatiello's stance on the council's precedent. He voiced worry with how the situation was handled.\"We have never had such a dialogue that we had tonight regarding issues and concerns,\" he said. \"That dialogue - I'm quite concerned about things that have been said, I've never seen this on this council in all my days.\" The council will again table voting on the ordinance until its Monday, Nov. 6, meeting.Uncertainty still remains on the moratorium. During Monday's meeting, council members and town residents raised questions on the moratorium's duration, specifics on licensing for both recreational and medical facilities and zoning laws for both types of establishments.The Easton Planning Commission will discuss zoning requirements for adult-use cannabis dispensaries at its Thursday, Oct. 19, meeting. \n \n Caption: COURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Town Council President Frank Gunsallus pauses his comments during a tense moment at the Monday, Oct. 16 council meeting.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nWard 3 Councilman David Montgomery, left, prepares to make a comment during a tense exchange at a council meeting Monday, Oct. 16.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook gestures with her hands for the council members to settle down. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rebranded now, the staff aims to create an event enjoyed by the entire community.\nOne of the organizers Prakash \"Chikki\" Shajwani emphasized this point, \"We wanted to give back to the community. This is a way of getting kids outdoors and for families to get together.\"\nMarketing Director Sara Dion echoed his statements, mentioning the new vendors this year to do that: the decoy table, duck and goose call makers, and some fun activities for kids along with food trucks.\nUnder the tent with the callers and decoy makers, there was a wealth of information from experts of their craft, people willing to discuss their workmanship, honed from years of experience.\nLike Sean Mann the World Goose Calling Champion of Champions. He won championships for duck calling and for making his own calls.\nWorking beside his son, Ian, who shows his talent for making calls, Mann said he owed his career path to the late Dan Edwards, an instructor at Anne Arundel College and a good friend.\n\"He made the dream possible. Without him none of this would have happened,\" Mann said.\nThese awe-inspiring stories weren't limited to just the vendors.\nLooking at crossbows, Delaware resident Rene Swing casually mentioned how she once got a bear using a Horton Legacy crossbow, in a deer stand, in Maine.\nThese outdoor stories were all over the place, uniting residents and visitors.\nOutside the tent, children enjoyed climbing the bouncy castle, The Triple Shots 4-H crew taught kids archery and beside them was a BB gun range run by the National Wild Turkey Federation along with the Queen Anne's County High School Clay Target Team, ensuring proper safety.\nWith cold beverages and good food there was also a nice mix of local talented musicians entertaining while spectators sat on hay bales.\nThe Quinn Arnold Band played on Friday, Joe Bryan sang and strummed classics on Saturday, and newcomer Elena Barnett with musician Justin Singleton, closed out Sunday with country, blues and rock covers.\nFor three days Molly's was bustling with activity.\nDion said last year they drew approximately 15,000. They anticipated recording as many this year, if not more.\nShajwani showed appreciation to all the volunteers such as the Chestertown Lions Club for helping park cars, the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company selling beer, and the Maryland State Police for helping on that busy stretch of road navigating people who came as far as Virginia and Baltimore for the event.\nAnd he thanked the community recalling when the place was called Vonnie's noting how it was a hub for Marylanders to meet.\nWith their tagline, \"Fuel your adventure,\" Shajwani said Molly's shows that same appreciation to the location's history and the culture while making their own mark.\nDion said, \"We want to express our gratitude to the wonderful members of our community who attended the event and continue to support Molly's. Kent County holds a special place in our hearts, and we are honored to be part of this remarkable community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Biden butchered this decision': Democrats split over U.S. lifting ban on Paraguayan beef imports\n\n March 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: National \n \n 1037\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The six Democratic senators representing the Delmarva Peninsula voted against a measure that would reverse the Biden administration's decision to allow beef imports into the U.S. from Paraguay.The U.S. Senate voted 70-25 Thursday to reverse the administration's move to lift longstanding prohibitions on Paraguayan beef imports in an effort led by U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana.\nThe agricultural and trade battle has divided Democrats and comes as U.S. beef prices could hit all-time record highs this year with production inventories at their lowest levels since the 1950s.\nThe White House \"strongly opposes\" the reversal in an issue that has split Democrats saying it will undermine U.S. trade relations including with Paraguay which has taken pro-U.S. stances related to Russia and China.\nParaguayan beef imports that been prohibited into the U.S. for the past 25 years over concerns about foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reversed that ban in November.\nTester and other critics of the change — including U.S. farm groups — worry about impacts on U.S. food supplies.\nThe Senate vote saw Democrats split on the issue with 26 favoring reversing the Biden decision — Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York along with Tester and U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. The latter trio all face tough reelection bids in November.\nTwenty-two Democrats — including Maryland's Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, Delaware's Chris Coons and Tom Carper and Virginia's Mark Warner and Tim Kaine — sided with Biden's meat move.\n\"President Biden butchered this decision,\" said Tester, in a statemetn. \"By cutting corners to resume beef imports from a country with a recent history of foot and mouth disease, the Biden Administration is jeopardizing our food supply and giving Montana consumers and producers a raw deal. We cannot allow beef imports from Paraguay until we have data that shows they are meeting same high animal health standards as American ranchers, and I'm proud to have secured overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate to force the Biden administration to reverse course.\"\n'MUST BE HALTED'\nThe measure still needs to pass the U.S. House.\nMost Senate Republicans — including South Dakota'a Mike Rounds, Montana's Steve Daines and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — vote re-impose the Paraguayan beef ban.\nRounds was the prime GOP sponsor of the measure.\nU.S. agriculture and cattle industry groups — including the Livestock Marketing Association, National Farmers Union and R-CALF USA, also want Congress to nix the Biden administration's decision.\n\"The last time U.S. government officials stepped foot in a Paraguayan meat processing facility was in 2014. That nearly ten-year gap since the last site visit does not inspire confidence in Paraguay's animal health and food safety protocols,\" said Justin Tupper, president of U.S. Cattlemen's Association (USCA).\nThe group warns a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak (FMD) could cause as much as $99 billion in economic damages in the U.S.\nAgriculture groups in Tester's home state — including the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Farmers Union and Montana Stockgrowers Association — also backed the Senate measure.\n\"Until it can be absolutely proven that there is no risk of an infectious animal disease outbreak in the U.S. domestic animal population caused by these imports, they must be halted,\" said Cyndi Johnson, president of the Montana Farm Bureau.\nWHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK\nThe Biden administration issued a statement to Congress March 19 opposing the Tester and Rounds-led measure.\n\"The administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 62, which would disapprove of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) action to allow imports of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States. USDA conducted a rigorous scientific evaluation including site visits, a full risk analysis, and ongoing review of the region's animal health status and concluded that the risk of fresh beef imports from Paraguay is low,\" the White House said.\n\"If enacted, S.J. Res. 62 would undermine the credibility of long-standing science-based decision-making processes respected by the U.S. and upheld in our trade agreements, and could in turn severely threaten fair access to new and existing export markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers,\" the White House statement to Congress continued.\nThe U.S. administration said the measure would indefinitely ban Paraguayan beef imports and \"mark a significant setback in the United States-Paraguay bilateral relationship and U.S. credibility as a reliable economic partner across Latin America.\"\nThe White House said a pullback could have national security and geopolitical ramifications, pointing to Paraguay's condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and standing as the last South American country recognizing Taiwan.\nChina, in particular, has been making significant investments in Latin America and other developing regions. Russia restricted Paraguayan imports after the Ukraine rebuke.\nThe Biden administration was re-instituting a U.S. ban could send Paraguay into the economic arms of Moscow and/or Beijing.\n\"Access to the U.S. market is critical for Paraguay to recover exports lost to Russia and to withstand pressure from the PRC to withdraw diplomatic recognition of Taiwan,\" the White House contends.\nParaguayan beef imports would be a small slice of of the total U.S. market — 0.05% of the total market and 0.5% of imports, according to an October 2023 analysis by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA arm also defended its decision to ease the ban.\nRECORD HIGH BEEF PRICES?\nThe dustup over Paraguay beef imports also comes as U.S. beef production has been dropping and prices are on the rise.\nBeef and veal prices were up 7.4% in February compared to a year ago, according to the Consumer Price Index.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation said beef prices could hit record highs with supplies at their lowest since 1951.\nThe Farm Bureau said there were 87.2 million heads of cattle in the U.S. in January. That's down the 8.9% from four years ago and the lowest inventories in 73 years.\n\"Farmers have been driven to sell off cattle because of severe drought conditions and the rising cost of supplies needed to support their herds. There are now fewer female cattle available for breeding, which means it will take time to restock the cattle population, AFBF said in a statement.\n\"The latest cattle numbers are a stark reminder of the challenges facing America's farmers and ranchers,\" said AFBF President Zippy Duvall. \"Severe weather, high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty are taking a toll on farmers across the country, and families will see the effects in their grocery bills.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hosler at 100 and counting\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 693\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — As Queen Anne's County High's boys soccer team prepared for its victory jog across the field Wednesday night, a handful of Lions coaxed head coach Wade Hosler to find a place in line and join the run.Hosler made it halfway across the field then started applauding.\n\"It's senior night,\" he said. \"Let them have it.\"\nIt was also the night Hosler earned his 100th career victory, as Jamison Kendall's first-half goal proved enough in a 1-0 victory over a no-quit North Dorchester bunch, keeping the Lions atop the North Bayside.\n\"I guess it means I'm getting old,\" said a smiling Hosler of his milestone. \"I didn't really sit down and think about it too much. It's been a lot of tremendous players, a lot of great assistant coaches, administration. A lot of people have helped me along the way.\n\"It's been an amazing journey,\" continued Hosler, now in his 13th season at the helm. \"We have great kids. They come out and they work hard every year. We graduate good kids, and good kids fill their shoes. So it's a good place to be. If it wasn't I wouldn't have lasted this long.\"\nWith their fourth win in five games, the Lions (5-3 overall, 5-0 North Bayside) remained in first place in the division via their fourth one-goal win of the season.\n\"It's always a little stressful,\" Hosler said of senior night. \"We didn't finish the ball, which makes it difficult. We finish a couple more early (chances) and it would be a different game. But we don't put the ball in the back of the net and it becomes a struggle.\"\nQueen Anne's got four corner-kick chances in the opening 15 minutes but couldn't convert. And though the Lions controlled possession for much of the first half, the Eagles (4-4-1, 1-4-1) found openings and opportunities, the biggest coming with 26 minutes, 18 seconds remaining, when Christian Chase drilled a strike off the crossbar.\nThe Lions cranked up the intensity on the offensive end, with James Rath sending a pair of shots on goal that North Dorchester keeper Jayden Coleman stopped. But with just under 18 minutes left before half, the Lions worked the ball down the right side and over to Kendall, who steered a left-footed shot past Coleman for a 1-0 lead.\n\"We had good pressure,\" Eagles head coach Gabe Guzman said. \"It's one of those nights where things don't fall your way and you have to live with the results. Unfortunately, we had one mistake in the back end.\"\nQueen Anne's continued building chances toward padding its lead in the second half. Coleman stopped Trey Moore's header with 27:27 to go. Kendall was denied with 13:30 remaining and Rath unloaded a drive wide left 2 minutes later.\nNorth Dorchester pushed into the Lions end in the final 5 minutes in a bid for the equalizer. Senior captain Chris Sanchez, who booted a number of long clears and balls into the Queen Anne's end throughout the game, drove a direct kick wide left with a little over 5 minutes left. The Eagles got a corner with 3 minutes to go, but couldn't muster a shot.\nAbout a minute later, the Eagles sent a through ball into the box. But Lions sophomore keeper Braeden Livingston sprinted off his line and scooped the ball before anyone else could get a touch.\n\"It makes it stressful,\" Hosler said of his team's one-goal wins. \"But hey, we're playing well. We're still undefeated in the North. And I'm proud of the way we grind. It's not pretty. We're not finishing as many opportunities as we would like, but we keep grinding. We keep fighting. And we find a way to win.\"\nGuzman also liked his team's fight, and with a little work, hopes to be a force in the Class 1A East playoffs.\n\"We're still working things out,\" said Guzman, whose team is 4-1-1 against 1A competition this season. \"Finishing is still a little bit of an issue. It's a work in progress. Hopefully come playoff time we won't have that issue.\n\"Kudos to them,\" Guzman added of Hosler and Queen Anne's. \"Hundredth win. That's a wonderful feat. Hopefully one day I'll be there. But they did their job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Marylanders have saved $8.3 million on monthly internet bills statewide, according to the White House.\nThe Biden administration is pushing Congress to support an extension of the broadband program.\nPresident Joe Biden last October requested an additional $6 billion in funding for the program.\nLast month, he made public appeals for support in tweets.\n\"During the pandemic, we saw just how essential high-speed internet really was — from telemedicine, online school, and small business e-commerce to the ability of millions to work remotely and connect with one another when it wasn't safe to gather,\" Biden said.\n\"It's past time Republicans in Congress joined their Democratic colleagues and worked to pass funding for this essential program.\"\nA bipartisan effort by 17 senators to amend the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill to include $6 billion for the internet program failed Thursday. Senate leaders resisted efforts to include the program and other non-aviation-related amendments in the FAA measure.\n\"Congress must take action to save the ACP to lower costs for American families, boost the economy, and promote job creation and economic mobility,\" Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, said in a statement. He was the sponsor of the amendment.\nIn the House, 122 Democrats and Republicans on Thursday wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging action to preserve the discount internet program.\n\"While certain bipartisan reforms to the program are necessary to improve efficiency and effectiveness, it is the most vulnerable families across the nation that will bear the burden of our inaction if funding lapses,\" the lawmakers warned.\nThe program offers internet discounts of up to $30 a month for qualifying households and up to $75 a month for homes on tribal lands, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Also available is a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating internet service providers under conditions.\nA Baltimore-based Twitter/X user under the pseudonym\"Fearturnip\" tweeted in January about the program's pending expiration, saying, \"Not only is the national Affordable Connectivity Program tanking in April, the Maryland Broadband Benefit is also ending.\"\n\"I guess we're back to 'normal,' where the digital divide ravages America.\"\nOver 23 million households nationwide have benefitted from the program, according to the software company WhistleOut, with most of the program's beneficiaries being low-income, veterans, minorities, and seniors.\nMore than 77% of discount internet program users said losing their benefits would force them to change their internet plan or drop internet service entirely, according to an FCC survey last year.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, met with St. Mary's County leaders and county stakeholders last month to discuss his plans for keeping the internet accessible to low-income households and securing funding for the internet program.\nHoyer said he is committed to \"narrowing the digital divide\" and enabling everyone in Maryland's 5th District with internet access, according to the Lexington Park (Maryland) Leader.\n\"The Affordable Connectivity Program has transformed St. Mary's County and communities across the country,\" Hoyer said. \"Education, health care, and our economy rely on America's workers, students, seniors, and families being connected to the internet.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Federalsburg officials address town's mounting issues at public forum\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — The Federalsburg Town Council hosted hundreds of residents for a public forum at Federalsburg Elementary School Monday evening.Town officials wanted to set the record straight about town rumors, addressing issues like misappropriation of town funds, employee resignations, $5 million of debt, wastewater treatment issues and police department cost.\nA 50-minute explanation by the council members explained the root of these issues and the options and plans to solve them.\nDebt and staff accountability\nCouncil members revealed the town's $5 million of debt dates back to 1995.\n\"We did not get into a over $5 million debt overnight, but here we are and we're trying to clean it up piece by piece,\" council member Brandy James said. \"When I came on council, the math just didn't add up. So, looking into things, some of this debt goes back to 1995.\n\"The town has had a very historic past of one not paying bills on time, two robbing Peter to pay Paul, and three in order to get anything done instead of doing the right thing and figuring out how to better utilize the funds that were coming in, they would just take out loans or they would take out grants. Some grants were grants that the town wasn't even qualified for, but that's what they would do.\"\nJames said the town must pay back grants to grant providers because the grant providers have discovered that the town wasn't eligible to receive the grants. She said the town has lost grants because of not having audits done since fiscal year 2023.\nFederalsburg officials plan to establish a plan to pay off debt within 12 months using money from the town's general fund. The town has frozen spending and committed to a hiring freeze, except for a part-time code enforcement officer.\nAfter the hiring freeze, James said that the town will shift its employment focus to hiring staff who are qualified for their positions, no longer hiring employees based off relationships.\nWastewater and water issues\nCouncil member Darlene Hammond led the discussion on the fire department water usage. She said the town will not charge the fire department for water used to fight fires, but the fire house will be metered for non-emergency uses, which it previously has not been.\nThe town will install meters on hydrants to help track and detect leaks and start billing churches and other town serving companies for water and sewer usage.\nTown officials acknowledged past issues with inconsistent billing and old meters. They plan to take steps to clear billing statements and update account balances. They will explore tools for online payments and text alerts when bills are due.\nThe town's wastewater treatment plant was also discussed at the meeting. The facility was built to support a housing development in the town that was never constructed, making it outsized to the town's needs.\nMayor Kim Abner said the facility is built to handle 750,000 gallons a day, more than double the current usage of 350,000 gallons per day.\nThe town has many issues with taking care of the facility due to cost and improper usage.\n\"It costs a lot of money to fix the water main. It costs a lot of money to maintain the wastewater treatment plant,\" Abner said. \"There are state mandates that we have to deal with. We also need a new sludge press because the sludge press presses the water out, and if you don't press all the water out, you're paying more at the landfill. So, the wastewater treatment plant's a lot. It's a big investment. It's a lot of money, but we have to do it for safe drinking water and safe toilets.\"\nPolice Department\nCouncil member Ian Ferguson talked about the cost of the town's police department.\nIf the town were to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to provide policing services, it would save the town between $300,000 and $500,000, he said.\nThe town currently pays $1.146 million for the Federalsburg Police Department.\nSheriff Donald Baker told residents that the his would hire Federalsburg's police officers if it were to assume policing duties for the town.\nAccording to the Town Council, the current police station could be used as a substation for the Sheriff's Office if the town signs a memorandum of understanding.\nThe town plans to continue to have quarterly public meetings to keep the town informed on all issues and improvements. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The car did not stop, and a pursuit ensued.\nBody-worn camera footage was released from four officers: Talbot County Deputies Brittanie DiMichele, William Barnett and Owen Joseph, and Easton Police Department Officer Nicholas Lange.\nDiMichele led the pursuit as Joseph drove a second county police vehicle with Barnett in the passenger's seat. The driver of the car being pursued did not stop and continued to drive on Route 50. Officers pursued the vehicle for several minutes, sometimes reaching speeds over 100 MPH.\n\"We looked at our policy and we looked at the body-worn camera footage,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview. \"We listened to the dispatch record of our deputies as well as the communication behind the deputies, and our deputies followed proper procedure and policies.\"\nIn the video, officers can be seen taking a left turn onto Black Dog Alley just before stopping and exiting to approach the crashed vehicle at the 8300 block at 7:14 p.m.\n\"Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands,\" DiMichele shouted. The armed deputies asked for the people in the car to put their hands out the window.\nDiMichele approached the rear passenger door on the left side, slightly opening it as repeated asks for \"help\" can be heard from inside the car. The rear passenger pressed his hands on the window, as Barnett repeatedly asked the driver, a juvenile male, to stick his hands out the window.\n\"If you keep reaching, you're going to get shot if you pull something out, you understand me?\" Barnett said.\nGamble said it is \"totally appropriate\" for the officers to draw their weapons while approaching the vehicle.\n\"For their safety, they drew their weapons, ordered the people out,\" Gamble said. \"Once they realized the injuries and there was entrapment, then they holstered their weapons and tried to assist.\"\nBarnett asked the driver if he had any weapons, then began to attempt to help the driver exit the car at 7:16 p.m.\n\"We're here to help you now, okay, I need you to climb out this window,\" Barnett said.\nThe two rear passengers, a juvenile male and an adult woman, exited the car with assistance from the officers.\nOfficers were unable to extract the adult woman from the front passenger seat. \"She's just agonal,\" an officer said of her breathing. One officer noted she \"definitely wasn't wearing a seatbelt.\" EMS arrived on the scene at 7:22 p.m., the video shows.\nThe driver and the front seat passenger were transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The front seat passenger was later pronounced dead at the hospital, the attorney general's office said.\nThe decedent was previously identified as 18-year-old Yemaya Wilson.\nThe two rear passengers were transported to an area hospital for treatment of serious injuries.\nIn an August interview, Gamble said after the crash, police learned the vehicle had been stolen from Montgomery County.\n\"We suspect the criminal charges will be brought at some point in the case, against, at the very least, the driver of the stolen vehicle, if not more,\" Gamble said on Wednesday. \"But that's going to be in the hands of the (Maryland) State Police and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office.\"\nThe Independent Investigations Division will generally release body-worn camera and dashboard camera footage within 20 business days of an incident. The release of body-worn camera footage in this incident was delayed to allow additional time to conduct witness interviews, the Attorney General's Office said in a press release.\nThe Independent Investigations Division continues to investigate the circumstances of the fatal pursuit.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to include comment from the Talbot County Sheriff and more details about the event.{iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9msnyhxgddI?si=ryU7ae89GJOWvceC\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"}{/iframe} \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Despite no longer serving as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi is proof that power and influence in politics is not always based on a position.\nSome believe strongly that Pelosi played a key role, if not the key role in convincing Biden to abandon his re-election campaign.\nWhen asked if she helped apply pressure on Biden, Pelosi initially responded with, \"I didn't call one person.\" She later acknowledged she did make a call to one person and that was President Biden. On that call she opined that based on polling his re-election prospects were dismal and that would have significant negative impacts on Democratic candidates in competitive down ballot races.\nShe has also admitted she took calls from key Democratic Party power brokers and opinion leaders where she expressed the same concerns she raised on her call with Biden.\nWhen Nancy Pelosi talks about politics, most people listen. When she doesn't talk, most people notice her silence especially on matters like the viability of a Biden bid for a second term.\nNow that Biden has stepped down from running, she has been somewhat more forthright.\nAt a recent roundtable with reporters, she still insisted she did not lead a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure President Biden to drop his re-election bid. The operative word here is \"lead.\" While she may not have led those behind-the-scenes efforts there is increasing evidence she was very involved in them.\nLike so many past and present events in politics, we may never get the full story.\nWe do know that this chain of events reinforces the brutal reality of politics. Whenever a candidate becomes unelectable, they become expendable.\nUltimately, who Pelosi called or did not call, did or did take calls from, exactly what was said or not said on any of those calls, a mission she was involved to some degree to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee became mission accomplished.\nAchieving that mission formerly viewed by many as \"mission impossible\" has been a game changer in the 2024 presidential election and beyond. It has energized, galvanized, and mobilized a previously despondent Democratic Party. It increases the odds for Democrats to control at least one or both houses of Congress starting next year.\nIt has also forced the Trump campaign to explore adjustments to a campaign strategy that did not ask the question — what if Biden is not the opponent?\nThis change is not without some residual turbulence in the Democratic Party.\nPolitico recently reported Biden is angry with Nancy Pelosi. Their report includes the following quote from an anonymous senior White House official: \"Biden views Pelosi as 'ruthless' and willing to set aside long-term relationships in order to keep her party in power.\"\nAs a result, Pelosi has said she and Biden have not spoken since July 19.\nBased on the late scheduling and even later delivery of Biden's speech at the DNC convention it is clear the Democratic Party has no time for him going forward.\nI suggest Joe Biden needs to heed advice attributed to former Democratic President Harry Truman: \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Singing Captains to lead Buffett celebration at The Mainstay\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 552\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Jimmy Buffett was a musical legend with a phenomenal career and a unique following, but on the Chesapeake Bay, he was just another boater looking for good fishing, good food and good times.Well, maybe not just another boater. When Last Mango, his 42-foot custom sportfisher, made its way north to Sag Harbor in the spring, or south in the fall to the tropical climes that inspired many of his songs, Buffett delighted in exploring the bay from the ocean to the C&D Canal. He even filmed a music video at Thomas Point Light on one of the trips.\nBoaters, beach bums and backyard pool drifters all lost a friend when Buffett died at 76 on Sept. 1, 2023, due to complications from a rare form of skin cancer.\nTo honor the Labor Day weekend anniversary of his passing, and to celebrate his musical legacy, the Singing Captains are performing a Buffett-only concert of his hits on Sunday, Aug. 31, from 4 to 6 p.m. at the outdoor amphitheater of Rock Hall's iconic music venue, The Mainstay.\nIt will be a \"family-friendly celebration of music, memories and Margaritaville vibes, with special musical guests and good company,\" according to Mark Einstein, a member of the Singing Captains and a day-job charter boat captain in his own right.\nThe event is ticketless and free to the public, with a suggested donation of $10 to help The Mainstay continue its mission of providing a wide variety of musical offerings for the community. The Mainstay cash bar will be operating, with margaritas and more. Ice cream will be available for purchase from Get the Scoop, and That Place on Main will have Cheeseburgers in Paradise on the menu at the show.\nOpening for the Singing Captains, and joining them on a number of Buffett songs that follow, will be steel pan virtuoso Trevor Stubbs. He is a native of Trinidad, where the instrument was first fashioned out of industrial steel drums. Stubbs, who is one half of the duo Island Vibes, has played at The Mainstay previously. Beginning with the song \"One Particular Harbor,\" a 1983 release from the album of the same name, Buffett often used steel pannists on his Caribbean-flavored songs.\n\"What connects Rock Hall to the Jimmy Buffett thing is that this is a premier sailing and boating town. We've all got Hawaiian shirts, and we like to emulate that laid-back lifestyle that his music captured,\" Einstein said. \"His music, when it burst on the scene, influenced the whole boating world. You would hear it walking down literally any dock.\"\nBuffett, originally from Pascagoula, Mississippi, made his way to New Orleans and Nashville before discovering that Key West was just the right latitude for his attitude, and the tropical-tinged hits followed quickly. Over the course of his career, Buffett sold more than 20 million records, and 17 of his albums were either gold or platinum in sales. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.\nThose attending the Buffett celebration at The Mainstay will find plenty of seating at the open-air amphitheater, but if so inclined, there is room on the lawn for beach chairs, too. Visitors can bring those, wiggle their toes in the grass and pretend it is sand.\n\"Wear your loudest shirt and come help us toast Jimmy,\" Einstein said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury finds Tilghman man guilty of child sexual abuse\n\n November 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 732\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - After roughly five hours of deliberation Thursday, a Talbot County jury found a Tilghman man guilty on all but one count relating to the sexual abuse of a child earlier this year.The jury found Eric L. Werner guilty of 16 counts, including sexual abuse of a minor, third-and fourth-degree sex offenses, second-degree assault and displaying obscene matter to a minor.However, the jury did not convict Werner on one count of sexual abuse of a minor.The verdict comes after a four-day jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court.The child's mother, whom the Star Democrat is not naming to protect the victim's privacy, expressed gratitude for the guilty verdict.\"Justice has been served today,\" she said in an email. \"We can't thank the Talbot County Sheriff's (Office), and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office enough for their dedication to this case and the support that they've given my daughter and our family these past 8 months.\" She continued: \"I'd also like to express how important it is that parents, and guardians educate themselves and their children on the statistics and signs of sexual abuse and grooming. Empower your kids to speak up if someone is hurting them, being inappropriate with them, or making them feel uncomfortable. If your child discloses abuse to you, believe them, support them, and report the abuse to authorities or a mandatory reporter.\" \"What happened to my daughter was horrible, but it could have been a lot worse if she had not spoken up when she did.She will carry this trauma with her for the rest of her life, but we all hope that because she spoke up, it will help encourage another child to do the same and stop their abuse.\" Defense attorney Philip Cronan said he was disappointed in the verdict, but would see what comes next with sentencing, which is yet to be scheduled.Detectives from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office began investigating Werner, 61, in February after learning of multiple child sexual abuse incidents that occurred at a home in Tilghman that month.Police investigation revealed that Werner sexually assaulted a preteen girl through inappropriately touching her on three different occasions in February.Werner showed the child pornographic videos, which the child remembered in detail during the trial. Police testified to a specific adult website appearing in Werner's phone's search history.In closing arguments Thursday, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel highlighted the testimony and evidence presented during the trial as concrete proof that Werner established an inappropriate relationship with the child, grooming her, she said.Numerous text messages between the two, plus the child testifying to Werner initiating sexual conversations with her, further illustrated the inappropriate relationship, Endzel said.Later, Werner, asking the child to delete messages, indicated that he continued to coax the child into becoming comfortable with sexual contact, she added.Endzel also pointed to recordings of calls Werner made to his wife while in the county jail as additional corroboration for his guilt. During one call, Werner said the truth would get him \"into some trouble.\" And during another, he attempted to discredit her, telling his wife they needed to give a reason why she would lie, Endzel said.Countering the prosecution, Cronan acknowledged that the allegations against Werner would bother any juror, but questioned what the prosecution presented as facts.A point of contention between both attorneys Thursday morning was whether or not Werner had permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of the child - criteria that needed to be met to move forward with the sexual abuse of a minor charges.Though Talbot Circuit Judge Stephen H. Kehoe ruled that the prosecution had provided evidence demonstrating that Werner had temporary responsibility for the child during the incidents, Cronan still questioned if there was a change in responsibility between adults during his closing arguments.Cronan also questioned the consistency of the child's statements made to police compared to what she testified to on the witness stand, urging the jurors to find Werner not guilty if they only thought he \"probably\" or \"maybe\" touched the child inappropriately.In her final remarks to the jurors, Endzel said the child had no incentive to lie. She turned attention back to Werner, again highlighting his request for the child to delete text messages and pointing to the jail calls attempting to discredit her story.\"If that's not consciousness of guilt, I don't know what is,\" she said. \n \n Caption: ERIC WERNER \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

County Manager Clay Stamp vouched for the 1-cent resolution funding.\n\"In the last number of years, this additional funding has allowed us to see the best of our services,\" said Stamp, who is also the county's former emergency services director. \"We've stabilized our workforce. We've been able to attract quality individuals as paramedics, correctional officers, deputy sheriffs. We've enhanced our technology, we've enhanced our coverage.\"\nThe original resolution from 2020 amended the charter for five years up until July 1, 2026. Resolution 359, which was passed Tuesday, adds an additional seven years.\nOriginally, Resolution 359 was introduced as extending five years. Council Vice President Pete Lesher proposed an amendment Tuesday to tack on the two additional years.\nHis reasoning for the amendment was to ensure any future extensions can be voted on by the public during presidential elections, when the ballot is more \"uncrowded\" than other elections. County council and gubernatorial elections are set to be in 2026 and 2030, meaning that if extended to only 2031, the 1-cent question may have appeared on a crowded 2030 ballot.\n\"By adding another two years, rather than having this expire in a council election year (or) a gubernatorial election year, this will extend it to the next presidential election year so that should this need to be renewed another time, it can be done when there isn't such a crowded ballot,\" Lesher said.\nCouncil members unanimously approved the amendment 4-0 before passing the resolution by the same vote, with Council Member Dave Stepp absent.\nSparks said she's seen where the additional tax revenue has been spent, which is in \"the areas that the public has supported,\" noting the new positions and increased funding to volunteer fire departments.\n\"It's very important for the public to know that they're doing good things to help us,\" Council President Chuck Callahan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black watermen’s monument proposed for Wells Cove\n\n September 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The Queen Anne's County Commissioners approved Wells Cove as the site for a proposed Black watermen's monument Aug. 26, further representing the history and legacy of the county's iconic industry.Tilghman Hemsley, a Queenstown artist and director of American Patriotic Monuments Inc., who created the original Kent Narrows watermen's monument 20 years ago, said he had been approached about the lack of Black representation in that project.\nSeeking commissioner approval to establish the new monument on county property at Wells Cove, Hemsley presented mock-ups of the detailed sculptures.\nSymbolizing the rich heritage of Black watermen, the monument will depict life-size bronze sculptures featuring a conversation between a head boat captain and an oyster boat worker, according to Hemsley. The piece will also feature other important aspects of the industry, including a man working with clams, a woman picking crabs, another cleaning fish, as well as a young boy with a fishing pole along for the experience.\n\"It's a sculpture that leans into the whole industry,\" Hemsley said.\n\"The piece is designed for the public to be able to come through and be part of the sculpture,\" he said.\nWith the history of the Black watermen engraved into the side of the pieces, \"it's all about education,\" he said.\nThe monument is slated for a location between Bridges Restaurant and the Jetty restaurant. Hemsley emphasized the interactive nature of the work, allowing visitors the opportunity to pass between the pieces and engage with the sculptures as they visit the local area.\nThe watermen will be life-size bronze sculptures while the boat pieces will be stainless steel and powder-coated, he said.\nHemsley said the design of the pieces should make the monument low maintenance.\nThe project has already received approval from the Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation Department and a letter of recommendation from the Kent Narrows Foundation, he said.\nThe commissioners unanimously approved Wells Cove as the site for the proposed monument. Commissioner Jim Moran noted he would have preferred a competition among artists to design a tribute to Black watermen but supported the plan.\nHemsley noted time is of the essence if the statue is to be ready by July 4, 2026, in celebration of the country's 250th anniversary.\nServing as director of the project, Hemsley said various other artists will be involved in the sculpture work. The proposed monument has an advisory committee that includes watermen, he said.\nWith commissioner approval, the next steps include seeking funding grants, according to Hemsley.\nAlthough highly appreciated, just like the original watermen's monument, the project would not be solely dependent on county support, he said.\nThe total cost for the project is estimated at about $475,000. The previous watermen's monument cost about $300,000, he said.\nStatues typically take about three years to complete, but Hemsley was confident as long as funding came through.\n\"It's aggressive, but we can do it,\" he said.\nA fundraising event with auctions, games and music will be held at the Kent Island American Legion Nov. 8 starting at 7 p.m., he said.\nHemsley is also working with the Centreville Veterans Information Committee to create a life-size statue honoring the more than 400 Black soldiers of Queen Anne's County who fought for the Union during the Civil War.\nWorking with Chesapeake Charities, the veteran statue committee has been hard at work establishing itself as a nonprofit, according to John Wright, statue committee chair.\nWright credited the enthusiasm of the committee in working to establish a historic monument.\n\"I'm glad I am in a position to help,\" he said.\nWith the sculpture to be completed in stages, the committee foresees about a year and a half before a statue stands in front of the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center.\nDonations can be sent to United States Colored Troops Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 42, Centreville, MD 21617.\nAs a Maryland nonprofit, American Patriotic Monuments Inc. seeks to lead public arts projects and monuments that celebrate American legacies.\nMore information, including sponsorship opportunities, can be found at apmiart.org.\nInformation about Hemsley's work can be found at tilghmanhemsleyfinearts.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the story, farmer Abe allows Donkey (the chicken) to not only sit on chicken eggs, but also duck eggs.\nWell, Donkey ends up with a new lease on life, and when those ducks hatch, she cares for those ducklings like they are her very own.\nFarmer Abe learns a valuable lesson from that. If a chicken can learn to love something so different, he can love people different from him too.\nAnd \"writer Abe\" can instruct people that a chicken and duck cannot interbreed, and the chicken is simply incubating the duck eggs then loving the ducklings as her own.\nThis kind of love transcends, and is repeated again in Abe's second book: \"Moo Moo the Dog Adopts a Baby Pig,\" published in December 2023.\nThe theme is, you guessed it, Moo Moo the dog taking care of a baby pig, even more different than a duck and a chicken, and offers another powerful lesson about acceptance to Farmer Abe.\nKey's third book, \"Kitty the Goat and the Puppy\" has been delayed in shipment, but he is hoping for an Easter release. For his other books, you can find them on Amazon and some local book stores or contact him directly.\nThis time around Farmer Abe will learn from Kitty the goat, taking care of a puppy.\nThe story goes, Kitty the goat lives on a farm. He's a prize goat, but retires and like many in the limelight, gets depressed. And like many of us, depression gives way to mischief. Kitty is eating up the flower beds and gnawing on the clothesline as goats often do.\nWhat breaks Kitty from those bad habits is raising a little puppy, and through this puppy, Kitty finds purpose again.\nThe lesson?\nChoose love.\nIt's a lesson that resounds with many readers to the joy of Keys, especially in schools where love and acceptance is a key focus, he said.\nWriting with no expectations, his first book did amazingly well. Within weeks of publishing he had schools waiting to buy 300 books and since then has sold 3-4,000 copies of the book.\nHis foray into writing began with a challenge from friends, and he is glad he went through with it, Keys said. Finding a local artist to complement his stories, he discovered a very special niche combining children's books and agriculture along with a message of love and acceptance.\nWith plenty of source material too, drawing from his family owning farmland in Canada, South America and Montana, he's creating the fourth book, where the animal theme will continue. The last book of the series will explore Farmer's Abe's past with a very special horse.\nKeys success has continued to grow. He has been featured in four newspapers, including a story in Montana the place of his birth, a paper in Canada, and television broadcasts in Salisbury, Maryland in addition to being invited to several local schools.\nAs many story tellers will say, there are all kinds of ideas running around in his mind, but he is focusing on finishing out the series first.\nAnd he is honing his craft, drawing inspiration from others like Jay Miletsky, author of 14 books including \"Ricky the Rock Who Couldn't Roll.\"\nKeys will further challenge himself as he prepares to attend his first writer's summit in Nashville, Tennessee. He will have the chance to connect with fellow authors, pitch his ideas to professionals and learn from longtime experts.\nThrilled with the possibilities ahead, he takes with him lessons from his latest book. \"Farmer Abe was reminded that when given the chance, to always choose love. Because you just never know if the love you give to others might also change your life forever,\" Keys wrote.\nBased on his whirlwind author's journey so far, it seems like he's on to something rather special.\nFor information about his books, Keys encourages you to contact him directly at 410-708-5164, or find him on Facebook under Abraham Keys. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland legislators kick off 447th General Assembly\n\n January 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 670\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — With snow piled up around the Statehouse, Maryland lawmakers returned to downtown Annapolis for the 447th General Assembly on Wednesday.More than 560 bills were prefiled in either the House of Delegates or Senate prior to the opening session. While both chambers began introducing bills Wednesday, the focus largely remained on the state's looming budget deficit that will be tackled in the coming weeks.\nThe state is predicted to face a $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Gov. Wes Moore (D), who some Republicans have criticized for his fiscal decisions, must submit his balanced budget proposal by next Wednesday.\nLeadership in the House and Senate acknowledged the deficit will be center stage but spoke optimistically about what's ahead.\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat from Baltimore County, said the House, which reviews the budget first, will \"use it to reflect our values.\"\n\"As we begin this session, I know there has been a lot of talk about our financial limitations. And there should be,\" Jones said. \"We can't deny our difficult fiscal reality. But instead of talking about what our budget can't do, I'd like to talk about what it can do. Most importantly, our budget has the power to protect the most vulnerable Marylanders.\"\nJones noted health care and transportation as areas that will continue to be prioritized, as well as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive education initiative.\n\"We don't want to talk about cuts and prioritizing programs, but we have to,\" Jones said. \"We don't want to talk about high-energy costs, but we have to. And we have to talk about protecting the investment we made for our students and teachers in The Blueprint.\"\nSenate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat beginning his sixth year in the role, said the General Assembly's efforts to fund and facilitate reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge last year showed the aptitude of Maryland's lawmakers.\n\"This institution showed exactly who it is,\" Ferguson said. \"Within days, we had put together legislation working with our House counterparts, with the governor, setting up the PORT Act in a bipartisan way to find ways to put resources immediately to use, to set the state up for success in the midst of crisis.\"\nFerguson said the budget deficit is the General Assembly's next significant challenge.\n\"I've been thinking about it a little bit differently recently, in that yes it is a challenge, but really, it's an opportunity for us in this body,\" Ferguson said. \" … What do we want our future to look like? How do we take this challenge and have the hard conversations about what do we prioritize to invest in people and to build communities in a way that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\nThe Senate president offered positivity through the fact that the state came in under budget and ahead of schedule on a significant project just outside of the Statehouse — the Maryland Department of Legislative Services building. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held tomorrow, he said.\n\"What emerged was everything that the state of Maryland should look like,\" Ferguson said of the new building that he called \"beautiful.\"\nLeadership in both chambers remained the same Wednesday. Ferguson and Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine, a Democrat from Prince George's County, were unanimously nominated to their positions.\nIn the House, Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein, a Baltimore County Democrat, was nominated and approved for a second consecutive year. Jones begins her sixth full term as speaker.\nOn Wednesday, the House Speaker reflected on the fact that her first job in public service was made possible by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, legislation the late President Jimmy Carter extended during his time in office.\n\"I know that we all love public service,\" Jones said. \"And when I think about public service, I think about the late President Jimmy Carter. As it turns out, I owe a lot to President Carter.\"\nJones said those are the ways in which \"government can do powerful things for regular people.\"\n\"Progress isn't linear, it's incremental,\" Jones said. \"It takes time. It takes resilience.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Highs are expected to remain in the 90s later in the week across Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties.\nThe Dorchester County Health Department is encouraging people stay out of the sun when temperatures peak in the late mornings and early afternoons.\nA press release from the department noted the following groups should take added precautions: babies, young children, pregnant women, older adults, outside workers and those without air conditioning.\nLocal health officials recommend regularly hydrating, limiting time outdoors and monitoring for signs of heat exhaustion — heavy sweating, cold skin, cramps, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, etc.\nThe Maryland Department of Health said in a press release this week that Maryland saw 26 heat-related deaths last year. The state department added that parents and guardians should never leave children in cars.\n\"Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases — and confirm that they have the resources they need to stay safe during the hottest months,\" said Maryland Secretary of Health Dr. Meena Seshamani in the release.\nEASTON FIRE PREPARES\nAs temperatures heat up, volunteer fire departments across the Mid-Shore remain on call. Due to the physically intensive work of firefighting and the heavy gear that must be worn, some departments are asking for water donations from the community.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson says his department has received enough cases of water from thoughtful community residents and businesses to get through next week's heat wave. Dobson is encouraging residents to contribute to other fire departments in need in Talbot County.\nWhether it's lending bottled waters or assisting with manpower on a call, Dobson says local fire departments work together well.\n\"The other fire chiefs talk a lot, and we're always here to help one another,\" Dobson said.\nThe fire chief noted that as farmers in the area start to cut their wheat, field fires could pop up, a risk fire officials are keeping their eyes on.\nWeather projections are accurate as of Friday afternoon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Diggs said they need donations and are optimistic to reach the goal, but they also need volunteers for the shelter: some cooks, but more importantly they need hosts and sleepers. The host, Diggs explained, meets and greets the guests, ensures they are comfortable and safe while the sleepers stay the whole night.\nDiggs announced this year they are aiming to open the shelter in December, a first.\nThat is up to the amount of volunteers that sign up. Diggs said that they have to have 85% of December filled to accomplish this, with volunteers especially needed Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's.\n\"Let's make this month a recruiting month. Help us do it because I think we certainly can. We're excited to be able to add December and maybe next year, add another month.\"\nAs winter approaches, the need increases to care for Kent County's homeless population he stated.\nAs their mission describes, the Samaritan Group of Kent County work with local agencies, churches, businesses and organizations and individuals to keep them warm and also providing financial assistance.\nDuring the rally with refreshments and ice cream served by Marcia Stoltzfus and family, Diggs listed the shelter's accomplishments and gave out certificates and awards to the hardworking, caring volunteers which make it possible each year, adding a fun family event along the fundraising.\nIn the early winter months of 2025, they served 21 clients, seven women, two children and 12 men, 661 bed nights total. In 2018 they served 21 people as well, 1,033 bed nights and that next year, 28 people and 921 bed nights.\n\"The number of people we serve is unpredictable. We just don't know from year to year. The point is to be ready and all of you volunteers make that possible.\"\nHe thanked some of the volunteers that helped get the shelter ready.\nReceiving the Laverne and Shirley Award was dynamic duo Annie Woodall and Andrea Nieman. Top Chef, and also supplying that tasty soft serve ice cream was Marcia Stoltzfus and family. The Host with the Most was Allison Brieske and Volunteer of the Year, who dedicated time cooking/ inspiring her whole church to cook, and hosting, was Anne-Marie Walters.\nMany other certificates given as well, some of whom were not in attendance.\n\"They may not be here, but they were when it counted,\" joked Diggs.\nGiving her testimony about the rewards of volunteering was Melanie Keller, who was recruited by Woodall and Nieman years back and was the volunteer coordinator for a time.\nKeller said that after her third child, part of what kept her volunteering was her two children who also volunteer. They play hide-and-seek with guests and see other people's experiences, their suffering and joys and practice reaching out with compassion.\n\"We are a community and I hope to see some of you as hosts,\" she told attendees.\nDiggs said hosts have a very important role, stay from 5:30-10 p.m. and are in pairs. Diggs personally greets the hosts each night and briefs them on what they need to know, ensuring they are comfortable.\nSleepers stay into the night and see guests off in the morning.\nDiggs encouraged the audience to not only sign up but to become recruits, sharing the joys of volunteering at the shelter where Mid-Shore Community Foundation, United Way of Kent County, the Good Neighbor Fund and Kent County Department of Social Services partner in this important mission.\n\"We need your help,\" Diggs said to the community. \"With it we can open up in December...one month at a time.\"\nTo contact them go to: info@samaritangroupofkentcounty.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He spoke to real impacts of authoritarian governments of the past, but also to those currently taking hold, around the world and potentially, right here in America.\nLarry's thoughts, observations and quotes, particularly this one, from Trump, himself, \"I will be a dictator but only for a short time\" should give all Americans reason to carefully consider who steers Good Ship America in the upcoming four years.\nWe do not have to rely on what other people say about who, or what, Trump is; he, himself, tells everyone that tunes in to national media many opportunities to hear it, directly from his own mouth. Granted, there are many, many other media outlets and pundits that will spin who and what he is, and what he will do for you, if you vote to elect him. However, many of the promises he made during his first presidential run, were never fulfilled, for example:\nI'll build a great wall and Mexico will pay for it. NOPE.\nI'll repeal Obamacare and give you better, cheaper health care, NOPE.\nI'll bring manufacturing back to America, NOPE. Under his watch manufacturing jobs remained relatively flat, until they fell off the cliff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'll grow the economy by 4% per year, NOPE. Actually, his best year was 2018, when the economy grew by 2.9% over the previous year.\nI'll cut taxes for everybody, NOPE. While many, but not all, benefited, marginally, from Trump's tax cuts, the vast majority went to the rich and to corporations, some of them not even American.\nI'll terminate Obama's executive orders on immigration, NOPE. While one program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, (DACA), was challenged in our courts, it remains in effect, yet today. A second program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), never was implemented, so Trump could not terminate it.\nIf you listen to Trump now, he is regurgitating some of the same promises he failed to fulfill during his first term in office, even though he enjoyed Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate for his first two years in office. Which brings me to a word, or two, of caution to those who choose to vote in the upcoming elections.\nBe careful of those who don't keep their promises and be careful of the would-be dictator you vote to elect; you don't always get the kind of dictator you think you will, when you voted, based on what he and his minions tell you, and it is very hard to get rid of dictators.\nWILLIAM C.

They say it is and always has been the way of the world in which we live.\nIt has also been said that the public should not be surprised or upset when details emerge on behavior by elected and appointed government that is illegal or unethical.\nOthers have said illegal and unethical behavior is never acceptable.\nThey say the media has an obligation to report it, and those who engage in such behavior must be held accountable and punished to the maximum extent of the law.\nSome have said, while such behavior is bipartisan, more often than not, it is overlooked or excused by some of the national media when it involves Democratic presidents.\nThey cite the levels of reporting by the national media on Bill Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky, compared to Richard Nixon's involvement with Watergate.\nUntil recently, Nixon has been almost universally viewed as the least ethical and least honest president in U.S. history.\nJohn Kass, a former Chicago Tribune political reporter and columnist has challenged that view by writing \"… this one about Biden is much worse than the Watergate break-in. In that one the White House covered up the lawbreaking and the media uncovered it.\"\nEven Jake Tapper has suggested that may be true in saying publicly, the \"cover-up of the former president's mental decline may be a worse scandal than Watergate.\"\nWith that in mind, Congressional investigations are already underway on Biden's levels of awareness of and involvement on decisions made during his presidency.\nMore are likely to come.\nIt will be most interesting to learn answers given under oath to three questions:\nWas there at any point during the Biden presidency, when, as a result of Biden's physical and mental health conditions, decisions that are the exclusive responsibility of an elected president were instead made by an individual or individuals other than the elected President?\nIf so and perhaps without President Biden being aware of it, did these individuals break the law, that is, by using autopen signatures on executive orders and pardons?\nWas the media complicit if they ignored or did not follow-up with due diligence on these matters?\nOther questions will not be answered until next year's midterm elections.\nHow many decisions were made by voters based on their support for or opposition to President Trump's agenda?\nHow many decisions were made on whether or not there was conclusive evidence of a coverup of President Biden's levels of engagement during all four years of his presidency?\nWill the latter reflect an increasing loss of voter confidence in national news media outlets?\nThere are already signs of significant loss in that confidence in some of the national media.\nTapper's own CNN show had its lowest-rated month since August 2015. That should put every member of the news division of the national media on notice.\nThere are measurable and profound consequences on ignoring and disrespecting what Americans expect from national political news providers.\nGoing forward, American voters deserve three things from the national media.\nFact-based news with no hidden agendas.\nVigorous pursuit and continuous exposure of verifiable unethical and/or illegal behavior by every elected and appointed government official.\nNo group think — a psychological phenomenon when conclusions are not the result of a lack of information, but because of a conscious decision to put conformity above critical thinking.\nUntil that happens, all the excuses and explanations from the national media who failed to do their job during the Biden presidential years will be nothing more than too little, too late. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County diversity training, statement stir dialogue\n\n February 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Life \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A resolution to repeal Talbot County's diversity statement elicited strong reactions from the community over the weekend.While the Talbot County Council had its Tuesday meeting canceled due to impending snow, the resolution requested by Council Member Dave Stepp caught the eyes of many residents and organizations when it appeared on the meeting agenda.\nTina Jones, chair of the Demarva Pride Center, said the organization's board discussed it Sunday. Jones said the center opposes a potential repeal of the diversity statement.\n\"One of the things that our government is supposed to be is representative of all people, and that includes people in marginalized communities,\" Jones said.\nThe resolution's title on the agenda states that it would repeal two 2020 resolutions \"regarding diversity training and development of a Talbot County diversity statement, respectively.\"\nThe first 2020 resolution implemented an annual report of diversity training opportunities offered to staff. The second facilitated the creation of Talbot County's diversity statement, which is now found in its employee handbook.\nThe statement defines diversity, equity and inclusion, explains its purpose and details the county's approach to ensuring diversity. It also outlines how employees can report discrimination.\nStepp, who joined the council in 2022, confirmed to The Star Democrat that he is bringing forward the new resolution.\n\"I certainly think there's a lot of folks that are out there that are trying to make this something that it isn't,\" Stepp said in an interview. \"It's all financial in nature.\"\nIn a letter written to residents Tuesday, Stepp stated the resolution's purpose is to keep Talbot County \"in good standing with the federal agencies providing funds\" to the county. He said it's not an attack against the county's diversity and inclusion.\nStepp's letter makes mention of President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs in the federal government.\n\"What this proposed resolution will do is protect the Talbot County taxpayer from potentially not receiving the millions of dollars Talbot County already receives annually from the Federal Government,\" Stepp wrote.\nFormer Talbot County Council President Corey Pack brought forth the initial resolutions in the summer of 2020. In an interview Tuesday, he said the diversity statement was meant to \"memorialize\" what the council was already doing regarding diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce.\nPack hopes any attempt to repeal fails and said he's disappointed the council may be looking to remove the statement.\n\"Put your money where your mouth is,\" Pack said. \"If this is what you are about as a governmental body, what's wrong with putting that in writing? If you are a governmental body that believes in diversity, that believes in inclusion, that believes in equality, what's the fear?\"\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher was on the council when the two resolutions were passed in the summer of 2020. He said he hasn't noticed anything that would lead him to \"try to attempt to remove them.\"\n\"I've gone back and read over the language of the diversity statement, and I can't imagine what in there anybody would find objectionable,\" Lesher said in an interview.\nLesher added that he's worried removing the diversity statement could hurt the recruitment and retention of county government staff.\n\"I don't know that somebody would come here on the basis of whether or not we have these statements,\" he said, \"but the publicity of actually proactively removing such a statement might send a signal that some people aren't welcome here.\"\nBefore Tuesday's meeting was canceled, groups such as the Delmarva Pride Center and Talbot County Democratic Forum encouraged members to attend the meeting and speak against the proposal.\n\"Our community voices matter. Together we can defeat this transparent challenge to the Eastern Shore value of treating others with dignity and respect at all times,\" wrote Michele Dappert, forum president, in a newsletter Saturday. \"The community must speak out to ensure this progress is not erased.\"\nThe proposed resolution is expected to be on the agenda for the Talbot County Council's next meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
