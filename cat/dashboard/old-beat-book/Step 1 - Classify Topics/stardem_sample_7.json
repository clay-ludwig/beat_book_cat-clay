Everyone should have pride in our town and community.\nSince when does sexual orientation take up more time at our town meetings than critical issues like education, health care or our local finances? That is called priority.\nWhy are people from outside of Easton using our town meetings to address their personal agenda and issues? Have these people tried their efforts in Denton, Ridgely or Cambridge? Do the residents of Easton want to be a hub or centerpiece for the \"pride group\" on the entire Delmarva Peninsula?\nEaston's positive reputation has been established over many many years without flag waving and shouting from outside groups. Money has been invested by private citizens to successfully beautify our downtown. Thank You. That is good for Easton and for tourism.\nPositive efforts, as shown, will help to improve life for Easton residents while small \"groupthink\" from outside does not. Our town leadership needs to lead not follow. Easton town officials were elected to represent all Easton residents first not their own personal or political agenda. Certainly not the agenda of outside influences that waste town time and energy.\nLet's get down to business at our meetings and let the outside Delmarva group and others find somewhere else to disrupt.\nRICH ADRIAN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The declarers who are good at that are used to saying to partner, \"Don't tell me - the suit is splitting badly yet again.\" How should South have planned the play in three notrump on today's deal? West, after overcalling in spades, led the diamond king: two, 10The bidding was pushy.North's two-spade cue bid showed at least gameinvitational values with club support. South was not happy rebidding two no-trump, but he knew his partner did not have four hearts (no negative double over one spade), and five clubs was a long way away. North raised because he had a fifth club and a vulnerable game bonus was very tempting.South saw six top tricks: three hearts, one diamond and two clubs. If clubs were 2-1, there were nine easy winners. So, declarer assumed they were 3-0. Who had the tripleton? Surely it was East because West already seemed to be marked with at least nine pointedsuit cards. However, before immediately playing a club to dummy's king, he silently said to himself, \"Wait, wait.\" He could acquire more data by first cashing his heart winners.Well, well - West had only one heart. If he had been void in clubs, he would have had something like 6=1=6=0 distribution and surely would have bid three or four diamonds over two no-trump.South cashed his club ace and claimed when East discarded.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Baltimore will pay two installments of $1,662,150 on Sept. 15 and 30, according to trade details obtained by The Associated Press. The money reduces San Diego's expense to $482,151, which comes to a prorated share of the $760,000 minimum for each.\nBaltimore will send Detroit $2,758,065 on Sept. 30 as part of the trade that sent right-hander Charlie Morton to the Tigers for minor league left-hander Micah Ashman. Morton was owed $4,758,064 of his $15 million salary, and the cash reduces his cost to the Tigers to $2 million. In addition, the Orioles will send the Tigers $100,000 on Aug. 15 as part of the trade to acquire left-hander Dietrich Enns.\nThe Orioles also are sending Toronto $1.75 million on Sept. 30 as part of the July 29 trade that sent right-hander Seranthony Domínguez to the Blue Jays for minor league right-hander Juaron Watts-Brown — a deal announced between games of a doubleheader between the teams. Domínguez had $2,645,161 left from his $8 million salary at the time of the trade.\nBaltimore is giving Houston $520,000 along with infielder Ramón Urías, who was dealt for minor leaguer right-hander Twine Palmer. The money is due in equal payments on Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. Urías was owed $1,016,129 of his $3.15 million salary.\nMoney in the five trades totals $8,452,365. Baltimore opened the season with a $169 million payroll, 15th among the 30 major league teams.\nMinnesota is paying $33 million to Houston in the July 31 trade that returned All-Star Carlos Correa to the Astros for minor league left-hander Matt Mikulski, by far the largest amount among 14 deadline trades involving cash transactions. That covered a significant portion of the $103,419,355 remaining in the contract of the three-time All-Star, who left the Astros to sign with the Twins ahead of the 2022 season. Houston gets $3 million this year and $10 million each in 2026, 2027 and 2028, with installments due each Dec. 15.\nArizona will pay Milwaukee $5,258,000 as part of the July 31 trade that sent right-hander Shelby Miller and left-hander Jordan Montgomery to the Brewers for a player to be named or cash. Arizona will send the money in four installments of $1,314,500 on Aug. 15, Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30. Montgomery was owed $7,137,097 of his $22.5 million salary and Miller $317,204 of his $1 million salary.\nMilwaukee is sending San Diego $2,169,000 as part of the trade that sent left-hander Nestor Cortes and minor league infielder Jorge Quintana to the Padres for outfielder Brandon Lockridge. That offsets part of the $2,410,753 remaining from Cortes' $7.6 million salary. The Brewers will send $361,500 each on Aug. 15 and 29, Sept. 12 and 26 plus $723,000 on Oct. 10.\nCincinnati is paying Pittsburgh $1,935,484 as part of the July 30 trade that sent left-hander Taylor Rogers and minor league shortstop Sammy Stafura to the Pirates for third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes. The cash covers half the $3,870,968 Rogers was owed from his $12 million salary, and the Reds paid $435,484 on Aug. 1 and owe $500,000 each on Aug. 15, Sept. 1 and Sept. 15.\nRogers was dealt the following day to the Cubs for outfielder Ivan Brethowr, and Pittsburgh agreed to give the Cubs $1,903,226. That offset half the $3,806,452 then left on Rogers' salary after the $64,516 he earned during his one day with Pittsburgh, for whom he never threw a pitch. The Pirates pay $423,226 on Aug . 15 and owe $500,000 installments on Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30.\nSan Francisco will give Kansas City $1,934,100 as part of the trade that sent outfielder Mike Yastzemski to the Royals for right-hander Yunior Marte. Yastzemski was owed $2,934,140 of his $9.25 million salary, and the Giants will make four payments of $483,535 on Aug. 15. Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30.\nTampa Bay is sending Milwaukee $1.1 million in the July 28 trade that sent catcher Danny Jansen to his hometown Brewers for minor league infielder Jadher Areinamo. Jansen was owed $2,833,333 of his $8.5 million salary. The Rays will make six payments of $183,333, on Aug. 1, 15 and 29, Sept. 12 and 26, and Oct. 10. Tampa Bay agreed to send an additional $500,000 if a $12 million mutual option for 2026 is declined, which carries a $500,000 buyout.\nSt. Louis agreed to pay Atlanta $2.28 million as part of the July 27 trade that sent right-hander Erick Fedde to the Braves for a player to be named or cash. Fedde was owed $2,455,645 from his $7.25 million salary. The Cardinals will make equal payments of $1.14 million on Aug. 11 and Sept. 22.\nDetroit will pay Texas $100,000 on Aug. 15 as part of the trade to acquire right-hander Codi Heuer. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She and her husband stay active in the community by supporting the local St. Leonard Volunteer Fire Department, of which her husband Richard is the company's training officer.\nWhen she's not writing, she's reading, designing her book covers, and occasionally editing fundraising letters or offering advice and encouragement to other independent authors. She is currently working on the third book in the series, which as of now is untitled.\nThe books are available at www.amazon.com/author/judyhannigan.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nAlways a voracious reader, I drafted the first chapter of \"Lost in Prosperity\" while in high school, but I didn't finish the story until recently. I penned the second novel, \"Everything in Prosperity,\" last year.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nI write historical westerns because in that era you could reinvent yourself. My characters do what's right instead of what's told, exemplifying justice can triumph. I believe honor, courage, and loyalty are the principles by which to live.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nWriting is my third career. I started as a high school and college teacher before becoming a technical editor. Now I write full-time, and every day is an adventure.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nI center my stories around a major event before I begin layering in backstories and challenges. I see scenes as if watching through a camera lens, so when the unexpected happens or characters pop up I investigate the possibilities, which means I rarely stick to an outline.\nWho are some of your favorite authors?\n\"Lonesome Dove\" author, Larry McMurtry wrote one of the most beloved westerns. I want readers of his novels and fans of television shows like \"Yellowstone,\" \"The Virginian,\" and \"The Rifleman\" to experience an era in which perseverance, loyalty, forgiveness, and the enduring power of love could redeem a wounded soul. Rosanne Bittner's \"Savage Destiny\" and \"Outlaw Hearts\" series feature flawed but courageous characters that fulfill their potential when forced into the gray zone wedged between black and white.\nPlease include a brief description of the book\nSet in the 1870s, \"Lost in Prosperity\" opens the series by blending adventure, romance, and suspenseful mystery to tell the story of Sam Hilliard Stone, a rich and beautiful heiress with a temper as fast as her quick draw, and Providence \"Jackson\" Knight, the handsome, rugged rancher determined to protect the woman he loves, as they struggle to build a dynasty in the wild, Wyoming Territory. Together, they navigate threats from an unknown enemy to uncover why events from their past are converging to destroy their future.\nIn \"Everything in Prosperity,\" Sam and Jackson risk everything to protect the town citizens from a notorious gang and survive the tangled web of deceptions threatening them.\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\n\"Jackson's face was pale. He tried to brush her hands away. Failing, he grabbed her wrists and pulled her close. \"Sonofabitch, Sam — even shot up, all I think about is how much I love you and ache for you to love me.\"\nSam's eyes filled with tears as she gently wriggled her wrists from his grasp. It wasn't difficult.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Those worries stem from an April directive from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlining the Trump administration's view that DEI programs violate federal law.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher and council member Dave Stepp sponsored Tuesday's resolution, which passed 4-1 with council member Keasha Haythe opposing. Haythe, Lesher and council member Lynn Mielke had voted down Stepp's attempt to remove the DEI statement in March.\nLesher, a Democrat, said it was a difficult decision, noting he changed his tune on the measure due to a \"vindictive and maleficent federal administration.\"\n\"The risk is that some incompetent political appointee will read only the title of our statement, misconstrue it as an illegal policy and deny a federal grant on that basis,\" Lesher said. \"In an event like that, even if we win on appeal, it could leave us in a state of construction limbo for an unacceptably long time.\"\nLesher added, \"We simply need to ensure that we are using none of the language that could trigger some snowflake in Washington.\"\nMielke, a Republican, said she agreed with Lesher and that Talbot County has always been a merit-based employer.\nStepp, a Republican, said council members \"fell short\" and put the county in a vulnerable spot when they rejected his original proposal in March.\n\"It's very frustrating that we even need to be discussing this here today. It should've been dealt with months ago,\" Stepp said. \"This matter has been highly politicized and turned into something it is not.\"\n\"Today's action is fiscal in nature,\" he added.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan, a Republican, voted to remove the statement in March and did so again Tuesday. He said the controversial topic — which garnered strong resident opposition and led to two heated meetings — has been \"tough on council.\"\n\"I know we all have our own beliefs, one way or the other with the DEI stuff,\" Callahan said. \"But at this time I think we've made the right decision and the right statement.\"\nHaythe, the council's only non-white member and a Democrat, asked county attorney Patrick Thomas about an opinion letter he provided on the DEI statement and Duffy's directive. Duffy's directive to all DOT funding recipients referenced the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 rejection of affirmative action programs at Harvard University.\n\"I do not believe that the statement is discriminatory, and I do not believe that the Supreme Court (case) being referenced in the secretary of transportation letter applies to that statement,\" Thomas said.\nTuesday's resolution, effectively immediately, voids Talbot County's DEI statement. Two 2020 diversity resolutions are also \"of no further force and effect,\" according to the newly approved resolution.\nThose resolutions had facilitated the creation of the diversity statement and required the county manager to provide an annual diversity training report to the council, respectively.\nThe new resolution states nothing in it \"shall be construed as a repudiation of the intent and desire\" of the county to ensure a \"welcoming workplace\" in which employees are treated fairly based on race, sex, national origin, etc.\nLesher asked county staff to work on a \"replacement welcoming statement\" for the county's employee handbook.\nAIRPORT PROJECT\nEaston Airport's ongoing modernization project — which will relocate and expand the airport's main runway — is 90% funded by the Federal Aviation Administration, an organization within the Department of Transportation. The airport is owned and operated by Talbot County.\nAirport Manager Micah Risher said he consulted with county staff after the April DOT letter. In an interview Tuesday, Risher said he has \"absolute faith\" in the council's support of the airport. Risher added that the airport ensures it is always abiding by federal and state laws.\n\"To have Easton Airport have any sort of funding at jeopardy, it's a bigger deal than the average person may think,\" Risher said, citing the airport's large economic impact on the community.\nAccording to Risher, the airport received around $17 million from the FAA for the first two phases of the project. Estimates on the remaining federal funding for the rest of the project aren't available since bids are out, he said, but over $30 million of work remains.\n\"We're up here against our greatest milestone that is really going to ensure that we have a viable airport, and this great economic engine, succeed here in Talbot County for another 80-plus years,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton election cycle has been charged, political in nature\n\n May 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Easton saw a heated election the last time the council president seat was up for grabs. This year's race is no different.Since campaigns for the three open Town Council seats began this winter, there have been stolen and vandalized campaign signs, tense debates on campaign finance transparency and, most recently, political mailers from Republican-endorsed candidates calling out Mayor Megan Cook.\nThe tenor of the election cycle — which culminates with voting Tuesday — is largely influenced by the race for Town Council president between incumbent Frank Gunsallus and current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello.\nAt a town hall Tuesday, both candidates offered thoughts on civility.\n\"In the past two years, the council members overall, have been almost always conducting themselves in a civil manner,\" said Gunsallus. \"There are times where debate may get heated. That is the nature of democracy.\"\n\"Arguing is fine, I get it. Disagreements occur,\" Abbatiello said. \"But it needs to be done in a respectful manner.\"\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry, who has endorsed Abbatiello, said the charged nature of this election isn't normal for Easton. And it's hurting the town, she says.\n\"Anytime you create an environment based on animosity, it becomes counterproductive, fairly quickly,\" Curry said. \"And I think that's sort of where we are today.\"\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee vice chair Shari Wilcoxon believes a reason the race is so intense is that it's a fight to preserve Easton's charm.\n\"People love our little town. It's a jewel,\" she said. \"And we had a lot of people move here during COVID because they wanted to get out of the crud to come to this little town. A lot of us want to preserve that.\"\nENDORSEMENTS\nAs Gunsallus and Abbatiello square off, they have racked up endorsements from local politicians and even fellow council members.\nAbbatiello received endorsements from Curry and, in a surprise to some, Ward 3's David Montgomery, who had sided with Gunsallus on several contentious matters discussed by the council in the past year.\n\"It would be very hard for us to move forward productively for the next four years under that kind of leadership,\" Montgomery said of Gunsallus.\nCurry says Abbatiello's experience and knowledge make him the best candidate. \"He has the right temperament,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Gunsallus' main endorsements come from Republican leaders — the Republican Central Committee, Sheriff Joe Gamble, Sen. Johnny Mautz and Dels. Chris Adams and Tom Hutchinson.\nWilcoxon said the committee looked at values — not necessarily party affiliation — when endorsing Gunsallus and mother-and-son newcomers Lynn and Cameron Keefe, who are running in Wards 2 and 4, respectively.\n\"To me he's a phenomenal leader,\" Wilcoxon said of Gunsallus, citing his thoughtfulness and transparency.\n\"He's not afraid to ask questions,\" Mautz said. \" ... Sometimes, the questions may seem silly. And other times, they may reveal things that most people aren't aware of.\"\nAbbatiello and his supporters have denounced the involvement of political parties in the town's election, which is nonpartisan and doesn't list candidates alongside a party.\n\"I do not think that the Republican Party platform has anything to do with the issues that we face here in Easton, and so I don't understand why the party has decided to intervene so strongly in a local election,\" Montgomery, a Republican, said.\nMautz said while the election is performed as nonpartisan, it is political in nature. \"Every election has got politics baked into it,\" he said.\n\"I think that everybody fools themselves if they say it's nonpartisan,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Everybody knows. Everybody knows everybody's party. We can just cut the pretending, right?\"\nFlavio Hickel, an associate professor of political science at Washington College, sees both sides of the argument.\n\"Broadly speaking, I don't think it's a good idea to allow for local party endorsements or to make nonpartisan elections partisan, because you are allowing partisanship to interfere in local town government,\" Hickel said.\nHowever, Hickel said knowing which parties candidates align with is informative for voters, especially at a local level.\n\"Most voters probably aren't familiar with the candidates running,\" he said. \" ... What party identity does at all levels of elections is it provides a very quick information shortcut for voters.\"\nCurry and Montgomery's endorsements have raised questions, too.\nWilcoxon said she views Montgomery's opposition to Gunsallus as personal and said she believes Montgomery and Cook's sponsorship of a campaign finance ordinance was \"100%\" an attack on Gunsallus' campaign.\nAt the town hall Tuesday, Gunsallus spoke of council endorsements: \"I would not want an endorsement from a fellow council member because I believe that that is out of bounds,\" he said. Then he made a remark seemingly concerning Montgomery.\n\"And especially one of them, I would not accept it.\"\nMontgomery disputed that claim, telling The Star Democrat Friday that Gunsallus asked for his endorsement a few months ago, but that he declined.\nCurry said she hadn't before made an endorsement as a sitting council member, but that she gave a \"great deal of thought\" in endorsing Abbatiello.\nIn her eyes, the discourse around endorsements and political sides are making the campaign heated, instead of what she'd rather the election be centered on: issues such as growth and housing.\n\"There's too much of the 'he said,' 'he said,' and he's backed by this guy and he's backed by this guy,\" Curry said. \"The issues have taken a back seat, and that's wrong.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "This Juneteenth, let's prioritize education policy\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TROY ROLLING | Section: Columns \n \n 703\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 19, the United States will commemorate Juneteenth, or National Independence Day — the federal holiday celebrated annually to commemorate the ending of slavery. Scholars have described Juneteenth as a celebration of the legacy of Frederick Douglass, the famed Maryland abolitionist, orator and writer who influenced tens of thousands of people about the evils of slavery and urged the nation to abide by its espoused principles.Time and time again, Douglass demonstrated education's importance in breaking the cycles of poverty and oppression.\nBorn into slavery on the Eastern Shore, he secretly learned to read and write, realizing that knowledge was vital to freedom. His journey from bondage to intellectual empowerment confirmed his lifelong assertion that education is the essential ingredient to liberation and equality.\nThrough his speeches, writings and political actions, Douglass emphasized that ignorance was a tool of oppression, and that education was crucial for social and economic advancement. His mentorship and influence inspired future generations to use education to combat racial injustice and achieve greater equality, demonstrating how education is vital in the fight for civil rights and equality for all.\nOur organization has worked tirelessly to ensure these principles permeate every aspect of our society. Unfortunately, however, two centuries later, some of Maryland's elected representatives appear to be forgetting the lessons that Douglass taught us on the importance of taking accountability for education to give our citizens the opportunity to succeed.\nUpon review of these statistics, we should all be alarmed and demand that those currently and seeking to represent us provide their educational plans. Prince George's County served as a salient example. Although one of the wealthiest majority African American counties in the United States, with a median household income of nearly $100,000, the county is dead last in statewide education rankings. The graduation rate is less than 75%, the second-worst ranking in the state, behind only Baltimore City, where 23 schools have existing challenges.\nInstead of improving, too many of the children are being left behind. Last year, the county's high schools underperformed every single state education target and four of the schools lost a star in the state's ranking system. Given these starting statistics, it is little wonder why, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, income inequality and other social injustices continue to increase in the county year-over-year.\nIt will take committed elected leadership to make the changes required to make a difference. Yet, when asked about the school system's challenges, County Executive Angela Alsobrooks responded, \"Not my responsibility.\"\nThis answer is especially worrisome because Ms. Alsobrooks is now a nominee for the U.S. Senate. As a senator, she would have the power to break the cycles of educational bankruptcy by pushing for these policies on the federal level, but her comments should make all of us pause. Worse yet, Ms. Alsobrooks recently announced that she opposes charter schools and school choice, which rescue marginalized students from failing schools.\nPatrick Wolf, a professor in educational policy, found that \"the 19 most rigorous scientific studies of private school-choice programs find that they tend to have positive effects on student achievement, especially several years after students have entered a private school of their parents' choosing,\" increasing their chances of graduating from high school, attending college and receiving a college degree.\nAfrican Americans and underserved communities are the primary beneficiaries of these policies. Recent polling shows that 79% of Black parents support school choice and 74% support charter schools.\nAs Frederick Douglass once profoundly stated, \"It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.\" Indeed. Education creates a cycle of success for future generations, leading to a more informed, resilient, and prosperous society. By breaking the chains of ignorance and poverty, it builds the foundation for strong, thriving communities that can overcome challenges and achieve collective progress.\nOn this Juneteenth, let us pay tribute to his legacy by recognizing and acting upon Douglass' vital lesson. By re-prioritizing education policy in the Maryland political landscape, we will honor Douglass' memory and sacrifice while paving the way for a more just and equitable future, filled with hope and opportunity.\nTroy Rolling is chairman of the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based national education nonprofit that does Christian work based on the life and legacy of Frederick Douglass. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Legislators, local officials differ on unhoused individuals bill\n\n February 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A bill filed in Annapolis to enshrine rights for homeless individuals is drawing differing opinions from advocates and local officials.House Bill 487, and its paired Senate Bill 484, would protect the ability of homeless individuals to partake in \"life-sustaining activities\" such as sleeping, eating or drinking, in public places so long as traffic is not obstructed.\nIf passed, any civil or criminal punishment against an unhoused individual who is on public land without an \"adequate alternative indoor\" space would be considered cruel and unusual punishment.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's most recent data, Maryland's homeless population in 2023 was 5,865 individuals, both sheltered and unsheltered.\nDel. Bernice Mireku North (D-Montgomery), the bill's sponsor, and other advocates say the proposed legislation comes in response to a Supreme Court decision last June that ruled it was not cruel and unusual punishment for local governments to civilly and criminally penalize homeless people for setting up encampments on public land.\nMireku-North wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat that the proposed bill has \"brought to light the heart-led efforts\" of local governments to support unhoused individuals. An emphasis of the bill is to prevent immediate arrests, she said.\n\"At a minimum, we are asking law enforcement to prioritize inquiring whether an alternative indoor space exists for unhoused people engaging in life-sustaining activities before resorting to arrest,\" Mireku-North wrote.\nThe delegate said legislators are \"committed\" to working with local officials and stakeholders on the bill.\nAllie Post, director of development and communications for The Women's Law Center of Maryland, said the bill would be a measure in which the state \"(stands) up for folks proactively\" following the June Supreme Court ruling.\n\"Especially for survivors (of domestic violence) and survivors of color, homelessness is often a price of leaving an abuser,\" Post said. \"And folks who have less financial means and less flexibility in those means are really put between a rock and a hard place, and this is an opportunity for Maryland to step up and start taking seriously the homelessness problem that we have.\"\nWhile advocates say it's a needed step forward in the path to address Maryland's homelessness crisis, some Easton and Talbot County officials say the bill is endangering the efforts already being taken.\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and the Sheriff's Office released a video on Facebook last month depicting what they believe a potential encounter could look like with a homeless individual if the bill is passed.\n\"If these were to pass, we could have homeless encampments in Idlewild Park, (the) courthouse,\" Gamble said in a separate video the department shared. \" … You literally could set up a tent on the 50-yard-line at Easton High School before an Easton football game and call it your home, and we would not be able to move those people.\"\nGamble said the homelessness issue is serious in Talbot County and that he's not against addressing it. However, he believes the bill as written will strip away authority of locally elected officials.\n\"They will not be able to follow the zoning laws that they've put into place to make downtown Easton the place it is, or downtown St. Michaels or downtown Oxford to be those nice places that people want to come to visit and spend their hard-earned money,\" Gamble said in an interview. \"They will have absolutely no control over it.\"\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook addressed the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee in a Feb. 5 letter opposing the bill.\nCook wrote that the bill \"would supersede local ordinance and policies that have been carefully crafted to address the needs of both unhoused individuals and the broader community.\"\n\"By prohibiting local and state officials from enforcing reasonable regulations on the use of public spaces, the bill could lead to unintended consequences that compromise public safety, hinder economic development, and create significant enforcement challenges,\" Cook wrote.\nIn her letter, Cook asked legislators to instead focus on policies that would provide funding for housing assistance, mental health and job programs.\n\"Our community is committed to addressing homelessness with dignity and care—through outreach, support services, and housing initiatives—while also ensuring that public spaces remain accessible and safe for all,\" Cook wrote. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local chef nominated for James Beard Award\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Although Bas Rouge is getting national attention, it is a local restaurant at its core.On its menu, passion for the Chesapeake takes center stage, says Executive Chef Harley Peet. His efforts to celebrate the Eastern Shore's people and ecology have helped land him on the shortlist for one of the culinary industry's most prestigious awards.\nThe James Beard Foundation has named Peet as a semifinalist for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. Just getting considered is a \"huge deal\" for the team at Bas Rouge, the executive chef said.\n\"I have never pursued it because I was so intimidated by it. But then I built this amazing team, and Mr. (Paul) Prager, the owner, helped me build this amazing team and put this amazing restaurant together,\" Peet said. \"... Then we started getting the influx. Going for the James Beard built a lot of confidence in myself and in my team.\"\nEstablished in 1990 and first awarded in 1991, the James Beard Foundation's Restaurant and Chef Awards recognize exceptional talent and achievement in the culinary arts, hospitality, media and broader food system, as well as a demonstrated commitment to racial and gender equity, community, sustainability and a culture where all can thrive, according to the James Beard website.\nNominees for the award will be announced on Wednesday, April 3, and winners will be announced at the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards Ceremony on Monday, June 10.\nThe Bas Rouge team draws inspiration from the endless bounty of the Chesapeake to inform its menu, which offers European-style dishes made with local ingredients.\n\"Every year, every turn of the season it absolutely floors me with something that tastes even better,\" Peet said. \"The natural shift of final products that are coming out of the Bay or coming out of the fields in the summer, they continuously always get better. The purveyors, and the growers and the foragers that we deal with are constantly trying to find something better, something more mind blowing.\"\n\"This is a miraculous thing about this area. It never disappoints,\" he said.\nThese local ingredients are transformed into elegant dishes in Bas Rouge's kitchen, including the restaurant's lunchtime favorite wiener schnitzel, an array of oysters and, when the chefs have it in, a Dover sole that Peet says draws diners from as far as D.C.\n\"It is food that we love and have a passion to cook and eat,\" Peet said. \"I think the idea of taking a raw ingredient from the Chesapeake Bay or from a field delivered to the back door by a forager. What do you do in these small towns? You fish, you hunt, you gather because it is fun. It is part of the lifestyle here. So as far as what the food is about and has to say, the food is about myself and my team taking as much local (as we can), accented with fine imported ingredients because of course you have to have some diversity.\"\n\"We have a hyper focus on what we have right here,\" he said.\nBut beyond the Chesapeake's flora and fauna, Peet said that he has decades of lived experiences on the Eastern Shore from which he draws inspiration.\nHe recalled one time 20 years ago when he was just out of culinary school and his first assignment was on Tilghman Island. He was using oysters in a dish, but he wanted to know where the ingredients came from.\nThere was a bus boy who also worked as a waterman. Peet got an invitation to go oystering.\n\"So I am up there in my sailing gear. And these watermen are laughing at me. They are in white rubber boots and Grundens, and I am out there in Haley Hansen and Patagonia. They said, 'You know we are about to get dirty?' And I said, 'Alright, let's do it.'\"\nHe learned by doing. He learned how oyster tonging works, how dredging works and how patent tonging works. He even learned how certain boats are rigged.\n\"If you don't understand that, then preparing (the ingredient) and serving it lacks a little passion. We have a round-about 360-degree connection with that. Terroir is a number one,\" said Peet. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Preliminary rounds air live on the Golf Channel, while CBS offers live coverage of the final rounds Saturday, Aug. 26, and Sunday, Aug. 27.Born June 21, 1996, in Ridgewood, New Jersey, Scheffler spent most of his young life in Dallas. Before turning pro, Scheffler won the individual state title three years in a row and further sharpened his skills at the University of Texas, where he earned multiple all-American honors and helped his team win a national championship.Bursting onto the professional golf scene in 2018, the American hasn't missed a beat, climbing the ranks and proving to the golf world that he's here to stay. One of Scheffler's standout moments came during the 2020 PGA Championship when he made history by shooting the lowest score ever recorded in a major by a rookie.This season, Scheffler is at it again, sitting at the top of the standings in both the world rankings and money leaderboard, earning over $18 million.He has had seven consecutive top-five finishes - the longest streak since Tiger Woods - and his 2.81 strokes gained tee-to-green this season is one of the best single-season paces for any player in the PGA since tracking began two years ago. Adding to an already impressive season, Scheffler is making a bogey or worse just 10.1% of the time, keeping him on pace for the lowest rate since - once again - Tiger Woods in 2000 (9.8). \n \n Memo: Full name: Scott Alexander Scheffler Birthdate: June 21, 1996 (27) Birthplace: Ridgewood, New Jersey Height/weight: 6-3/200 pounds PGA Tour wins: 6 Family ties: Has three sisters, Callie, Molly and Sarah - sister Callie played golf at Texas A & M and caddied for her brother when he competed as an amateur in the 2017 U.S.\n \nOpen Honors and achievements: PGA Tour Rookie of the Year (2019), PGA Tour leading money winner (2021-22), PGA Tour Player of the Year (2021-22), Best Golfer ESPY Award (2023), winner of the 2023 Solution is on page 19.

    "content": "A fresh look: Northern Ireland's troubled history is traced in PBS documentary\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Typically and logically, some of the most telling documents of history are those related by people who actually lived through the given times.The timeline of the strains of life in Northern Ireland is well-known, and it gets first-person treatment in a PBS documentary that spans five parts and three nights. After first being presented as a streaming offering via the network's digital avenues last May, \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" makes its broadcast premiere nightly from Monday, Aug. 28, through Wednesday, Aug. 30 (check local listings).Co-produced with PBS with England's BBC and BBC Northern Ireland, the program by filmmaker James Bluemel showcases the memories of individuals who experienced daily challenges over the course of more than three decades, from the late 1960s - and the start of what were known as The Troubles, which ultimately cost an estimated 3500-plus lives - to the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998.The Troubles technically began in 1966 with the Ulster Volunteer Army's opposition to the Irish Republican Army punctuated by several attacks on Catholics.As detailed in the program's opening hour, \"It Wasn't Like a Movie Anymore,\" the situation festered over several years and ultimately erupted into Bloody Sunday, the 1972 event that saw British soldiers shoot 26 unarmed civilians during a protest in Derry, Northern Ireland. Thirteen of the wounded died on the exact day, and one more succumbed to his injuries after several months.Part 2, \"Do Paramilitaries Lie Awake at Night?,\" picks up in the immediate aftermath of the massacre as other instances of violence occurred. While Catholics and Protestants were very divided in the face of bombings and rigid paramilitary patrols, young people on each side of the conflict found punk music to be a respite, particularly in giving voice to their emotions.The third part, \"So Many Broken Hearts,\" recalls how alarmingly common the discord in Northern Ireland became - encompassing assassinations and car bombings. Also, a hunger strike was waged by IRA prisoners to protest the policies of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.In Part 4, \"The Dirty War,\" the documentary moves along to the late 1980s. The ongoing violence was supplemented by an increase in the information war while the physical one raged on, with efforts to infiltrate paramilitary groups used as attempts to stop the conflict from within. Considerable paranoia resulted, as very few people were sure who to trust.The concluding portion, \"Who Wants to Live Like That?,\" involves a major diplomatic controversy: namely, U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1994 White House invitation to Gerry Adams, the then-leader of the Sinn Fein party, which was associated at the time with the Irish Republican Army. That move drew sharply differing reactions, but the same year, the IRA announced a ceasefire (which would last until 1996). Later in 1994, loyalist paramilitaries also issued a ceasefire, contingent on \"the continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence.\" History bears out that the legacy of The Troubles continued for years, but \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" covers much of the essential information comprehensively. And a great deal of it remains troubling today. \n \n Caption: James as featured in \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis in Ward 4.ROBERT RANKIN\nRobert Rankin is a newcomer to Easton politics, yet he displayed a firm grasp of the issues facing the town.\nWe liked his stands on issues, and most importantly, we liked that he admitted when he needed more information before voicing a conclusive opinion on issues we asked about.\nRankin's professionalism was evident. He called for a multi-faceted approach to increasing affordable housing in Easton, stressing the need to get more housing that is affordable for young families. His suggestions included working with developers to provide incentives, looking for more projects with townhomes and apartments, and redeveloping existing properties. It was a thoughtful answer.\nRankin also talked about his concerns on how new residential developments impact traffic, parking, schools and public safety. He wants an emphasis on a more strategic approach to approving future projects.\nHe wants to see more pedestrian-friendly and traffic calming features throughout the town. One suggestion included more crosswalks and sidewalks to better support pedestrian safety.\nHe was the only candidate to talk about increasing recreational opportunities on the east side of Route 50 where the majority of Ward 2 is located.\nHe suggested looking at retirement packages to assist in recruiting and retaining police officers in Easton.\nOne last note: Rankin has managed trade associations during his career. He knows what it is like to build consensus among many competing interests. Those will be valuable skills on the council.\nTHE REV. ELMER DAVIS\nThe Rev. Elmer Davis has long been a voice for people in the 4th Ward. He is also a voice of reason in the city during council meetings. Davis is not afraid to speak his mind, but his background as a preacher and pastor helps him look for common ground.\nDavis noted his position on the Town Council dais. As the Ward 4 council member, he is the last one called to voice an opinion on discussion topics. This gives him a chance to hear all of the other council members. Often his message is one of finding consensus in disparate views.\n\"I aim to continue bridging the gap between the council and the people I represent, ensuring every voice is heard and valued,\" he said.\nDavis was prophetic when he asked the question in our interview: \"What do we want Easton to be?\"\nHis multi-part answer is a walkable community with sufficient traffic infrastructure to keep the town moving. He suggested a bus service from hotels to downtown to get visitors to the shops that make Easton special. He was solution oriented.\nDavis called for ensuring that first responders have the equipment and resources to respond to any incident.\nHe offered the best option we have heard for building affordable housing in the community — having the town purchase land and then partnering with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity to build the homes, involving the future homeowner in the process.\nHe said the town needs affordable housing \"that people working at WaWa and McDonald's can afford.\"\nHe wants the council involved in approving housing projects in Easton. The Planning Commission, he said, should be making recommendations, not granting approvals.\nOne of his two opponents, Moonyene Jackson-Amis, would be our pick if Davis had not been doing such a fine job during his five years on the council. She is a former council member, an attorney and a community leader with multiple college degrees. She spoke passionately in our conversations about underrepresented communities in Easton. She continues to be a foundational rock in our town.\nBut Davis is our pick to continue his work on the council. He has done well these past five years, and he has become the face of Ward 4 with deep connections throughout the community.\nDavis has experience, civility and strong ties to the community. He talks about his close-knit connection to his roots in the community shaping his values.\n\"I believe there is still much work to be done to enhance the quality of life for our residents,\" Davis said. We agree, and the reverend is the person to do that. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They were the better team tonight. I thought they brought a whole lot of energy. We didn't match their energy tonight. First quarter, came out, played well. And then after that.\"\nEaston (14-6, 13-3) led 12-5 with a little over 3 minutes remaining in the first quarter. Cambridge-SD sophomore Sterling Perkins (17 points) converted a steal into a layup. Darren Belizare turned another steal into a layup. Pinder then buried a 3-pointer to forge a 12-12 tie heading into the second quarter.\nCambridge-SD continued to hound the Warriors defensively and took control of the game, outscoring Easton, 21-11 in the second quarter.\n\"We got a chip on our shoulder,\" said Cambridge-SD head coach Shawn Tucker, who was minus starting point guard LaShaun Moody. \"We're the underdogs we feel like every game we're going in. There's so much negativity that goes with these C-SD boys. And they just fight and fight. They're resilient. And they represent me. I'm wild. I'm passionate. I'm full of energy.\"\nSo were the Vikings.\nEaston shaved a seven-point deficit to 25-21 when sophomore guard Marshall Bailey (18 points) hit a pair of free throws with 2:36 left in the second quarter. But Perkins and junior Koby Ennals (12 points) drained back-to-back 3-pointers before a Kamarion Hall's bucket capped an 8-0 run, that helped the Vikings to a 33-23 halftime lead.\n\"I give all props to my assistant coaches, also my defensive coach, Ryan Waters,\" Tucker said. \"He has those guys locked in on defense. And we've been pressuring teams for the last seven games. We're just relentless on that.\"\nAfter letting a 17-point third-quarter lead get away in a 58-57 loss to Queen Anne's on Feb. 1, Cambridge-SD has reeled off seven straight wins.\nEaston scored the last five points of the third quarter to pull within 50-41 at the end of the third quarter. But the Warriors wouldn't get any closer, as the Vikings outscored their longtime rival, 29-19, in the fourth quarter.\n\"They were shooting the heck out of the ball tonight,\" Hynson said of the Vikings. \"Their zero (Perkins) and their number 12 (Pinder), they were shooting the ball real well.\n\"Our defense was horrible,\" Hynson added. \"We were just sitting there watching their shooters. And we were giving up too many straight line drives to the basket. We'll learn from it. Like I told them, it's over and done with. Just got to move on and get ready for playoffs.\"\nJa'Kai Brooks led Easton with 19 points.\nJaden Harris had 12 points for Cambridge-SD and Anthony Hughes added 10.\n\"We got four goals and we just accomplished one of them,\" said Tucker of winning the North Bayside.\nQUEEN ANNE'S 76 KENT ISLAND 73\nCENTREVILLE — Vince Gilberto scored 19 points and Collin Woolford went over the 1,000-point mark for his career as the Lions outlasted their county rival in overtime.\nAmari Baynard had 15 points for Queen Anne's (16-4, 14-2) and Jadereon Thompson had 13.\nSSPP 56, JEMICY 41\nOWINGS MILLS — Brayden Smith had 18 points and Aaron Ewing netted 10 as Saints Peter and Paul improved to 14-8 overall, 7-3 in the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association C Conference.\nCOL.

She was one of many vendors who had previously attended the event not to distribute resources, but to receive them.\n\"It's really refreshing to be able to give back,\" Jefferson said. \"Just a couple years ago, I was somebody that was coming through the doors and receiving services myself, so it's good to see that we can help families in need.\"\nThe Caroline Cares Community Resource Day featured around 40 vendors providing information, help and food to the community.\n\"This is what it's all about,\" said Stephanie Johnson, His Hope Ministries' executive director and board member for Resources Day. \"Just getting all the resources in one building so that it can be kind of an easily accessible for those who need them the most. Being able to bring those providers under one roof, on a specific day, to get those services out to everybody who needs them is huge.\"\nOne of the main focuses for Resource Day is providing many different types of help for many different people.\nSome attendees face expenses they can't afford or are just in a bad financial situation, and some people are homeless. Resources Day helped with a variety of situations.\nDirectors expect 100 to 150 county residents experiencing homelessness to attend Resources Day every year, and they have a plan to make sure homeless residents can find shelter.\n\"With this particular event, they have access to walk around, talk to the vendors and see what exactly what their services are that they provide,\" Johnson said. \"However, like when it comes to those who are actually experiencing homelessness, we have a separate room set aside for them to really dig into what their needs are and see how we can connect them with services.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools officials attended, providing information for children on enrollment in school and many different resources for mental and physical health. United4Caroline provided free diapers for families with infants.\nChesapeake College's nursing program provided free blood pressure checks for all people in attendance. Nursing students gained experience and enjoyed serving the community.\n\"Oh, I love this, and I'm actually from Denton myself, so to give back to the community is amazing,\" Katie Reuwer, an assistant professor at Chesapeake College, said. \"It's a great experience for the students to really learn about community service and helping others. I've already had some really good feedback from the students about how much they enjoy it.\"\nStaff from Studio 107 Hair Salon in Kent Island and Edwards All Star Barbershop in Denton enjoyed providing free haircuts and styles at Resource Day, something both shops provide every year.\n\"There's no better feeling,\" Lisa Milligan, owner of Studio 107, said. \"You're helping people that are maybe down on their luck or they're just getting out of jail or they're just going for jobs. It's every aspect, older people that can't afford to get their hair cut especially in this economy. So it's great to give back.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hosler at 100 and counting\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 693\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — As Queen Anne's County High's boys soccer team prepared for its victory jog across the field Wednesday night, a handful of Lions coaxed head coach Wade Hosler to find a place in line and join the run.Hosler made it halfway across the field then started applauding.\n\"It's senior night,\" he said. \"Let them have it.\"\nIt was also the night Hosler earned his 100th career victory, as Jamison Kendall's first-half goal proved enough in a 1-0 victory over a no-quit North Dorchester bunch, keeping the Lions atop the North Bayside.\n\"I guess it means I'm getting old,\" said a smiling Hosler of his milestone. \"I didn't really sit down and think about it too much. It's been a lot of tremendous players, a lot of great assistant coaches, administration. A lot of people have helped me along the way.\n\"It's been an amazing journey,\" continued Hosler, now in his 13th season at the helm. \"We have great kids. They come out and they work hard every year. We graduate good kids, and good kids fill their shoes. So it's a good place to be. If it wasn't I wouldn't have lasted this long.\"\nWith their fourth win in five games, the Lions (5-3 overall, 5-0 North Bayside) remained in first place in the division via their fourth one-goal win of the season.\n\"It's always a little stressful,\" Hosler said of senior night. \"We didn't finish the ball, which makes it difficult. We finish a couple more early (chances) and it would be a different game. But we don't put the ball in the back of the net and it becomes a struggle.\"\nQueen Anne's got four corner-kick chances in the opening 15 minutes but couldn't convert. And though the Lions controlled possession for much of the first half, the Eagles (4-4-1, 1-4-1) found openings and opportunities, the biggest coming with 26 minutes, 18 seconds remaining, when Christian Chase drilled a strike off the crossbar.\nThe Lions cranked up the intensity on the offensive end, with James Rath sending a pair of shots on goal that North Dorchester keeper Jayden Coleman stopped. But with just under 18 minutes left before half, the Lions worked the ball down the right side and over to Kendall, who steered a left-footed shot past Coleman for a 1-0 lead.\n\"We had good pressure,\" Eagles head coach Gabe Guzman said. \"It's one of those nights where things don't fall your way and you have to live with the results. Unfortunately, we had one mistake in the back end.\"\nQueen Anne's continued building chances toward padding its lead in the second half. Coleman stopped Trey Moore's header with 27:27 to go. Kendall was denied with 13:30 remaining and Rath unloaded a drive wide left 2 minutes later.\nNorth Dorchester pushed into the Lions end in the final 5 minutes in a bid for the equalizer. Senior captain Chris Sanchez, who booted a number of long clears and balls into the Queen Anne's end throughout the game, drove a direct kick wide left with a little over 5 minutes left. The Eagles got a corner with 3 minutes to go, but couldn't muster a shot.\nAbout a minute later, the Eagles sent a through ball into the box. But Lions sophomore keeper Braeden Livingston sprinted off his line and scooped the ball before anyone else could get a touch.\n\"It makes it stressful,\" Hosler said of his team's one-goal wins. \"But hey, we're playing well. We're still undefeated in the North. And I'm proud of the way we grind. It's not pretty. We're not finishing as many opportunities as we would like, but we keep grinding. We keep fighting. And we find a way to win.\"\nGuzman also liked his team's fight, and with a little work, hopes to be a force in the Class 1A East playoffs.\n\"We're still working things out,\" said Guzman, whose team is 4-1-1 against 1A competition this season. \"Finishing is still a little bit of an issue. It's a work in progress. Hopefully come playoff time we won't have that issue.\n\"Kudos to them,\" Guzman added of Hosler and Queen Anne's. \"Hundredth win. That's a wonderful feat. Hopefully one day I'll be there. But they did their job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton leans away from annexing new land in comprehensive plan update\n\n September 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As planners draft Easton's new comprehensive plan, the town's direction on annexing new land is becoming clear: slow down.At a workshop Monday, the Easton Planning Commission chose to retain language in the comprehensive plan update that discourages new annexations in the next 10 years.\nAs recently as last year, Easton annexed around 17 acres of county land east of U.S. Route 50 between the Royal Farms and Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. It's expected to become an affordable housing project, though the developer will still need town approval on an application.\nTown Council members have indicated concerns about annexing additional land into town, especially as Easton deals with the question of whether it's maxing out on residential growth.\nThe comprehensive plan, last updated in 2010, is undergoing revisions before potential council approval later this year or early next year. It outlines how the town aims to grow in the next decade, touching on areas such as annexation, population growth and traffic.\nOn Monday and at a workshop last month, commission and council members noted that there may be exceptions to the no-annexation rule.\n\"I would have a hard time with being absolute about annexation, saying that that's not happening,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Robert Rankin said on Aug. 25. \"Because there may be exceptions.\"\nThe main exception to completely halting annexation seems to be Easton Point, the development project that seeks to revitalize Port Street and the area around the Tred Avon River. The effort hasn't significantly progressed in recent years, council members say.\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said at last month's meeting that Easton Point's redevelopment is \"an enigma.\" She advocated that annexation of the county land in that area be excluded from any no-annexation directive in the new comprehensive plan.\n\"The Easton Point development project's been on the board for almost 20 years,\" Curry said. \"We have to find a way to move that forward if we can.\"\nTown leaders largely agreed that a project like Easton Point rises to the level of an \"extraordinary\" annexation that should be permitted under the comprehensive plan's guidance.\nStill, the plan should emphasize that annexation generally is \"not a priority for the town,\" said Planning Commission member Victoria McAndrews on Monday.\nGROWTH RATE\nHesitation to approve future annexation requests stems, in part, from the town's growth. From 2000 to 2010, the town's population increased 36%, according to census data. In the next decade, growth slowed to 7%, bringing Easton's population from 15,945 to 17,101.\nWhen commission and council members met for a joint workshop in August, the council maintained that the comprehensive plan should include a target growth rate for population. The 2010 version has a 1% annual growth rate, which for the most part hasn't been exceeded. Bumping it up to 1.75% was discussed.\nMichael Ports, the commission's vice chair, said Monday that 1.75% \"makes the most sense.\" But other commission members leaned toward a 1.14% annual growth rate, which is based off of historical trends.\nCommission Chairperson Phil Toussaint agreed with the 1.14% rate, emphasizing that it needs to be at a mark so the Town Council feels comfortable approving the plan as a whole.\nTRAFFIC\nWhen housing projects come to the commission or Town Council for approval, they include traffic impact studies. Developers typically hire a traffic engineering firm to conduct the study of the development's potential impact on traffic backups.\nPlanning Commission members said moving forward, the comprehensive plan needs to demand more thorough traffic reviews. Klein said studies often choose a few intersections next to the project and ignore the town's main arteries, where traffic is already an issue.\nEaston Planning and Zoning Director Miguel Salinas said the best way to expand the scope of a traffic impact study for a development is if town engineers or the State Highway Administration request a larger scope during meetings with the project's traffic engineer.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said he wants to continue requiring developers' traffic studies to include a percent change in traffic based on if the development were to be built.\nToussaint said he wants the studies to include more consideration on the impact to pedestrians, not just vehicles. He added that studies should be framed around the town's ongoing Complete Streets study, which is assessing Easton's roads on a large scale.\n\"What we've received in the past as a traffic impact study is going to be worthless for us going forward,\" Toussaint said. \"It's propaganda at this point, prepared by the applicant's engineers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carroll said his last day as city manager will be no later than May 17.\nCommissioner Jameson Harrington made the motion to adopt the ordinance with a language amendment regarding the incorporators.\nAt a council meeting Feb. 26, Thomas said that to his knowledge, Cambridge would be the first municipality in the State of Maryland to establish a land bank.\nHe also said that because the land bank authority would be a corporation, it would be able to acquire and sell land \"a little bit more nimbly\" than the government because the authority wouldn't have to follow the same process outlined in Cambridge's charter.\nBefore the council voted unanimously to adopt the amended ordinance at the March 25 meeting, Harrington thanked Carroll and city staff for making the project happen.\n\"It's something I've pushed for since being elected,\" he said. \"And it's really cool to see some progress.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘A dumping ground’: Despite new state regulations, Caroline County still wrestling with impacts of DAF residuals\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — When walking around his Ridgely residence and the Tuckahoe State Park, Al Martinez holds grave worries about the health of his neighbors and the environment.As president of the Tuckahoe Equestrian Center, he's mindful of the cleanliness of riding trails throughout the park, along with the park's bodies of water. Martinez's concerns for the environment led him to join other Caroline County residents who publicly spoke out regarding tanks storing \"food processing residuals.\"\nHe has taken notice of the large companies outside of the state that often bring the materials to Maryland. It's a trend he doesn't want to see harm the park or Adkins Arboretum, a 400-acre native garden across from his house.\n\"Big name companies with big pocketbooks are quietly paying other agents to get this stuff into our state,\" Martinez said. \"We kind of know that, even though it's not said so. We know that Big Brother with big money is behind all this.\"\nDissolved air flotation, a method for processing wastewater from food processing plants, leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals. State legislation, which referred to the material as \"food processing residuals,\" went into effect July 1. It requires a permit to use, store or haul the material.\nWhile the state's actions will bring some relief, county leaders still are grappling with mitigating the health and environmental drawbacks of the materials. Those drawbacks include increased flies and pungent odors for neighbors, along with the potential for polluted waterways.\nOn the Eastern Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge. In Maryland, it is an approved soil amendment or fertilizer.\nAccording to a 2023 study by the University of Maryland, more than half of the industrial sludge land-applied in Maryland in recent years came from other states.\nSince December, Caroline County leaders have held packed public hearings and extended moratoriums on DAF storage tanks. For county commissioners, the main hurdle has been cracking down on a few \"bad actors\" that store the residuals irresponsibly.\nMartinez and his wife, Stacy Frank, each commented at a January hearing on DAF residuals in Caroline County.\n\"The sludge created by this process emits the foulest, nauseating, noxious stench you have ever smelled,\" Frank wrote to county commissioners.\nThe turnout for that January meeting was more than significant — it was historically high, with nearly 70 pieces of spoken and written testimony. It caught the attention of state legislators, who raised the issue during this year's General Assembly.\nTHE STATE BILL\nHouse Bill 991 and its paired Senate Bill 1074 were signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore on May 9. The legislation doesn't prohibit the usage of food processing residuals by farmers, but it requires a permit to store, use or haul the food processing residuals.\nThe bills introduce increased penalties for those who willfully violate Maryland's nutrient management regulations and allow the state to inspect any site where residuals are used.\nWhile HB991 was introduced and sponsored by delegates on the western shore, Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) also introduced DAF-related legislation in February.\nHis legislation aimed to give local jurisdictions the authority to regulate storage of DAF residuals. Ghrist eventually withdrew his legislation, stating in a letter to Del. Marc Korman (D-Montgomery) that HB991 would \"give the necessary control to local governing bodies.\"\nThe now-signed bill gives responsibility for the permitting program to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\nThe MDA program is expected to be self-sufficient by collecting fees to support the program's funds.\nHolly Porter, executive director of the Delmarva Chicken Association, said DCA supported the final version of the bill and was \"pleased to see\" the permitting process fall under MDA's purview.\n\"We wanted to make sure that all of our farmers had the ability to utilize food processing residuals because it is a great source of nutrients,\" Porter said. \"… It's an organic material, and it's really one of the best forms of recycling you can do. And it lowers input costs for our grain farmers, which is very important in today's economy.\"\nThe exact extent of the benefits of land-applying DAF residuals isn't always agreed upon between industry and environmental experts.\nMatt Pluta, the Choptank riverkeeper at ShoreRivers, said that DAF could have \"such little available nutrients for the crops,\" causing it to often be applied in large quantities at once.\n\"Because this material is often applied in large quantities, we have concerns over the potential of runoff,\" Pluta said, adding that the waters on the Shore are already polluted due to other agricultural forms of runoff.\nAlan Girard, Maryland advocacy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, emphasized the importance that the state caught up to neighboring Virginia and Delaware in regulating the residuals. Companies from those areas had been trucking the product to a less-restricted state like Maryland.\n\"It's really sort of created a dumping ground for the material in Maryland (that is) generated elsewhere,\" Girard said.\nPERMIT PROCESS\nHans Schmidt, assistant secretary of resource conservation at the Department of Agriculture, said the department worked with sponsors of the bill, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Shore Rivers and more groups during the legislative process. The department drafted regulations and presented them to MDA's Nutrient Management Advisory Committee.\nGirard said \"the department deserves a lot of credit\" for its work on drafting regulations to satisfy the bill, which officially took effect July 1.\n\"The department will know ahead of time when and where these products are going to be applied,\" Schmidt said. \"… We have authority now to go on the farms where these products (are) without prior approval from the landowner.\"\nSince the time between the bill passing and the July 1 effective date was limited, Schmidt clarified that the final permit regulations are not active. Instead, the department finalized a set of emergency regulations that was sent to a state legislative committee.\nThe emergency regulations, posted on MDA's website, will be effective once approved by that administrative, executive and legislative review joint committee. Those regulations will last for six months, during which MDA will submit proposed final regulations, Schmidt said.\n\"Hopefully by Jan. 1, the proposed regulations will be approved,\" he added.\nPorter said the Delaware Chicken Association offered suggestions to the first draft of regulations, adding that the group is \"very much engaged\" in conversation with MDA.\nIn a recent Caroline County Commissioners meeting on July 9, Porter said she believes the state regulations aim to ensure \"tracking, reporting and accountability.\" However, she added that the emergency regulations — which are currently being reviewed by the joint committee — \"still (have) some things we're a little concerned on.\"\n\"It's more restrictive than I'm sure the industry likes,\" Schmidt said. \"But I think it still meets the intent as far as limiting the number of applications that these products can be applied to the land.\"\n'BAD ACTORS'\nWhile not opposed to the usage of food processing residuals, the Caroline County commissioners have taken significant steps in the past year to aleve concerns from residents like Martinez and Frank. Many of the complaints relate to odors and flies.\nCounty resident Russ Yates owns Holiday Park Campground near Greensboro and has expressed concerns during public hearings about the prospect of using the structures at a neighboring former dairy farm to store DAF. He doesn't want non-permitted materials stored next to his campground and corn fields.\nCommission President Travis Breeding said the problem became apparent last winter as the yearly deadline for permitted land application of DAF residuals neared. From Dec. 15 to March 1, the residuals cannot be land-applied under state law, which is the reason for much of the DAF storage.\n\"There was a mad dash to get as much of this material out on the fields as they could get on the fields up until that Dec. 15 cutoff,\" Breeding said. \"And then they started to store this material in these structures.\"\nBreeding said that trend led the county to call meetings over the winter to discuss placing moratoriums on the storage of DAF residuals. Moratoriums are still in place until later this fall.\n\"We knew that we had to be well educated in this decision … because of how important the industry is to our local economy,\" Breeding said. \"But just because an industry is a vital part of your economy doesn't give them the right to become a nuisance. We had to try to balance that.\"\nAt a July 9 county commission meeting, a county bill to create a food processing residuals storage permit was introduced. Notably, if passed, it would require closed-top storage, going a step further than the state's recently introduced regulations.\nDuring the meeting, Breeding said he visited a Goldsboro resident who \"had never experienced flies like that before\" due to nearby food processing residuals.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Delmarva Chicken Association and as a Denton resident, Porter expressed disappointment with the legislation and raised concerns that it'll hurt the agriculture and poultry industries.\n\"You potentially open up the door that five years or 10 years from now, people are going to come in and complain about other odors (and flies),\" Porter said.\nIn an interview with The Star Democrat, Porter said part of the reason for her opposition to the county legislation is that it \"does not grandfather in\" farmers who use open-top storage.\n\"I don't anticipate that our elected officials are experts in all things,\" Porter said to the commission, \"… but I do expect our commissioners to be leaders. As leaders, you don't manage to the exception and develop a policy for one person.\"\nPorter has emphasized that the vast majority of farmers store and apply the residuals properly. \"We had a bad actor in this county,\" she later said.\n\"It's more than one,\" Commissioner Frank Bartz responded.\nBreeding, who has previously acknowledged that he expects \"players from the poultry industry\" to \"have heartburn\" with county legislation, admitted to Porter during the meeting that he believes they are \"a ways apart\" on the debate.\nAt a Caroline County Planning Commission meeting on July 10, the legislation passed with two yes votes from Breeding and Chair Jeff Jackson. Hannah Cawley, the commission's vice chair, voted no, while commission member Keith Bilbrough abstained.\nThe bill will return to the desk of the Caroline County Commissioners on Aug. 6 for a public hearing.\n\"It is still an issue for a lot of residents in the county,\" Breeding said at the July 9 meeting. \"… That is why we have taken a very hard-line stance that you're not going to be allowed to affect your neighbors.\"\nVeronica Fernandez-Alvarado contributed to this story.\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated the date of the Caroline County Commissioners public hearing. The hearing will be held on Aug. 6 at 9:15 a.m. in the Health & Public Services Building in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He has flown the F-15, F-22 and A-10 and is currently the deputy commander of the 175th Wing, Maryland Air National Guard.\nHe and his family live in North Beach.\nThe 30-page book retails for $39 — the eBook is $34 — and is available at https://bookstore.dorrancepublishing.com/.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?It was [Sudbury, Mass.- based Josiah Haynes Elementary School teacher Lee] Jones, my fourth grade and to this day, favorite teacher, who inspired me to be a writer. Despite my rambunctious nature which was not ideally suited to being a student, he managed to tease out a bit of creativity. I must have a penchant for alliterative titles because my favorite project that year was story about a Viking named Pudgy Pinkinson. Yet I think my path was set when Mr. Jones assigned us to create an auto-biography, the last chapter being a prediction of what we would be in the future. In that last chapter I said I would go to the Air Force Academy, become a fighter pilot, and finally become an author. Thus far the first two have come true and I suppose that \"Marty McSwirl\" is the first step towards making the latter come to fruition.\nWhat inspires you to write?My children John, Anna and Andrew and a lone, tired-looking squirrel inspired me to write \"Marty McSwirl.\" Years ago, I had just finished raking leaves and the kiddos immediately began rollicking in the pile, exactly the way kids should. Despite the chaos, a squirrel joined the fray, apparently looking for acorns. I thought to myself, \"He must be a tired dad squirrel gathering food for a big family,\" and thus was born \"Marty McSwirl\".\nDo you consider writing to be a career?Not yet, but like my fourth grade autobiography predicted, I hope it will be one day.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?I sit down at my grandmother's old roll-top desk, slide a piece of paper into my nearly 100-year old Royal typewriter, and tap away. I started using a typewriter years ago after reading an opinion in the newspaper lamenting the lost art of letter-writing. Sharing an admiration for things that have stood the test of time, I determined to resurrect that lost art, yet my handwriting is terrible. So I bought an old typewriter and now, when I sit down in front of the Royal, I drift away to wherever my imagination leads me.\nHow did you publish your book?\nAfter writing \"Marty McSwirl,\" it lay dormant for years, gathering dust among the pile of unpublished works in a desk drawer. Eventually, I applied for a copyright through the Library of Congress and once granted, a number of publishing companies contacted me asking if I would like to publish. I ended up choosing Dorrance Publishing, who walked me through the project.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?Julia Donaldson is the first author who comes to mind. I've been reading to the kids every night since birth and they always responded best to books that told a good story in the form of a poem. When I began writing \"Marty McSwirl\" it was with my kids in mind, hoping to create a book that I could one day read to them before bed.\nWhat are you working on now?I have a few unpublished works ready for an eager illustrator and book agent.\nPlease include a brief description of your bookMarty McSwirl is the tale of a squirrel who invents an acorn harvester with the help of some friends. Their efforts meet with success and Marty decides to share the fruits of his labor with family, friends and neighbors. In essence, the story is a woodland creature Thanksgiving origin story.\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\"When Marty came back with his acorn sack at the end of each long day,\nMrs. McSwirl was there with a hug,\nHis children snuggled upon the rug,\nBut despite all his care, the cupboard lay bare, he must find an easier way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "2025 resolution: Get involved. Be part of solution\n\n December 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Well, it has been a while since I have written. While we were in the process of moving to a retirement community, at least two important things have happened for Cambridge. They are the mayoral election and the governor's ENOUGH Act grant award to Moving Dorchester Forward for Cambridge and Dorchester County.The election occurred on our moving day, and I was happy to have had the chance to vote for Lajan Cephas, the mayor-elect. The ENOUGH Act award occurred about a week later. Each are steps forward for a community that has had its challenges but is now on a positive path.\nTo keep things continuing to move in the right direction, many things must happen. The one thing that the Cambridge and Dorchester communities need to do to help ensure that things continue to move in the right direction is to become involved. That means you.\nThe political process and governance do not mean that the people that are routinely impacted by them simply take a step back, claim that their job is done because they voted and let those elected or fulfilling the obligations of state or federal grants to simply do their work without communicating with and reporting to the public.\nThat means for the work of the new City Council and the mayor you need to go to the meetings or at least watch them on Town Hall streams. Those meetings are recorded so you can watch them any time. You can also join CAN, the Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods, and become involved that way. The city provides over the internet the agendas for all its public meetings including supporting documents for some of them.\nWith the ENOUGH Act grant and other grants that the city receives from the state and federal governments, for that money to benefit the community it needs to be used correctly and spent in such a way that the community benefits and more funding can become available. For instance, the grant awarded to Moving Dorchester Forward is meant to help Cambridge and Dorchester County develop a program to address child poverty and be awarded an even larger implementation grant of up to $5 million.\nIn this grant cycle, three Maryland communities were able to receive grants of $3 million each because of the work that they had already done. The work of the Moving Dorchester Forward team has only just begun. If you participate in a nonprofit addressing children's issues or a church community, find out more about where and when they are meeting and what is being done.\nWhy do you need to do this?\nBecause if you do not, you will receive information from friends and family or others from social media that will be inaccurate, biased or intended to lead you to think differently than the facts can show if you are personally involved. Our society has become too lazy and relies on what someone else tells them as we make our decisions about who to elect or who we want to be appointed to a committee or board that addresses issues of interest to the community.\nGlenn Steckman, the new city manager, is eager to hear from you and to speak with and listen to community groups to learn more from you about your concerns so that city staff and the Cambridge Police Department can be more responsive to what is happening or not happening in the community.\nFor instance, I know that juvenile delinquency is often a topic of discussion. Here is a link to a police report on juvenile delinquency in Cambridge from almost a year ago, choosecambridge.com/DocumentCenter/View/2422/Juvenile-report.\nAnother link is from a fall 2024 crime report found at choosecambridge.com/DocumentCenter/View/2580/2024Q3-Public-Report- It will show you on Page 28 what the juvenile statistics are for the city.\nIf you want to learn more, you can attend the city police advisory committee meetings that happen on a regular basis and are open to the public. Get involved. Be part of the solution. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton Town Council vote on cannabis moratorium delayed - Tabled measure leads to heated discussion among council members\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A move by Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus to continue a hearing on a proposed cannabis moratorium drew strong reactions from other council members.A tense back-and-forth exchange between Gunsallus and Ward 3 Councilman David Montgomery toward the end of Monday's council meeting stemmed from the council president's executive decision to delay a vote on the moratorium for an additional three weeks.The nine-month moratorium on cannabis businesses, introduced this summer, was originally slated for a public hearing and vote at the council's Sept.18 meeting. The matter had been tabled until Monday so all five council members could be present to vote.The moratorium, if passed, would place a pause on applications, approval, construction, expansion, processing or issuance of building permits for a business that grows, processes or sells cannabis within the Easton town limits.The moratorium would also allow the town to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance.Easton's existing zoning ordinance already contains definitions and permitted zoning districts for medical cannabis dispensaries and growing and processing facilities, but does not include language on standards for recreational facilities.Montgomery strongly objected to Gunsallus' continuance, saying the council president did not have the authority to do so. Gunsallus affirmed that he did.\"Sir, you will contain yourself please,\" Gunsallus said, speaking over Montgomery, who started to make a comment.Gunsallus reaffirmed he had the power to continue discussion on the moratorium until the next meeting, explaining that he wanted to wait until the town's planning commission made an additional recommendation later in the week.However, in August, the commission unanimously gave a favorable recommendation to approve the ordinance.Montgomery called for a vote on the continuance, questioning Gunsallus' authority.\"The fact that four of us could reveal that we want to vote now means nothing to you, that you will override the wishes of the council because you are sitting there as the town council president,\" he said.Town Attorney Sharon Van Emburgh chimed in, saying the council can override the president's action. But in the past, the council has typically given members additional time to vote as a courtesy.Montgomery pointed out that the council had already given an additional month for consideration.Gunsallus reemphasized the upcoming planning commission meeting would provide more clarifying information.\"Excuse me, what information will that be?\" Montgomery said.\"(The planning commission's) recommendations, as I've stated, so please contain yourself - you've already spoken more than permissible,\" Gunsallus said.Montgomery motioned to overrule Gunsallus and vote on the ordinance as presented.Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello interjected, saying while he understood Montgomery and \"definitely\" disagreed with how the decision had been handled, he agreed that granting additional time to decide was in line with past council actions.Mayor Megan Cook, a former council president herself, interrupted the quarreling, calling for the councilmen to settle down.\"I agree that we are a group of five where you all are independent and you all have various opinions - absolutely.We must respect ourselves - the fighting, we need to\" she said, trailing off and moving her arms to motion to calm down.\"Please.\" Ward 4 Councilman Rev.Elmer Davis Jr. initially seconded the motion, rescinding his vote just minutes later to agree with Abbatiello's stance on the council's precedent. He voiced worry with how the situation was handled.\"We have never had such a dialogue that we had tonight regarding issues and concerns,\" he said. \"That dialogue - I'm quite concerned about things that have been said, I've never seen this on this council in all my days.\" The council will again table voting on the ordinance until its Monday, Nov. 6, meeting.Uncertainty still remains on the moratorium. During Monday's meeting, council members and town residents raised questions on the moratorium's duration, specifics on licensing for both recreational and medical facilities and zoning laws for both types of establishments.The Easton Planning Commission will discuss zoning requirements for adult-use cannabis dispensaries at its Thursday, Oct. 19, meeting. \n \n Caption: COURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Town Council President Frank Gunsallus pauses his comments during a tense moment at the Monday, Oct. 16 council meeting.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nWard 3 Councilman David Montgomery, left, prepares to make a comment during a tense exchange at a council meeting Monday, Oct. 16.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook gestures with her hands for the council members to settle down. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So we've brought it to the commissioners' attention because it's long overdue.\"\nThe commissioners' annual pay is $15,000, and the commissioners president makes $16,000. This figure is similar to some surrounding counties. According to the Talbot County charter, county council members make $14,400 per year.\nCompensation is much higher in other Maryland counties. The Montgomery County Council president makes $171,912, while other council members make $156,284.\nCommissioners Vice President Larry Porter had some questions about the draft bill and how the committee would properly calculate the hours the commissioners work.\n\"I think the question that I would have would be, I'm not sure that committee would be able to really understand or have information on the hours,\" Porter said. \"I mean we all serve differently.\n\"For example, the president of the commissioners is asked to do things that the other members are not. In other words, the president represents the commissioners… there's hours in here that we don't, I don't know if this committee would even recognize or understand.\"\nBarroll made a suggestion that Kim Raeder of the Office of Law help make the appointments to the committee. Barroll said committee members could interview the commissioners to make a proper evaluation.\nThe commissioners will not have a say in whether their compensation is raised or not. The appointed committee will make a recommendation after its investigation into the work of the commissioners.\nThe committee would have to report back by Dec. 15, and the commissioners would have 60 days to act on the recommendation.\nThe commissioners voted to introduce the draft bill that would create the committee and move the legislation to a first reading at their next meeting. If the bill is passed, Barroll and Commissioners President Travis Breeding said the committee is likely to be formed in early November. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cardin threatens to end military sales to Egypt\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Fatema Hosseini; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has announced plans to block future U.S. military aid and arms sales to Egypt unless that country shows \"concrete, meaningful, and sustainable steps\" to improve its human rights record.\"It is imperative that we continue to hold the government of Egypt, and all governments, accountable for their human rights violations,\" Cardin said in a statement.Cardin's decision marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Egypt, a long-standing ally in the Middle East.The senator plans to block $235 million in foreign military assistance that the Biden administration approved on Sept.14.The move starkly contrasts with the actions of Cardin's predecessor, Sen.Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, who was indicted Sept. 22 for allegedly accepting bribes to influence U.S. policy in favor of the Egyptian government.Cardin's action is colliding with the Biden administration's efforts to foster closer ties with Egypt.State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said in a press briefing Wednesday that the United States aims to advance a strategic partnership with Egypt that ensures regional security and fosters significant progress on human rights issues.Patel added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken believes waiving certain conditions for Egypt's foreign military financing in fiscal 2022 aligned with U.S. national security interests.A total of $1.215 billion in military aid has been allocated for Egypt and discussions with Congress and Egyptian partners are ongoing, Patel said.\"I was very open in my disappointment in the administration using the waiver on the use of funds, but I want to have a chance to meet with the administration,\" Cardin told Politico.Before assuming his current role, Cardin had criticized the Biden administration for overriding a human rights prohibition on $320 million of military aid to Egypt.He was among a group of senators, including independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware that urged the Biden administration to withhold the $320 million from Egypt.The senators argued that the Egyptian government had failed to make \"meaningful progress in addressing human rights concerns\" and that withholding the funds was \"required by law\" in the fiscal 2022 spending bill.In a July 28 letter to Blinken, the senators charged that the Egyptian government had \"not only failed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, it has also continued to commit 'significant human rights' violations such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture and life-threatening prison conditions, and severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as documented in the State Department's latest human rights report.\" According to Amnesty International, Egyptian authorities severely restrict civil liberties, including freedom of expression and assembly.In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022, 895 political prisoners were released but nearly triple that number were arrested, according to Amnesty International.\"Sexual and gender-based violence remained prevalent, amid the authorities' failure to adequately prevent and punish it,\" Amnesty International said. Workers' rights and religious freedoms are also suppressed, and refugees are mistreated.The decision to freeze aid could have geopolitical implications.As a result of the aid hold, \"the anti-America(n) camp will be empowered domestically,\" Haisam Hassanein, an adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Jewish Insider.He predicted that the group would publicly push for Egypt to strengthen its relations with Russia and China.\"This could force President (Abdel Fattah El-) Sisi in his current election campaign to release some (inflammatory) statements to save face in front of his constituents,\" Hassanein said.On Wednesday, Cardin also announced plans to halt security assistance to Azerbaijan due to its \"brutal campaign\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, effectively erasing its Armenian population.Cardin emphasized the need to document war crimes and atrocities and to support efforts to repatriate prisoners of war.He called for increased humanitarian support for ethnic Armenians who have left Nagorno-Karabakh and for the United States to continue supporting democratic reforms in Armenia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is a member of the Easton Rotary Club and works with Disaster Aid USA, a nonprofit that delivers disaster relief worldwide.\n\"Over the past term, I have had the privilege of working alongside dedicated council members, community leaders, and residents who are passionate about shaping Easton's future,\" Gunsallus wrote in an email to The Star Democrat. \"The trust placed in me to lead our town council is both humbling and inspiring, and I believe there is more work to be done to ensure Easton remains a vibrant, welcoming, and prosperous community.\"\nThe current president will have at least one opponent, as Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello announced his candidacy for the head council seat earlier this week. Abbatiello has been the Ward 2 representative since 2019.\nGunsallus says his main priorities if reelected are public safety and infrastructure, affordable housing, community engagement and economic development. On the topic of housing, he said it's an \"ongoing challenge\" and the town's making \"significant strides.\"\nIn 2023, Gunsallus won a special election for the presidential seat after previous president Megan Cook assumed the town's mayoral seat. At 35, he began his term as the youngest council president in Easton's history.\nWith more than a year under his belt, Gunsallus said he's learned \"the immense value of collaboration and listening.\"\n\"I have learned that effective leadership requires balancing the immediate needs of the community with a long-term vision for sustainable growth,\" Gunsallus wrote. \"This role has also reinforced the importance of adaptability and resilience, especially when navigating the challenges that come with governing a dynamic town like Easton.\"\nIn addition to council president, there will be Ward 2 and Ward 4 elections this spring. The filing deadline for candidates is April 7. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The quintet includes pianist Sahun Sam Hong, violinists, Abi Fayette and Stephanie Zyzak, violist, Luther Warren, and cellist, Zachary Mowitz. Chesapeake Chamber Music patrons will remember Sahun Sam Hong and Zachary Mowitz as members of the Trio St. Bernard, the 2018 Lerman Gold Prize winner of the Chesapeake Chamber Music Competition\" the Easton-based music nonprofit said in a press release promoting the performance.\n\"I'm particularly excited for ensemble/132 to bring this delightfully eclectic program to Chesapeake Music. It shows so much of what chamber music can be. Every piece has something entirely unique to offer, whether it's Haydn's exquisitely and cleverly crafted trio, a dramatic cast of characters such as those in Schumann's Carnaval, Perkinson's thrilling blend of a jazz idiom with a classical approach to counterpoint and form, or Petrouchka with its timeless story, its folk dances, and its symphonic scope. It doesn't hurt that Sam's arrangements — Carnaval and Petrouchka — capture the essence of these wonderful pieces while bringing a new palette of colors that we all get to explore together,\" Cellist Zachary Mowitz said.\nEnsemble/132 is comprised of eleven chamber musicians. Marcy Rosen, Artistic Director of Chesapeake Music, is the artistic advisor to ensemble/132.\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, please visit the Chesapeake Music website at https://chesapeakemusic.org.

But Tuesday, the commissioners made it clear that they were not quite ready to sign on.\nCaroline County Commissioners proposed a regional authority to manage the detention center, which is not mentioned in the drafter agreement.\n\"The item that we are still trying to hammer out is the agreement, we were under the impression that we were going to form a regional authority to manage the detention center,\" County Administrator Katheleen Freeman said.\nThe majority of the authority over the center will be in Queen Anne's County hands, according to the draft. All decisions and disagreement must go through Queen Anne's County Commissioners, and if they may have a disagreement it will be mediated.\nThe Caroline County commissioners also expressed concerns about the autonomy and authority of the the new facility's warden. According to the draft agreement, \"The Board shall appoint a Warden to operate the Facility with the consent of the County Commissioners of Queen Anne's County.\"\nThe draft agreement also states that \"The Warden's contract shall not be terminated without the Board's consent\"\nThe commissioners voiced that they believed under the draft that Queens Anne's county could decide after a certain amount of time to remove Caroline or Kent county from agreement, regardless of the amount of money that was put up. To remove one or both of the other counties from the agreement, according to the draft, Queen Anne's County must give the other county a two-year notice to take all their prisoners and house them somewhere else.\nThe commissioners said they understood Queen Anne's County's decision to conduct the draft agreement this way, but they requested further negotiation and discussion to establish a partnering jurisdiction.\n\"It was never really any discussion by the prospective members that we would form an authority or develop this regional detention center via agreement with our partner jurisdiction,\" Freeman said.\nCaroline County believes that the draft agreement can work, but before they sign on, changes must be made. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are so proud of and inspired by the veterans and service members on our team. This is just a great opportunity to honor them and let them know what they mean, n to us.\"In addition to lighting buildings and other meaningful landmarks, residents, businesses and other organizations are encouraged to participate by simply changing one light bulb in their home to a green bulb.This can be an exterior light that neighbors and passersby see or an interior light that sparks a conversation with friends.\"Operation Green Light is a gesture of support and appreciation for the public service of our veterans,\" said NACo Executive Director Matthew Chase. \"With hundreds of towns and counties coming together to light everything from bridges to courthouses, we know veterans across the country will see and feel the gratitude we all feel for their service and sacrifices.\"Counties and residents across the country are sharing their participation on social media using the hashtag #OperationGreenLight.For more information on Operation Green Light, visit https://veterans.mary-land.go v/op e ration-g reen-light/. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Port Street Commons, a project led by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, is slated to finish construction in October.The project includes nine apartments — seven two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units — and approximately 10,000 square feet of space for The Arc's new regional headquarters, featuring offices and a behavioral health suite.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Jonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc, gave a tour of the 24,000-square-foot space to Jake Day, Maryland's secretary of housing and community development.\nConstruction workers were in action on the site, and drywall and insulation was installed on the first and second floors of the three-story building. Day called it a \"great looking building.\"\nRondeau pointed out the importance of bringing immediate assistance to those in need of housing in the Easton area, which is why his team has worked to aim for completion in under four years. The site was identified in July of 2021, and construction began last June. \"We want to move quickly,\" Rondeau said.\n$6.5 million of the project's approximate $11-million price tag has been raised, and The Arc is nearing the end of its capital campaign. Rondeau told Day that The Arc is financing the gap of around $4.5 million.\n\"If we wanted to raise the full $11 million, that would've taken us about eight years,\" Rondeau said.\nDay was impressed with the pace of the Port Street project, asking Rondeau, \"can we set you up with lots of other developers to help guide them through the process as speedily as The Arc has gotten through?\"\nA ribbon cutting is planned for Nov. 7. Rondeau said the first batch of tenants will move in Dec. 1, with a second batch coming in on Jan. 2. The Arc's headquarters will open in January.\nEight of the nine units will accept tenants based on a public lottery system. The ninth unit is designated to the Talbot Interfaith Shelter to house someone transitioning out of the shelter.\n\"Because of the site plan, all nine units are slightly different,\" Rondeau said, \"which was not the most economical, but it was the only way we could maximize getting nine units into the available square footage.\"\nAll of the units will feature free Wi-Fi and appliances including a microwave, along with \"solid surface countertops\" and carpet in bedrooms to save money in the back end for property management. The units will be managed by Chesapeake Neighbors, a housing subsidiary of The Arc.\nRondeau said two of the units on the first floor are \"universally designed,\" with accessible bathrooms and appliances meant to accommodate those with disabilities.\nAs Day and other members of the Department of Housing and Community Development toured the space, Rondeau pointed out how the office spaces will support The Arc's overarching goal of providing counseling and assistance to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nThe headquarters are expected to add around 35 jobs to the area. Rondeau said employees at the Easton site will have health insurance. A full-time nurse will also be in the building.\n\"Three years ago, The Arc decided to self-insure our health insurance for our employees,\" he said. \"And we have a partnership. We provide free urgent and primary care to all of our employees.\"\nRondeau is excited for The Arc's services to continue expanding outside of Anne Arundel County, which is where the organization was founded and has the largest presence.\n\"We've grown significantly over the last 25 years here in Easton,\" Rondeau said. \"We wanted to have an Eastern Shore headquarters.\"\nThe project is the first building in Easton to fall under the town's mixed-use waterfront zoning district regulations, Rondeau said. Passed in 2019, the zoning code emphasizes connecting the Easton Point waterfront to the town's downtown area. Rondeau said The Arc made sure to have the front doors of the project facing Port Street as part of the zoning expectations.\nAfter the tour, Day thanked Rondeau and expressed his support for The Arc's fast-moving efforts.\n\"It's an awesome project, it's an incredible project,\" Day said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Come to Tilghman\n\n August 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Business \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TILGHMAN ISLAND — When walking into Gina's at the Bridge, it is immediately clear who Gina Lee Werner is.Simply looking at the decor and tasting the unique blend of flavors on the menu tells the tale of the fun and eclectic restaurant owner who makes her staff feel like family, signing each check with a heart or \"love, Gina.\"\nHer husband, Michael Joseph Werner, calls it \"Ginafying.\"\nGina Lee Werner been a restaurant owner for over two decades, and the Werners opened Gina's at the Bridge in November. Now eight months in, the Werners have learned that getting out to Tilghman Island — miles past St. Michaels, where tourists usually stop — is worth the drive.\n\"I hear people all the time. They're like, 'oh, my God, it's so far. I just can't do that drive.' It's the extra 10 minutes passing St. Michaels, and it's just something about that drive,\" Michael said.\nIn an effort to encourage people to come to Tilghman and connect more local businesses, the Werners are purchasing a shuttle van, which can hold around 14 people. They plan to provide shuttle services from St. Michaels and beyond.\nThe current proposed name of the shuttle is \"The Tizzy.\" It will begin operation in next week.\nIn addition, the Werners are planning to purchase a center console boat to provide shuttle service on the water.\nGinafying Tilghman\nGina opened Gina's in St. Michaels in 2011, which she still runs. But she always wanted to buy the property she could operate out of.\nThe new restaurant is situated on Knapps Narrows right next to the historic Tilghman Island Drawbridge.\nIt is the busiest drawbridge in the nation, and on a nice summer day, the bridge could be raised up to 50 times, according to PropTalk Chesapeake Bay Boating.\nThe restaurant sources crabs, oysters and fish directly from local watermen, emphasizing extreme freshness while fostering strong community relationships on the island. Along with local seafood, the Werners make a point of collaborating with local artists and businesses like the Tilghman Island County Store and the Little Big Market.\nGina firmly believes in a \"rising tide raises all ships\" mentality.\nShe was inspired to open her first restaurant, Gina's Cantina, after a bad experience at a restaurant she formerly worked in where she didn't feel supported after returning from maternity leave.\n\"I was working all the way up until eight months pregnant, but I went back and everything changed,\" Gina said. \"It just fueled me.\"\n20 years later, that fuel remains ignited, but not out of spite. Her motivation is fostered through an environment where staff are happy yet hardworking and the customers love the food but also feel at home.\nTo Gina, it is more important to prioritize a relaxed customer experience, where guests can enjoy the view.\n\"I definitely believe that the restaurants have been such a way for me to put my heart out there so I can still do my art and I can also make a living because I'm not selling my art,\" Gina said. \"The art is when people come in and they're like, ah, yeah.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "READY TO ROAR - Lions eye repeat in tough North with designs on deep playoff run\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: William Haufe; bhaufe@chespub.com | Page: A32 | Section: Sports \n \n 1532\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There will be no rematch in the Bayside Conference volleyball championship this year.Oh, defending North and overall conference champion Queen Anne's County High should again be one of the Bayside's best. The other half of last year's title match, North Dorchester, hasn't exactly fallen on hard times, and also figures to have another strong season.But with volleyball returning to Mardela this season, North Dorchester was moved from the South Bayside to the North - where it competes in every other sport it has - making the division possibly as tough as it's ever been.\"Kent Island's pretty heavy,\" said Queen Anne's head coach Nevada Brice, who twice last season watched her team defeat the Bucs in five sets, including a come-from-behind victory in the Class 2A East Region II championship. \"And North Dorchester. I hope these other North Bayside teams don't forget about them.\" \"I think you're not going to have to count out Easton and North Caroline,\" Kent Island head coach Glenn Brainer said.\"And North Dorchester, for a smaller school she (head coach Carol Hubbard) does a great job.\" \"It should be very good,\" North Caroline head coach Amanda Vanskiver added of the North. \"Both good and terrifying.\" W hile North Dorchester will be a new opponent for the North's 2A schools, the division will also have a new face on the sideline this fall, as James Foo takes over as head coach at Easton after Jen Powell stepped down unexpectedly after 17 seasons.Here's a look at this year's teams.COLONEL RICHARDSONHead Coach: Lesley Staehli.Who's Where: Jazmine Meredith (Sr., SET/OH); Tyla Dickerson (Sr., OH); Eileen Johnson (Sr., MH); Kendall Sann (Sr., SET/H); Faith Thomas (Sr., DEF); Emily Burke (Sr., MH); Montana Davis (Jr., LIB); Kylie Rhinehart (Jr., OH); Madison Shufelt (Jr., SET); Anijah Hammond (Jr., SET/MH); Takaila Rich (Jr., OH); Alohna Lynch (Jr., SET); Kailey Cummings (Jr., MH); Jazmir Jackson (So., MH); Aubrey Taylor (So., DEF); Emma Brewer (So., DEF).Outlook: Staehli will look to build around Dickerson, Meredith and Johnson, who were all-North Bayside honorable-mention picks a year ago.A healthy portion of the squad was on the softball team that reached the 1A East Region I championship in the spring so they know how to win.\"The talent's there,\" Staehli said. \"Once they start clicking they're going to be good. They've just got to get rid of that softball swing. I've got all softball girls; (they need to) go to that volleyball swing. We'll get there.\"EASTONHead Coach: James Foo.Who's Where: Ayden Jimenez (Sr., OH); Bree Stevens (Jr., MH); Faith Walstrum (Sr., LIB); Kaleigh Hammond (Sr., MH); Siang Sama (Sr., OH); Taylor Rash (Sr., DEF); Hannah Webster (Sr., RSH); Parker Jimenez (So., SET); Mary Claire O'Connor (So., OH); Annie Whelan (Jr., RSH); Ava Beck (So., DEF); Kennedy Grove (Jr., DEF).Outlook: Sam Mason, the North Bayside's co-player of the year last season, has graduated, but Ayden Jimenez, Kaleigh Hammond and Bree Stevens, who all received all-North recognition last season, return.\"I'm very lucky. I have big shoes to fill taking over a very nice program that coach Powell has developed,\" Foo said. \"I'm working with a bunch of kids who are willing to learn. We're doing things a little bit different. I have a lot of new things that I'm showing them. I think we'll do quite well. But I guess it depends on how fast we are learning. I'm showing them a lot of stuff that they're not familiar with. But it's working.\" It worked during Tuesday's season opener, as the Warriors swept James M.Bennett, 25-16, 25-16, 25-11.KENT ISLANDHead Coach: Glenn Brainer.Who's Where: Kendra Coffey (Sr., SET); Lilli Dauses (Sr., MH); Taylor Harding (Sr., DEF); Melanie Murphy (Sr., LIB); MacKenzie Smith (Sr., MH); Rylie Corn (Jr., OH); Alaina Dlabich (Jr., SET/H); Abbigail Fisher (Jr., LIB); Gianna King (Jr., OH); Macayla Kirk (Jr., OH); Emiley Mayo (Jr., DEF); Gabby Polk (Jr., SET); Kennedy Quevedo (Jr., DEF); Lauren Wigglesworth (Jr., MH); Alana Van Ornum (So., OH).Outlook: The Bucs had Queen Anne's on the ropes twice last season before losing the regular-season finale and the 2A East Region II title match in five games.\"That's something we need to move on from,\" said Brainer, who begins his fifth year as head coach.Four starters return from last year's 11-4 team, including first-team All-North picks Dauses and Murphy.That duo along with fellow starters King and Kirk should again make Kent Island a contender in the North and region.\"We've got some talent,\" Brainer said. \"Whether we'll be as good as we were last year, I don't know. You never know how things are going to shake out.\"NORTH CAROLINEHead Coach: Amanda Vanskiver.Who's Where: Julie Christopher (Sr., SET); Anna Hutchison (Sr., RSH); Brooke Gauck (Sr., LIB); Morgan Rizer (Sr., MH); Julia Myers (Sr., OH); Riley Walstrum (Sr., OH); Ali Thomason (Sr., DEF); Mariah Price (Jr., RSH); Ashley Kercheval (Jr., MH); Tamara Holloway (So., MH).Outlook: \"We're ready I think,\" Vanskiver said.The Bulldogs graduated Zoe Fretterd, the North Bayside co-player of the year, but return seven seniors and five juniors, including Hutchison, an all-North first-team pick last season, and Rizer and Walstrum, who were also all-North choices.And though there's plenty of experience on the team, Vanskiver's biggest concern is avoiding a repeat of last year, when the Bulldogs had a tendency to fall behind early and play catch-up the rest of the match.\"They're starting off really strong, so I'm feeling really good,\" Vanskiver said. \"But we have to start strong every match. And be mentally tough.\"NORTH DORCHESTERHead Coach: Carol Hubbard.Who's Where: Maggie Hubbard (Sr., MH); Katelyn Hopkins (Jr., SET); Brooke Outten (Jr., OH); Emily Freeman (Jr., MH); Lexi Lednum (Jr., RSH); Maddie Nagel (Sr., OH); Mackenzie Lewis (Sr., LIB); Haleigh Leonard (Sr., OH); Zoey Willey (So., RSH); Jules Vroman (So., RSH); Alissa Bickling (So., OH).Outlook: The Eagles return six from last season's team that won its first 14 matches en route to winning its first division title before losing to Queen Anne's in the Bayside championship, and Snow Hill in the 1A East Region I final.\"I'll be honest with you I was a little apprehensive coming into this year,\" said Coach Hubbard, whose team finished 15-3 a year ago.\"But the girls have definitely stepped up and exceeded my expectations. I'm happy with what we've seen so far.\"QUEEN ANNE'sHead Coach: Nevada Brice.Who's Where: Autumn Huber (Sr., LIB); Baillie Pinder (Sr., MH); Caroline Taylor (Sr., OH); Kayce Titus (Sr., SET); Sydney Pinder (So., MH); Mackenzie Doyle (Sr., OH); Jensen Nutleey (PH); Jory Long (So., SET).Outlook: The Lions weren't only the Bayside's winningest team a year ago - going 17-1 - but were also perhaps the toughest mentally. Queen Anne's rallied from a 2-0 hole to defeat Kent Island in the regular-season finale, then came back from a 2-1 deficit to beat the Bucs for its secomd straight regional title.This year's goal?\"They want to take it to the end,\" said Brice, whose team's unbeaten run ended in last year's state quarterfinals.\"They want to go to states; the championship.\" The talent and motivation certainly looks to be in place.Taylor, Pinder and Titus, all first-team North Bayside selections a year ago, are back, as are Pinder and Huber. Then there are the new faces.\"The fillers are coming in now from all the travel clubs,\" Brice said. \"It's nice to see a few girls who have been touching a volleyball for a few years.\" The Lions will continue their one-match-ata-time approach, then push for another North and division title before bidding to become the first Bayside school to win a state volleyball championship since North Caroline won the 1A title in 1990.\"They're the most motivated group of kids that I've ever coached,\" Brice said.\"Self motivated. They want to do well for each other.And that makes a big difference on the volleyball court and even our practices.\"I think they have it all,\" Brice continued. \"We still start at the basics, our foundations, and we really focus on our mental game. I know they have the skill. We've seen it throughout the year.But I think the biggest part, especially with volleyball, is that mental game.\"GUNSTONHead Coach: David Henry.Who's Where: Jessica Hammond (Sr., LIB); Phoebe Kelly (Jr., OH); Emma Nkanza (So., SET/RSH); Scotia Hopper (Fr., SET); Mia Walker (Jr., MH); Liv Labrador (Fr., OH); Kate Andrews (So., MH); Olivia Arthur (Jr., RSH); Chloe Bennett (Fr., LIB/RSH).Outlook: The Herons have already matched last year's win total with Wednesday's 3-0 sweep of Key School, and Henry starts his second year thinking the potential is there for more.\"Tight-knit group, lots of potential,\" said Henry, who will be assisted by Jill Labrador.\"I think they'll be a good team if they're hitting on all cylinders.\" Gunston competes in the four-team Eastern Shore Independent Athletic Conference, which also includes Saints Peter and Paul, Salisbury Christian and Worcester Prep.Editor's Note: Information on Kent County and Saints Peter and Paul was unavailable at presstime. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY WILLIAM HAUFE\n \nBaillie Pinder (8) and defending Bayside Conference and 2A East Region II champion Queen Anne's County are looking for a deeper postseason run this year.\n \nPHOTO BY WILLIAM HAUFE\n \nLilli Dauses (21) and Kent Island have the potential to again battle Queen Anne's County for North Bayside supremacy this year. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He pointed out that — contrary to the popular narrative of low test scores reflecting badly on CCPS — \"these kids were ridiculously good readers and the teachers are rockstars.\"\nHayhurst said that he sees a lot of the same kids at his Superdojo, so he enjoyed being able to connect with them both in a space outside of martial arts. At Superdojo, he focuses on taking abstract ideas like how to create a positive environment and making them relevant in his teaching of martial arts, which he brought into facilitating the gym class with a fun twist on a jump rope activity.\nHayhurst also brought dry erase markers to replace the dried up ones for a teacher, and created \"reading buddies\" — pom poms with googly eyes — to make reading activities more fun for the kids. His efforts to bring in new elements made a positive impact on the students and the faculty.\n\"Go into the classroom and believe that you're a leader and you can make a difference with the kids just by being a positive role model,\" Hayhurst said.\nHe was impressed with the students' math abilities. He joined in on a multiplication table competition doing as many problems as quickly as possible, thinking he would win. But to his surprise, \"I look up and there's a girl that had been finished for like 10 seconds just looking at me like, 'What took you so long,'\" Hayhurst said.\nHayhurst valued the opportunity to connect with students and teachers and encouraged others to do the same.\n\"That connection is really important, and we've lost it in our community. We don't even know who our neighbors are, but we can find our neighbors in our local schools, and everybody, I think, should be a part of the schools,\" Hayhurst said.\nDarius Humphries with Chesapeake Care Resources said he enjoyed his time at Elkton Middle School where he sat in on a math class where the teacher pushed the students to think critically and strategize. He plans to volunteer more with public schools in the future because of his experience with \"Teacher for a Day.\"\nSchool officials said that situations such as these were the goal of the entire experience.\n\"We really just wanted our community to see what goes on, the amazing things that go on in our school every day and see what the kids are learning,\" Isaac said.\nNick LaBrant with Utilitrain had the opportunity to teach a Cherry Hill Middle School social studies class about the history of power lines. With an informative presentation and power line props, LaBrant immersed himself as a teacher.\n\"It was actually an incredible class,\" LaBrant said. \"I was able to give the students a little bit of an industry insight on something that really matters in the class.\"\nThe students had just learned about the history of railroads, so LaBrant's presentation fit right into the curriculum. LaBrant also educated students about soft skills necessary for the work force.\n\"I know that they're still in middle school, but I got to talk to them about teamwork and accountability and integrity from someone who's been out in the industry,\" LaBrant said.\nLaBrant added that he was impressed with the students' engagement with his lesson.\n\"For every student to be paying attention, have questions, remaining engaged, I think it says a lot of good things about our public school system here in Cecil County,\" LaBrant said.\nAs a parent himself, this initiative reminded LaBrant to get more involved in Cecil County schools, while seeing how much patience and gratitude the teachers have toward their students to be successful.\n\"We would welcome an opportunity to have another 'Teacher for a Day' next year and hope that people continue to take advantage of it,\" Isaac said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Traffic concerns derail proposed apartment complex - Board of Zoning Appeals denies Aspire Apartments' special exception request\n\n October 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1093\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - After four and a half hours of testimony and deliberations, the Easton Board of Zoning Appeals denied Aspire Apartments' request for a special exception to use a property off of Mathewstown Road as a multifamily apartment complex.Almost every seat was full in the meeting chambers Tuesday evening as supporters and opponents waited for a chance to weigh in on the contentious proposed complex - and to hear the long-awaited decision on the project's requests.Brought forth by Aspire Outdoors LLC, a company owned by Easton resident Derick Daly, the project proposed a six-building, 162-unit apartment complex with 27 units in each building.The property is situated on the south end of Camac Street, southwest of the existing Hunters Mill neighborhood and adjacent to the Gannon Range, previously known as the Estates at Gannon Farm, planned unit development. It's also located within the R-10A zone, a residential district within the Town of Easton.A multifamily apartment complex within the district requires a special exception granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, which prompted Daly's request.Daly also requested a variance to allow reduction of the rear setback dimension for the apartment buildings and parking area to be reduced from the town zoning code's required 75 feet to 50 feet due to the unusual size and configuration of the area.The project first came before the town planning commission last December, where Hunters Mill residents voiced concerns about traffic and accessibility.The proposal was initially slated to be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals in April, but was delayed by 180 days to address ongoing concerns.Within the last few months, both town planning staff and the planning commission recommended approval of Daly's application with conditions, which included project phasing, addressing traffic mitigation and ensuring adequate wastewater capacity.The proposed phasing suggestion, which was incorporated into plans shown at Tuesday's meeting, indicated that access to the first phase of buildings would be via Camac Street.The second phase of construction would include access to the complex via Gannon Range and Camac Street. An additional entrance for the third phase of development was yet to be determined.To Daly, inspiration for the apartment complex was drawn from the opportunity to provide \"much-needed housing\" to Easton. About 25% of the profits are going to another one of Daly's ventures: Polaris Village Academy, a free private school located in the Port Street area.Daly said the complex was intended to be a higher-end property to serve employees of the new regional medical center, which has yet to begin construction.Board of Zoning Appeals member Gary Molchan questioned why Aspire Apartments couldn't have its own entrance like other complexes instead of running through residential neighborhoods. Daly said he was limited by wetlands, which would require a different set of approvals.Questions were also raised about the number of parking spaces for the entirety of the complex, the possibility of parking spilling over onto Camac Street and adequate public facilities.A significant portion of the meeting was spent discussing traffic - a primary concern of Hunters Mill residents.Betty Tustin, a senior project manager for The Traffic Group, said once fully developed, the apartment complex would generate 875 average daily trips. The number was one she deemed as sufficient for what was permitted under town standards.But to Troy Brestel, a professional engineer and project manager with Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. who testified on behalf of the project's opponents, said that he agreed with the number of average daily trips listed in the developer's traffic study, but disagreed with amount of average daily trips on Camac Street once the apartments were developed.John Franczak, the vice president of the Hunters Mill Homeowners' Association, led opposition to the apartment complex on behalf of the neighborhood.\"We feel that the town comprehensive plan should be followed, no variances or exceptions,\" he said. \"The rules are there to protect people.\"The Town of Easton is also installing a long-promised park in the neighborhood, which means more young children and families out walking - a dangerous situation if there's heavy traffic flow from an apartment complex, Franczak said.Several members of the public took the opportunity to comment at the end of each side's presentation.The board's discussion on the variance request was brief, with members acknowledging its minimal impact - the property's use was more important. Approval of the variance request was unanimous.More detailed deliberations ensued on the special exception request.Molchan voiced concerns about the change in character of the surrounding area and traffic congestion.\"I would support that the Town of Easton needs apartments like this, but these apartments should not affect a community that already exists,\" he said. \"What we're doing to the people on Camac we're turning a quiet residential neighborhood into a bustling thoroughfare for cars and delivery trucks and contractor vehicles, and that's after the apartments are built, that's not while they're being built. Who knows what that will be?\"Board member Zakary Krebeck raised similar points, speaking about the \"unrealistic\" provision of parking spaces and the impact it would have on Hunters Mill.To board chairman Peter Cotter, traffic and congestion were the two main issues he was grappling with.\"I don't see how it's currently configured, how I can get to a yes using Camac Street,\" he said, \"because I just think that regardless of how the plan is, that's going to be what is used.\"A motion to deny the special exception was promptly voted on, earning a unanimous consensus.In a phone interview Wednesday afternoon, Daly said he was \"disheartened\" by the special exception's denial, but understood why the board chose to do so. Looking forward, he plans to make adjustments to his proposal and come before the board again.Because the board denied the application, Daly must wait a full year before returning with the same proposal, per the town's zoning ordinance.

You pay a small fortune to get it and keep it.Then, if you have the blatant audacity to actually file a claim, the company either increases your premiums or cancels you altogether.OK, that may be a bit extreme, but you get my point.While the world of insurance can at times be so confusing as to be maddening, going without basic automobile coverage is simply not an option. The financial risk is just too great. But there are some things you can do to make sure you don't stand out to the company as an intolerable risk.You should file an auto insurance claim if: There are injuries, even minor ones. It's crucial to report the incident to your insurer to ensure your coverage applies, preventing unexpected bills and safeguarding you from potential lawsuits by injured drivers.Another driver is involved.Contact your insurance company whenever you're in a crash with another driver, especially when fault isn't clear. Reporting the incident to your insurer helps make sure the blame is assigned fairly and shields you from excessive liability.There is damage to vehicles or property. Insurance is there to help you with costs when things get damaged, so you don't have to pay a big lump sum. That's why you pay monthly premiums.You shouldn't file an auto insurance claim if: You are the only person involved. If the incident is your fault and does not involve injuries, not telling your insurance company will help protect your premium.There is only a small amount of damage. Even if you have collision coverage in your car insurance, you might decide not to file a claim if your car has only minor damage.Mary invites you to visit her at EverydayCheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.Mary invites questions and comments at https://www.everydaycheapskate.com/contact/, \"Ask Mary.\" CO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bucs, Sabres set sights on titles\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1389\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The postseason is a long ways off, but Saints Peter and Paul High's boys lacrosse team has already faced its toughest competition this season.The Sabres' first five games of the regular season featured Calvert Hall, which is ranked No. 2 nationally in the latest USA Lacrosse Magazine poll, and No. 1 in the state. Sts. Peter & Paul also has had games against three other top-20 ranked teams in Maryland — No. 5 Bullis Prep; No 16. Good Counsel; and No. 19 Severn.\n\"It's everything I wanted,\" Sabres head coach Todd Wolters said of the opening gauntlet. \"I'm very happy with what we have.\"\nThough Sts. Peter & Paul lost its first five games before routing James M. Bennett 17-1 last week, Wolters said he's not concerned with his personal record, but is focused on preparing his team for another run at a Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference title after falling shy in last year's championship game.\nThough Kent Island has yet to begin its regular season, head coach Bobby Woolley has also been impressed with what he's seen from his team during a tough preseason slate that included dates with No. 18 DeMatha, No. 22 Broadneck and No. 23 South River before Monday's final exhibition against Springside Chestnut Hill Academy of Philadelphia.\n\"We put our necks out there right away and just started learning about ourselves,\" said Woolley, whose preseason also included Sherwood, Fallston, Cape Henlopen and Archmere Academy. \"I feel like we got a lot of what it takes.\"\nEaston will look to send longtime head coach Dennis Keenan off as a winner. The Warriors graduated the majority of their firepower from a year ago, but look to have the goods for another solid season, along with Queen Anne's and North Caroline.\nWhile Keenan begins his farewell tour, two Mid-Shore teams welcome new head coaches, with Ben Joiner taking over at Kent County, and Teddy Peyton at Gunston. There is also a new kid on the block, with North Dorchester beginning its first year of varsity play under the direction of veteran head coach Steve Hurley.\n\"We don't have much experience so we're going to learn a lot of game this year and next year,\" said Hurley, who has 18 out for the team. \"We're having fun; kids are learning.\"\nHere's a look at this year's teams.\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Brendan Bromwell.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Andrew McMichael (Sr.); Defense: Christian Dockins (Sr.); Jeffrey Sellman (So.); Juan Slaughter (So.); Midfield: Gavin Weber (So.); Tabrion Watts (Sr.); Kimir Lake (Sr.); Attack: Charles Spedden (Jr.); Gibby Robinson (So.); Nate McClaren (Sr.).\nOutlook: The Vikings are fast and athletic defensively, led by four-year man Dockins. Bromwell applauded McMichael, who has stepped in at goalie.\n\"I'm proud of him,\" Bromwell said. \"We didn't have anybody and Andrew came to me and said, 'Hey, I know we're kind of struggling in this spot, I'll give it a try.' And he's done good.\"\nThere is also athleticism at the midfield with Watts and Lake. Bromwell likes Weber's old-school style of play and will have him facing off.\nSpedden, whose growth in the game is \"insane\", according to Bromwell, quarterbacks the attack.\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Dennis Keenan.\nWho's Where: Goalies: Mason Quicke (So.); Randall Mills (Sr.); Defense: Eddie Whelan (Sr.); Ethan Finlay (Sr.); Max Smith (So.); Nathan Lapp (Sr.); Ethan Ballance (Jr.); Darren Foxwell (Sr.); Midfield: Spencer Gunshenan (So.); Conner Hensley (Sr.); Logan Friend (Jr.); Cole Murphy (So.); Finn Gunshenan (Sr.); Landon Chaney (Sr.); Blake Royer (So.); Colin Keenan (Sr.); Luke Stanco (Jr.); Grayson Buritsch (Jr.); Miles Chaney (So.); Blake Newton (Jr.); Attack: Campbell Taliaferro (Sr.); Jackson Wieland (Jr.); David Rogers (Jr.); Trace Haddaway (So.); Miles Abell (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Warriors lost the bulk of their scoring with the graduation Drew Schmidt (54 points) and Hudson Royer (43 points), who are both at Lynchburg (Va.), and Tyler Rardin (50 points).\nWhile there looks to be plenty of offensive options, Keenan said defense is the team's strength, and was impressed with Quicke's 12-save effort against North Caroline in Friday's opener.\n\"We're building,\" Keenan said. \"They listen. They're willing to be taught.\"\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Bobby Woolley.\nWho's Where: Goalies: Quinn Burns (Fr.); Chris Lemme (Sr.); Cody Jones (Sr.); Defense: Gavan Henry (Sr.); Ryan Austin (Sr.); Robert Hottel (So.); Eric Hofmann (Sr.); Grayson Corn (So.); Connor Byrne (Jr.); Finn McGrath (So.); Midfield: Keegan Green (Sr.); Connor Gardner (So.); Marshall Dandy (Jr.); Aidan Henry (Sr.); Attack: Mark Rees (Sr.); Brian Rees (Jr.); Colton Schneck (Sr.); Liam Dermer (Sr.); Face-off: Ricky Verger (Sr.); Roy Scott (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Bucs' bid last year for a third consecutive Class 2A state title was foiled in the semifinals by eventual state champ Glenelg. All-North Bayside Offensive Player of the Year Tucker Claxton graduated along with fellow first-team all-North picks Owen Wynot and Micah Quinn.\nBut Woolley thinks this squad is in a more stable place heading into this season compared to last year, when he and his staff seemed to be forever patching holes. A strong returning cast, including all-North first-teamers Gavan Henry and Green, St. Mary's transfers Hottel and Dandy, and promising freshman class figure to have the Bucs challenging for a 10th Bayside Conference title in 13 years.\nBut nobody has thrilled Woolley more than the return of Hofmann, who missed all last season with an injury.\n\"Having Eric back is a game-changer, as far as controlling the field between the restraining lines and putting pressure on people to get the ball into their offensive zone,\" Woolley said.\nThere's been a three-way battle for starting goalie between Lemme, Jones and freshman Burns, who has really turned heads.\n\"All in all, I feel like we're more of a complete team heading into this year than we were last year,\" Woolley said. \"We're positioned with high expectations and talent to back it.\"\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: Gavin Houseman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Koen Jackson (Sr.); Defense: Derek Jones (Sr.); Gabe Holt (So.); Sam Heimbuch (Fr.); Midfield: Jimmy Cohoon (Jr.); Owen Walstrum (Jr.); Dylan Robinson (Jr.); Charlie Fleshman; Attack: Jake Hoofnagle (Fr.); Mason Ratcliff (Jr.); Corey Bunce (Sr.)\nOutlook: The Bulldogs finished .500 in the regular season a year ago, and after a solid outing in Friday's opener against Easton, Houseman thinks there's potential to improve.\n\"We thought we'd have to take a step back with having younger guys taking more of a senior role but we really haven't had to,\" Houseman said. \"We've picked up pretty much where we left off last year. We played pretty strong against Easton. We had minor hiccups, which I think are easy to fix.\"\nQUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY\nHead Coach: Brad Niesz.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Brian Maleski (Jr.); Defense: Brett Bast (Sr.); Ethan Hahn (Sr.); James Rath (Jr.); Conner Cheezum (Sr.); Ryan Lee (Sr.); Brian Patrick; Midfield: Tanner Lyon (Sr.); Conlan Nagle (Sr.); Carter Hercher (So.); Casey Ryan (Jr.); Midfield-Attack: Tyler Crist (Jr.); Charlie Schmidt (Jr.); Jackson Shiley (Jr.); Sam Yetman (Jr.); Attack: Jamison Kendall (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Lions graduated a lot of experience, particularly on the defensive end. Gone is first-team all-North Bayside goalie Dino Blue. Niesz said the loss of defenseman Hunter Kelly will also hurt, but the return of Lee, a first-team choice a year ago, should anchor the defense.\n\"We've had to move around a number of players,\" Niesz said. \"We are a relatively small program in terms of numbers so we're going to ask guys to fill multiple roles.\"\nSAINTS PETER & PAUL\nHead Coach: Todd Wolters.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Hank Wolters (Jr.); Defense: Porter Bishop (Jr.); Daniel Schwaninger (Jr.); Jackson Jancosko (Fr.); Langdon Anderson (Jr.); Cole Philip (Fr.); Drake Stolba (Jr.); Midfield: Grant Messick (Jr.); Lane Williams (Sr.); Mason Roland (Fr.); Jamir Demby (Fr.); Eddie Albright (Fr.); Attack: JJ Rardin (Jr.); Noah Zimmerman (Sr.); Andrew Steinhardt (So.); Liam Durnbaugh (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Sabres lost in last year's MIAA B Conference final to Archbishop Curley, but may be stronger this season.\nThe defense could be among the conference's best with Hank Wolters back in goal, fronted by Bishop, who Coach Wolters has called one of the best in the country, Schwaninger, Jancosko and Anderson.\nThe offense also appears loaded with the return of Rardin, Zimmerman, Steinhardt and Durmbaugh. The biggest concern — other than staying healthy — may be between the restraining lines where the midfield struggled through the first five games.\n\"We're nowhere near full strength,\" Todd Wolters said. \"But they've seen what good teams are like. I'm here to win a B Conference championship and these are the games that will help us.\"\nEditor's Note: Information on Gunston and Kent County was unavailable at press time. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was the fifth commissioner or acting commissioner in a period of seven months.\nYou have to wonder why the president would have chosen Billy Long to serve as the IRS commissioner in the first place.\nHe was a congressman from Missouri from 2011 to 2023. His background was as an auctioneer and real estate agent. According to news sources, the only tax credentials he had ever received were a designation as a \"certified tax and business adviser,\" a title given after taking a short class from a business in Florida.\nAfter getting his certificate, he was involved with companies that assisted businesses and nonprofits in applying for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit available in 2020 and 2021 for employers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom my own experience as both a tax preparer and taxpayer, I have found the civil servants who work for the IRS are some of the smartest and most competent in the federal government. It makes me wonder how these tax professionals kept up their morale with Mr. Long as the commissioner.\nAdd to that the effects of the DOGE project on IRS employees. Since January of this year, thousands have left the agency.\nMore than 266 million tax returns were filed with the IRS in fiscal year 2024, collecting more than $5 trillion in tax revenue and $98 billion in enforcement revenue.\nGiven the enormous, looming debt we are facing, tax revenue is crucial to keep the government functioning and to pay the interest due on this debt.\nI feel fortunate to live in a country where, at least until now, I can file my tax returns and feel confident that they will be processed by an agency that abides by the rules, keeps my records confidential, sends me refunds or credits my payments in an orderly and efficient manner.\nStability and consistency in tax administration are also necessary for a thriving American business community.\nThe IRS deserves good leadership in order to maintain public trust. A healthy U.S. financial system depends on a well-functioning Internal Revenue Service.\nELAINE TAMA\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) introduced a bill on the first day of the General Assembly that would create something that Maryland has never had before — a state fruit.Native to Maryland, persimmons can be found just about everywhere in the state, with the exception of Garrett County due to the mountainous nature of the region.\nIn May and June, persimmon trees flower, but the fruit isn't ready until the fall, leading to many seasonal recipes and drinks. Persimmons have especially been used for fine wines, jams and baked goods.\nThe trees are known for their resilience, being able to thrive for years when they are below the canopy of a forest.\nPrices for persimmons have gone up significantly in recent years, reaching about $6 per pound, and many have not heard how easy it may be to source their own, according to Ellis.\n\"I have persimmon trees in my yard,\" Ellis said. \"They grow naturally, and they're beautiful and delicious.\"\nEllis introduced the legislation to raise awareness for the fruit, as many Marylanders do not realize it is a part of their state and its history.\nIndigenous people of the region used the fruit not only for food but medicinally as well. Sore throats and indigestion were common ailments that the use of persimmons attempted to treat.\nThroughout the Civil War, persimmon seeds were used as a coffee substitute when trade routes were impacted.\nThe usefulness of the persimmon tree doesn't end with the fruit. The wood of the tree is extremely strong, and is commonly used within shoes, golf clubs, flooring and musical instruments.\nIf Senate Bill 74 makes it through both state legislative houses and is signed by the governor, it would become effective Oct. 1.\nTwitter: @MattSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — John North was more than just a well-respected judge.The former Talbot County state's attorney and judge of the District and Circuit courts wore many hats during his professional and retired life, serving as a protector of the Chesapeake Bay, log canoe racing aficionado and vintage automobile enthusiast.\nIn recent days, family, friends and the Talbot County community have remembered North for his roles in all of those capacities and more.\nNorth died in St. Michaels on Sept. 19. He was 94.\nOldest son David North remembered his father as \"competitive with compassion.\" He was supportive and thorough in everything he did, his son said.\n\"Right through the end, he was showing us how to have fun under not very good circumstances and how to stay competitive,\" David North said. \"And how to laugh.\"\nNorth was Talbot County state's attorney from 1962 to 1971. He then served as judge for 12 years in District Court and five years in Circuit Court before his appointment as the first chairman of the Maryland Critical Area Commission, the state agency responsible for protecting the health of the Chesapeake Bay and enforcing laws at a local level.\nPete Lesher, current Talbot County Council vice president, reflected on North's impact with the commission and as one of the founders of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in the 1960s.\n\"He lived and played on Chesapeake waters,\" said Lesher, also the museum's chief historian. \"He valued the health of these waters and I think relished that role of caring for them in the capacity of the Critical Area regulation.\"\nRen Serey, former executive director of the Critical Area Commission, worked closely with North for many years. \"The Judge,\" as North was widely known, brought the necessary judicial expertise and temperament to chair the commission, Serey said.\nNorth was responsible for implementing local critical area programs at a time when the Bay's environmental needs clashed with rural growth and development patterns, Serey said. But North struck the perfect balance in adjudicating such matters.\n\"Having Judge North up there at the head of the table facing 29 people who were debating these issues was just the perfect role for him,\" Serey said. \" ... He knew how to listen, he knew how to interject, he knew how to keep the discussion without certain boundaries.\"\nThose that worked closely with North said he was widely trusted for his fairness and loyalty.\nLesher recalled a time in the early 2000s when the state committed funds for repairs to the Chesapeake Bay's skipjack fleet. But the state didn't fully lay out how the money would be doled out among skipjack captains in Tilghman Island and Deal Island.\nJudge North, though, stepped in.\n\"Who was going to be the trusted arbiter if it came down to a Deal Island versus Tilghman Island? It was Judge North,\" Lesher said. \"He was trusted by these watermen.\"\nNorth's wife of 64 years, Ethel Towers North, died in 2019. He is survived by sons David and Daniel and their wives Joan Hoge-North and Margaret Enloe-North, along with grandchildren Drew North, Dylan North, Campbell North, William Spencer North and Nathaniel Vivian, and former daughters-in-law, Sallie North and Carrington North. He is also survived by Comber McHugh, a companion of later years.\nIn addition to his esteemed roles with the courts and the Critical Area Commission, North was a local log canoe captain. He wrote a book on sailing log canoes, which was published by the Maritime Museum in 2018.\n\"The Judge\" skippered Island Bird, the 27-foot-4-inch log canoe built by North's great-grandfather in 1882.\nDavid North said his younger brother Daniel took up his dad's sailing hobby. They both have kids who continue sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"It's a piece of our family. It's a piece of our heritage,\" David North said.\nIn his spare time, \"The Judge\" was a lover of feral cats, a keen reader and a sculptor. Some of his sculpting works are displayed at The Trippe Gallery in Easton.\nDavid North said he followed his dad's footsteps in the world of automobile restoration and car shows. Judge North especially loved Bugattis and Duesenbergs.\nNorth was a founder of the St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance, an annual car showcase nearing its 20-year mark. Luke Phipps, the festival's current chair, said it began as simply an oyster roast at North's house in St. Michaels, where friends of \"The Judge\" would bring their vintage cars to his front lawn. Then, the tradition grew into a solidified event.\nThe 18th St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance was hosted Sept. 26-28 at the Kent Island Yacht Club. Despite heavy rain the night before the festival's last hurrah on Sept. 28, Phipps said it was a \"beautiful\" and sunny Sunday.\nPhipps said all he could think of was North — a close friend and valuable mentor — smiling down on Sunday.\nHe recalled North as a \"sharp\" and an \"eloquently spoken\" man.\n\"There'll never be another one like him,\" Phipps said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They also describe their own role within the organization along with the day-to-day functions,\" Carter said.\nIt is advantageous to students because employers know real-world demands and can outline the educational requirements to work in that field.\nParticipating businesses this year included Chesapeake CNC, DMS & Associates, Eastman Specialty Corp., Modern Stone Age Food Lab, Sunrise Solar, University of Maryland Shore Medical Center, Washington College GIP Program and the University of Maryland Extension, which partnered with Red Acres Hydroponics to demonstrate the wide range of advances in agricultural technologies.\nCarter said the Kent County STEM students, their parents and teachers greatly appreciate the businesses and professionals who share their time and resources to make the program a success.\n\"The program is a timely resource for students as they look into secondary education and any specialized studies they will need in order to qualify for the careers they desire,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This change will help the plan meet requirements from the Talbot County Health Department.Ryan Showalter, Lakeside's attorney, said new representatives of the Health Department had waited to provide comments on the preliminary and final plans for Lakeside until they receive approval from the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nMDE requested two changes to the final plan. The first relates to the Health Department's signature approval block. The approval block before referenced the parcels that are associated with the treatment plan. According to Showalter it basically said they're approved as lots for development purposes.\nThe second change pertains to the lots for the spray irrigation field. According to Showalter, there were three lots for the spray field, which was everything north of the treatment plant, the storage lagoon and the reserve spray field was a lot.\nMDE is requesting all the lots to be on a single parcel, essentially erasing boundary lines on the plan.\n\"And so that's the only change, is to remove those internal division lines so that what was three lots is now Lot C.\"\nAccording to Robert Rauch, this change in no way alters the boundaries or acreage of the parcels.\n\"We had three parcels associated with the spray field they wanted to incorporate into a single parcel,\" he said. \"Didn't change any of the boundaries. Didn't change every acreage, but we had to switch them to a single parcel instead of three separate ones.\"\nThe planning commission unanimously approved a motion to authorize Commission President Edgar to sign the revised plats when they are approved by the Health Department and MDE.\nRauch shared with the commission that the wastewater treatment plant is now meeting effluent requirements and the Health Department and MDE approved that the treatment plant can start discharging to the lagoon starting last week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The band and chorus are comprised of instrumentalists and singers from across the United States. With their music, they are the American musical ambassadors to France.\nAn invitation to sing in the All-American Community Chorus was sent to a local group, the Queen Anne's Chorale in Centreville. In addition to this honor, their Artistic Director, Robert Huntington, was chosen to conduct the chorus. Fourteen singers, along with family and friends, participated in this memorable trip.\nBefore leaving, however, they met several times to practice so they were ready to rehearse with the other singers upon arrival in Paris. The concert repertoire with an \"Americana\" theme included \"Down to the River to Pray,\" \"The Yellow Rose of Texas,\" \"Swinging on a Star\" and \"Let There Be Peace on Earth.\"\nTheir itinerary for the nine-day trip began with a special guided tour, stopping at several significant areas dedicated to the D-Day battles of Normandy Campaign. Both the Chorus and Band joined forces for a Wreath Laying Ceremony at the Utah Beach Memorial. The Choir traveled to the American Cemetery at Omaha Beach and were able to tour the solemn place of honor. The Chorus presented concerts in the town square and in the Church in Sainte-Mere-Eglise as part of the Musical Salute to Liberation. They also participated in the annual D-Day Memorial Parade held there.\nBefore returning home, the Chorus also had an opportunity to explore Paris and perform an afternoon concert at La Madeleine Cathedral.\nAs Chorale singers began planning their trip to France, they found that their town of Centreville had yet another connection to D-Day, 1944. Sadly, one of its young men, U.S Army Private First-Class William H. Quillen, fought with the 29th Infantry Division and lost his life on the sixteenth of June 1944 during an ensuing battle. He received the Purple Heart and is buried in the Normandy American Cemetery.\nUpon learning about Private Quillen, the Chorale, with the assistance of the Queen Anne's County Library in Stevensville, researched and identified his grave site coordinates. On June 5, Chorale members placed a flag on his grave in Normandy honoring his courage and sacrifice for the United States and the Allied Forces. A picture was taken with Chorale singers holding flags from both Queen Anne's County and the town of Centreville. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Encounter with Jimmy Carter provides memories\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LINDA EVANS | Section: Columns \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Editor's note: This column originally appeared in the Star Democrat on Oct. 17, 2021. It is repeated here after Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday this week.It was the mid-seventies and I was a young Washington, D.C., Republican staffer with the rare opportunity to work as a personal assistant for the Honorable and Mrs. George Romney (Mitt Romney's parents).\nPretty exciting for a farm girl from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. When the Romneys invited me out to formal occasions, as a member of their staff, I was occasionally mistaken for Mitt's sister, Lynn.\nIt was cherry blossom time, and a longtime friend who drove me to the Tidal Basin that day happened to be an employee of the Secret Service. As we walked around the Tidal Basin, a long, black limousine pulled up and my friend yelled, \"It's the president.\"\nI nonchalantly responded, \"The President of what? What company?\"\nHe repeated, \"It's President Carter! It's Carter!\nAs a government employee, he knew to position us near where the president's car door would open, with the idea of taking a photograph of the president, if possible. When President Carter emerged from the limousine, I was indeed one of the first in line, and even though I was a staunch Romney Republican, I did what any American would do, outstretched my hand and shook the hand of the president of the United States. Many would be lost for words at that point, but I somehow found the presence of mind to say sincerely, \"Thank you for being our president.\"\nPresident Carter, apparently touched by my sincerity, thanked me. My friend had his old Polaroid camera with him and asked the president if he would mind posing for a photo. The president quickly agreed, and then said to no one in particular: \"Isn't she beautiful?\"\nWhat a compliment for me. I smiled for my friend's camera and that was the end of the exchange; my friend and I were off to tour the cherry blossoms with hundreds, possibly thousands of others that evening.\nThe Polaroids turned out so-so, but my friend, being politically minded, said he had seen White House photographers there. In fact, since I had my new black velour jacket over my arm, he said he felt the Secret Servicemen were carefully watching me for the president's safety.\n\"Why don't you call the White House and see if any of them got you on film?\" he suggested. What an outlandish thought, but tempting. The next day, I looked up the White House switchboard number and hesitantly dialed 212-456-1414, and asked for the White House press secretary, as I had been instructed by my friend.\n\"Hello, this is Karl Schumaker,\" the voice on the phone answered with a German accent. Since I am also of German descent, we had something in common. I said, \"Sir, you won't believe it, but the president of the United States told me I was beautiful yesterday at the Tidal Basin. \"\nPause.\n\"What were you wearing?\" he asked.\n\"I was wearing a pink jumpsuit and pink scarf.\"\n\"You are beautiful,\" Karl said. \"I have three photographs of you. Would you like me to mail them to you or would you like to come to the White House and pick them up this week?\"\nI chose the date of Thursday that week because my sister would be in town, and we not only got autographed photos that day, but a tour of the Oval Office and presidential memorabilia. I showed the photos to our parents and then I filed them in my big, old file cabinet, with only one of the photos on my office wall, seen by almost no one. I'm still a Romney Republican and always will be, but also a Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter fan.\nAnd a fan of someone else in the White House, the Press Secretary Karl Schumaker, who would teach the importance of customer service and taking extra time out to make memories that have lasted over 40 years. It was President Carter's birthday on Oct. 1 (he turned 100), and he received the Nobel Peace Prize also on Oct. 11 (in 2002), which reminded me of this occasion.\n\"To this day, Jimmy Carter looks back on a life of faith and service, and ahead to a more peaceful world,\" Mark K. Updegrove wrote in an article titled \"Building a Better World,\" found in in Parade Magazine, Feb. 18, 2018. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton considers ordinance to crack down on seafood processing odors\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 811\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Amid resident concerns, the Easton Town Council is considering an ordinance to adjust zoning and place restrictions on seafood processors.The legislation, sent to the council for review following approval from the Planning Commission, was created in response to odor complaints from residents living near the business Chesapeake Brand Seafood on Maryland Avenue.\nAt Monday's Town Council meeting, councilmembers heard mixed reviews on the ordinance from residents and business owners, opting to leave the public hearing open and explore options such as moving the business out of a residential area.\nUnder the ordinance's proposed definition, seafood processing would be defined as \"harvested seafood\" being \"cleaned, cut, eviscerated or otherwise prepared or cooked for sale in bulk, with a resulting by-product.\"\nIf approved, seafood processing would remain permitted in the industrial zoning district but only allowed in business commercial through a special exception. That exception would require that by-products are \"stored within a closed or refrigerated vehicle,\" with operators required to install \"odor control technology\" so \"no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building.\"\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis, who said he's heard the complaints from many of his constituents, took issue with the fact that the proposed ordinance requires existing businesses to comply by Jan. 1, 2026 instead of sooner.\n\"I don't think it's fair for the individuals who live in that area to have to go through another summer dealing with the odor,\" Davis said. \"It's unfair. So I'm going to advocate that it be six months.\"\nDavis added he doesn't think seafood processing should be allowed in business commercial zoning at all. Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello agreed with Davis' perspective but asked that the council consider the legislation's potential impacts on other seafood businesses.\n\"My only concern would be that we have several other seafood facilities in town who don't have these issues,\" Abbatiello said. \"And I would hate to see them get caught up in a similar scenario, where they're getting, for lack of a better term, punished.\"\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus asked if the town had a plan to aid smaller seafood businesses if they're forced to comply with the costly odor mitigation requirements.\n\"If we're going to be potentially imposing regulations on businesses that have significant financial impact to the point which some have claimed would put them out of business, I think we should take pause with that,\" Gunsallus said.\n\"I'm not quite concerned about that, personally,\" Davis responded. \"I'm more concerned about the constituents in the neighborhood. … What you're just saying (makes) it seem like it's a hardship on the business when they probably haven't even tried.\"\nZach Smith, attorney for Chesapeake Brand Seafood owner/operator Mitchell Hughes, provided a letter to the council to be read aloud during the public hearing on the ordinance.\nIf passed, the ordinance \"will put Mitchell out of business and will cause significant economic harm to him, his families, his employees and the local watermen that he supports,\" Smith wrote.\nThe attorney said Hughes has taken \"reasonable steps\" to mitigate the impact on residents as they have brought up concerns. However, he says buying new equipment isn't doable.\n\"While Mitchell has tried to be a good neighbor, he cannot reasonably install equipment that prohibits any smell from being detected outside of his building,\" Smith wrote. \"Mitchell has looked into what will be necessary to satisfy this proposed regulation, and such technology is not feasible and will be extremely cost prohibitive.\"\nRESIDENT CONCERNSDuring the public hearing, many residents voiced impacts Hughes' business has had on their quality of life. Resident Philip Bernot said he's lived next to grain processors, metal fabricators and plumbers at the site since 2001, never before experiencing any issue that brought him to a town meeting.\n\"Not a single one of these businesses has ever brought me up here to complain,\" Bernot said. \"Not a single one of these businesses has repeatedly caused a gut-wrenching stench to take over the entire neighborhood.\"\nA representative for Sea Watch International said the business on Glebe Park Drive would be \"swept up into new legislation.\" Bruce Cole, owner of Cole's Seafood House & Deli, echoed this, saying the ordinance would negatively impact his operation on North Washington Street.\n\"(The) impact that he has is going to impact me,\" Cole said, noting equipment may cost around $100,000. \" … I don't have any complaints.\"\nFollowing the public hearing, Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry asked the council to pause on taking action. She emphasized the operation of the business under scrutiny is different from businesses like Cole's.\n\"They're not doing it for retail, they're doing it for wholesale and to push out a product,\" Curry said. The council left the public hearing open for the Nov. 18 meeting.\nCurry added that she hopes the council can work toward a \"best case scenario\" in which Chesapeake Brand Seafood moves out of its current location to a more appropriate one away from residents. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

West took declarer's jack with his queen and exited with a spade, won by South's king.Declarer cashed the diamond king-queen and spade queen before playing a spade to dummy's ace.After taking the 13th spade and the diamond ace, South exited with dummy's last diamond. West won with the nine and cashed the heart ace, but he had to concede the last trick - declarer's ninth - to the heart king.Bridge is a tough game!Receive daily instructive and entertaining quizzes from Phillip by subscribing for only $10 per month at www.bridgeforeveryone.com. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ads falsely claim to be associated with Fresh Cannabis, the licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensary on Ogletown Road.\n\"The impostors are attempting to mislead potential customers into purchasing marijuana products illegally,\" said Jon Peterson, a spokesman for DATE.\nOne of the ads includes a cartoon of a marijuana leaf character holding a joint and targeting UD students with the words \"UDEL-iver? Yes we do!\"\n\"Quick delivery for on-campus students only! (DoorDash/Uber Eats Style!),\" reads the ad, which includes the Fresh Cannabis logo and a promise of a free sample of marijuana for students who sign up.\nAnother ad also includes the Fresh Cannabis logo and shows a menu of offerings. It notes that the business delivers 24/7.\nPeterson emphasized that no licensed marijuana dispensary in Delaware is permitted to deliver marijuana or marijuana products.\n\"Any business claiming to offer delivery services is operating illegally,\" he said. \"Delaware's adult-use marijuana marketplace includes strict regulations and testing standards designed to ensure consumer safety. Products sold through illegal channels bypass these safeguards and may contain dangerous contaminants such as mold, pesticides or heavy metals.\"\nThough Delaware legalized recreational marijuana, it remains illegal to sell it outside of licensed dispensaries.\nTips about this or similar cases can be sent to Cpl. Tristin Burris at tristin.b.burris@delaware.gov.\n\"DATE's Marijuana Enforcement Unit is actively investigating this matter and encourages anyone with information about these fraudulent materials to come forward,\" Peterson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That doesn't mean, as everybody may think, that we're going to react with violence. We're going to react with education.\"\nAccording to a letter signed by Baltimore's Masjid Ad-Da'wah Ilat Tawheed Imam Raha Batts, the videos shows Gibbs \"being verbally and physically attacked with her hijab being violently snatched from her head.\"\nThe letter says that those involved chanted Islamic phrases to \"taunt\" Gibbs. It also says Gibbs was physically assaulted in the presence of the assailant's father.\nGibbs' mom, LaToya Gibbs, said in an interview May 9 that it's been heartbreaking and devastating to see her daughter go through this.\n\"It's been really hard on her mental health and mine,\" she said.\nShe said Tori Gibbs will be doing home hospital schooling through the end of the year due to her mental health.\nCarter said that when he saw the video, he felt outrage.\n\"Everybody should feel safe,\" he said.\nAt the barbecue, organizers grilled hamburgers and hot dogs and offered pamphlets and books about Islam for people to peruse.\nAlong with offering learning opportunities to people in the community, Carter said they came to help foster a peaceful resolution between the children and parents involved in the incident. He said he was able to help make that happen in the early afternoon before the barbecue began.\n\"We're not protesting or anything like that,\" Carter said about the event. \"But we are calling for change. We're calling for education, and we're calling for change.\"\nThe same day as the barbecue, LaToya Gibbs said she and faith leaders sat down with Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson. Although she said the district had given her \"the runaround\" in the past, she said the meeting was a positive one.\n\"Unfortunately it took for my brothers and sisters to make a post and bring more awareness than I could,\" she said about finally getting that meeting.\nLaToya Gibbs said that at the meeting, she talked to Thompson about how better communication with parents could have stopped the situation from getting as bad as it did.\nAccording to a statement from DCPS, Thompson called the meeting constructive and said the Gibbs family's concerns were taken seriously.\n\"The school and community need to work together to prevent small issues becoming big,\" he said about Imam Raha Batts' suggestion to work together on a bullying awareness program. \"It is sensible to use school, where the community's youngsters come together, to further education against bullying. I look forward to working with the Imam on this project.\"\nIn an email, DCPS Communications and Community Outreach Specialist Valerie Goff said that following the meeting, Thompson will be monitoring the situation and checking in with the family.\nIn an interview May 9, Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said that on April 5 the department began investigating the incident, which took place outside a Mace's Lane Middle student's home on March 26. He said police did a detailed investigation that included getting video footage of the incident from social media and from city street cameras.\nTodd said Rian Johnson, a parent of one of the children involved in the incident, has been charged with conspiracy of assault in the second degree, conspiracy of reckless endangerment, reckless endangerment and contributing to the condition of a child. He said one of the children involved was identified as a juvenile offender but has not been charged. He said the Dorchester County State's Attorney is looking into whether the offender's actions could be considered a hate crime.\nLaToya Gibbs said the community barbecue resulted in five attendees taking their Shahada, which means they made the decision to convert to Islam. She said two of those five attendees were the fathers of girls in the video that showed Tori Gibbs being attacked.\nTori Gibbs' great aunt, Kandy Waller, said she just wants her niece to be OK. She said the bullying has been a constant, and she hopes the barbecue results in an end to the bullying and harassment.\n\"I just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood like everybody else without the threat of violence,\" Waller said.\nLaToya Gibbs said the barbecue had a positive effect on her Tori.\n\"She did say she was more confident (seeing) all the people come together and show support for her,\" LaToya Gibbs said.\nThis story has been updated to include comments from DCPS. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Highs are expected to remain in the 90s later in the week across Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties.\nThe Dorchester County Health Department is encouraging people stay out of the sun when temperatures peak in the late mornings and early afternoons.\nA press release from the department noted the following groups should take added precautions: babies, young children, pregnant women, older adults, outside workers and those without air conditioning.\nLocal health officials recommend regularly hydrating, limiting time outdoors and monitoring for signs of heat exhaustion — heavy sweating, cold skin, cramps, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, etc.\nThe Maryland Department of Health said in a press release this week that Maryland saw 26 heat-related deaths last year. The state department added that parents and guardians should never leave children in cars.\n\"Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases — and confirm that they have the resources they need to stay safe during the hottest months,\" said Maryland Secretary of Health Dr. Meena Seshamani in the release.\nEASTON FIRE PREPARES\nAs temperatures heat up, volunteer fire departments across the Mid-Shore remain on call. Due to the physically intensive work of firefighting and the heavy gear that must be worn, some departments are asking for water donations from the community.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson says his department has received enough cases of water from thoughtful community residents and businesses to get through next week's heat wave. Dobson is encouraging residents to contribute to other fire departments in need in Talbot County.\nWhether it's lending bottled waters or assisting with manpower on a call, Dobson says local fire departments work together well.\n\"The other fire chiefs talk a lot, and we're always here to help one another,\" Dobson said.\nThe fire chief noted that as farmers in the area start to cut their wheat, field fires could pop up, a risk fire officials are keeping their eyes on.\nWeather projections are accurate as of Friday afternoon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They learned of town funds being used to purchase personal items, financial errors costing the town to spend money, personnel policies that were not followed, inappropriate purchases and employees engaging in inappropriate discussions in the workplace, the post said.\n\"The Town was reimbursed for the personal and inappropriate purchases and the interim town manager is working to rectify and improve personnel and financial management of the town,\" the town said.\nWhile the internal investigation was completed, District 1 Councilwoman Brandy James said she reported the investigation findings to the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor, where she said the investigation is ongoing.\n\"It was only me who went to the office of the state prosecutor and said, 'Hey, this is what's going on in the town and has been historically happening,' So, they got involved, and they started to investigate like toward the end of February into March. It's to my knowledge they're still investigating,\" James said.\nJames said the fiscal year budget of 2024 brought attention to some of these issues.\n\"So a lot of what's going on is historical misuse of funds, it's historical stuff,\" James said. \"Since I have gotten there, it has always been a rush to pass the budget. There was things in the budget that just did not add up. There was line items to pay somebody to cut grass for a crazy amount of money.\"\nAccording to James, toward the end of November 2024 she received a complaint from a individual about misuse of funds in the town office and the alleged individual wanted the complainant fired.\nJames said she immediately reached out to town leadership and suggested they call a meeting to discuss the allegations further.\n\"Everybody on the dias said, 'Oh, we have holiday plans, we have this.' I was put off again. So we never got around to addressing the allegations until we had a meeting in January,\" she said.\nThrough closed session meetings that followed, the town ultimately decided to let go a member of the town staff, James said.\n\"While we feel it is important that our citizens are aware of the issues the Town faces, we have decided to not release the specific complaints received at this time to avoid the risk of liability for releasing confidential personnel information,\" the Town said in the Facebook statement.\nThe Star Democrat repeatedly tried to reach out to Mayor Kim Abner Tuesday, but she could not be reached for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "James saves U.S. from big upset\n\n July 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: News \n \n 831\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n LeBron James saved the U.S. from what would have been a stunning loss.James' layup with 8 seconds left was the go-ahead basket Saturday, and the U.S. Olympic team that'll soon head to the Paris Games escaped with a 101-100 win over South Sudan in London, rallying from a 16-point deficit to avoid perhaps the biggest upset in the program's history.\nSouth Sudan, the African nation that gained its independence just 13 years ago and is about to play in the Olympics for the first time, led for more than half the game and had a chance to win at the end. But Carlik Jones' runner off the glass missed with about 4 seconds left, and the Americans survived.\n\"I'm going to be honest: I like those better than the blowouts,\" James said as he walked off the court. \"At least we get tested.\"\nOh, they got tested — by a team that came into the game as 43.5-point underdogs , according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\"A good reminder that when we play against teams, it's the biggest game of their lives,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. \"We have to expect everyone to play like that.\"\nDown by 16 at one point, the Americans dug out of that hole with an 18-0 run in the second half — then needed heroics at the end anyway. JT Thor's 3-pointer with 20 seconds left gave South Sudan a 100-99 lead, then the Americans called timeout and put the ball in James' hands.\nHe made it look easy: He waited, waited, waited, then drove and laid it in with ease to put the U.S. back on top, and the Americans got the stop they needed at the end.\nJames finished with a game-high 25 points, six rebounds and seven assists for the U.S., which improved to 4-0 with one game left — Monday vs. World Cup champion Germany — on its pre-Olympic exhibition tour. Anthony Davis added 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Americans.\nMarial Shayok had 24 points for South Sudan and Jones had a triple-double — 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\nThe teams will meet in group play in the Paris Olympics on July 31.\n\"It's basketball. It happens,\" U.S. guard Stephen Curry said. \"You want to play perfect every game; it doesn't happen. But can you dig deep and do the little things that help you win? Offense can come and go, but defense is the thing that helps you win championships, medals, all that stuff.\"\nIt should have been a mismatch, and for the first half, it was — just not in the way anyone would have expected.\nThe U.S. roster has 12 players, all of them All-Stars or NBA champions or both, with a total of 189,038 points in their regular-season careers, with 7,832 combined starts. South Sudan has four players who have appeared in an NBA game. They've scored a combined 1,228 points and started 19 games.\nDidn't matter. It was 8-0 U.S. after 2 1/2 minutes. The rest of the half: South Sudan 58, U.S. 34. The Americans allowed South Sudan to shoot 61% in the first half and got outscored 21-3 from 3-point range in the first 20 minutes.\n\"I did not do a great job preparing our team,\" Kerr said. \"We did not focus enough on what they're capable of, and that's on me. I think that really allowed South Sudan to gain confidence early. ... They were great. They played a wonderful game and the ending was good for us, just to feel that, to feel what it's going to be like in Paris and Lille.\"\nAn 18-0 run in the second half — James involved in most of it — was what really saved the U.S., turning a 76-65 deficit into an 83-76 lead.\nSouth Sudan led by 16 late in the first half — 58-42 — before the Americans got the last basket to cut the deficit to 14 at the break.\nBut the 18-0 run was key. James had four assists during the spurt and Curry, from about 35 feet, connected on a 3-pointer late in the third that gave the U.S. its first lead since the first quarter at 79-76.\nWenyen Gabriel banked in a 3-pointer to get South Sudan within 85-84, but James — his former teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers — connected on a 3 on the ensuing U.S. possession, and the Americans would eventually pull through by the slimmest of margins.\n\"Today we were able to represent our country with pride and we put up a good fight and showed the potential of our country,\" Gabriel said. \"I think it was a proud moment for a lot of people.\"\nDavis said the team got to the arena late, thrown off by standstill London traffic, and that routines going into the game were disrupted. Maybe so, but South Sudan showed the U.S. that nobody at the Olympics will concede anything to the four-time defending gold medalists.\n\"Doesn't matter when it comes to how close the game is,\" James said. \"We went out there to get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Limits on how much a drug should cost",

    "content": "Limits on how much a drug should cost\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 602\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. government last week released the list of the 10 medications that will be the first to be the subject of the new price negotiations under the Medicare reform bill, and my arthritis drug, Enbrel, made the list.To make the cut, you either had to be taken by millions of people, like Eliquis, or cost a fortune. Enbrel costs a fortune.I'm one of 47,000 Medicare recipients lucky enough to receive a drug that my old rheumatologist, who originally prescribed it for me, described as a miracle.When he was a young doctor, he told me, his waiting room of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was full of crippled people. With the advent of \"biologic\" drugs like Enbrel, the crutches and wheelchairs are gone. I count myself very lucky to be mostly symptom-free, which, with RA, is saying a lot. As I say, I'm lucky and blessed. And well-insured.And able to cover the out-ofpocket costs. Which are also substantial.This is the hard part of medical miracles.One month, when I was switching insurance companies, I ran out of Enbrel. I made the mistake of thinking I could actually pay for my weekly shot out-of-pocket if I couldn't get the insurance situation straightened out. \"How much would it be?\" I naively asked the pharmacist. Enbrel is a SureClick pen; it comes in a pack of four. That would be $1,700 for one pen and $7,000 for the pack.Excuse me? Who can afford that?I managed to get a sample from the doctor's office to tide me over and never asked again. Every month when the specialty pharmacy calls me to renew my Medicare prescription, they confirm my $350 co-pay and I don't so much as murmur a word of complaint, because what can I say? The drug saves my life. But I'm lucky I can afford it. That's why Enbrel belongs on the list.Medicines like Enbrel cost billions to develop, and it is only fair that those costs be recouped. But there are limits, and there is no reason that the market should be foreclosed from working freely when it comes to the prices for these prescription drugs. Enbrel costs too much, but there is nothing that I, one consumer, can do about it. We need to stand together, which is to say, we need government to stand up for us and negotiate for us and give voice to our needs.What is stunning about these negotiations is that it took an act of Congress to authorize the government to use the power of the people on behalf of the people to negotiate fair drug prices.The power of the pharmaceutical industry was so great, so much greater than the power of the American people, that it was literally the law of the land that Medicare could not use its bargaining power on behalf of the American taxpayer.When the bill allowing price negotiation passed last year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the program would save Medicare more than $100 billion during the next 10 years.Just stop and consider that for a moment: the biggest purchaser of health services unable to use its bargaining power, on behalf of you and I, leaving the industry's power to set prices unchecked. And yet this is precisely what government is for, precisely what government is meant to do, to stand up for and give voice to we the people. The pharmaceutical industry continues to fight against negotiations in the courts. \"Today is the start of a new deal for patients where Big Pharma doesn't just get a blank check at your expense and the expense of the American people,\" President Joe Biden said in announcing the list.It's about time.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Pride Center brings new world with Dungeons and Dragons\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 824\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In the tavern of a formerly demolished village, a group of brave adventurers is approached by well-dressed, albeit frail-looking, elders who offer a reward of 700 gold to whoever is brave enough to investigate the lizard folks lair in order to gather information on their military weapons.Lauren Fierman, a board member of the Delmarva Pride Center and host of the center's Dungeons and Dragons program, moves around the conference room of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Easton.\nWith every sentence, Fierman provides history, landscape and heart to the world the group of players has carefully developed.\nDelmarva Pride Center hosts an open-for-all Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy tabletop role-playing game, on the fourth Saturday of the month.\nWhat started as a small game event has turned into a growing community, providing a safe environment during a heightened political climate for members of the LGBQT+ community and allies to explore gender identity, sexuality and imagination.\nFierman, who acts as dungeon master (game organizer and participant in charge of creating details and challenges for the game), said the game understands and respects the personal boundaries of its players.\nFrom allowing players to choose the character's pronouns to deciding whether or not they will act out in regional accents, the comfortability of players is key to a successful game.\nIn Fierman's experience, Dungeons and Dragons provided the first space for them to use different pronouns.\n\"I'm playing with gender, (and) I'm playing with sexuality in my characters, and it's just such a wonderful avenue to explore different identities and sexualities,\" Fierman said. \"As a fluid person myself, it was very healthy for me to be in a very safe space with people that I trust to express those parts of me through this game.\"\nAllie Silver, one of the local group's players, said historically Dungeons and Dragons has had a white, straight, male focus. But in recent years, the game has been claimed by LGBTQ+ people who have found the fantasy and community aspect comforting, especially if they feel isolated.\n\"Just creating that space of safety for yourself and for the people at your table is so important because it can become such a beautiful thing,\" Silver said. \"And it's OK if it's not transcendent. If you just play a silly game and kill a bunch of goblins, that's fun.\n\"But just the joy of friendship at the table of community collaboration is what makes this game so good. Especially now more than ever, community is what we need.\"\nThough character building is an important aspect of the game, other players said the game provides an opportunity for them to create LGBTQ+ representation that is frequently left out in the media.\nZack Parreco, a player, said often LGBTQ+ characters' stories use \"queerness\" as something that is othering and aimed at larger audiences to gawk at. In Dungeons and Dragons, LGBTQ+ people can build characters and stories where they can control what is important and what is normal.\n\"There is no pressure for queerness to be a performance for others. It is allowed to just exist,\" Parreco said. \"Maybe we make it big or maybe it's just a normal trait in the world. Either way, we get to fully control our queerness and its expression.\"\nOutside of the game world, players are able to take aspects of their fictional characters into their real lives. Some bring with them new pronouns, and others, like Silver, bring back more courage.\nSilver shared that when she started playing, she was \"an anxious little mouse,\" and, when she was comfortable, she began playing a bold character whose main trait was being able to stand up for everybody.\n\"It was a really fun character, and in the process it gave me permission to find my own courage in my real life and now, in my professional life,\" Silver said. \"I'm an adviser for a Pride group. I volunteer in a bunch of different spaces, and I work to help people and I think that's something eight years ago I would have been terrified to do.\"\nAccording to Fierman, this space is particularly important due to the rise in policies rolling back LGBTQ+ protections since President Donald Trump's inauguration. These policies include executive orders prohibiting gender-affirming health care for those under 19 and designating that the country recognizes only two sexes.\nFierman said now more than ever community and joy needs to be prioritized. This game provides a space to escape from the pressures of the outside and create a physical, mental and emotional space for anyone that needs to get away.\n\"The goal of a lot of these anti-LGBTQ policies and misinformation is to take away our joy. They want us to go away, and I think combating hate with love and combating hate with joy is the most powerful thing you can do because that's what's going to keep us going. That's what kept our community fighting back for generations.\"\nDelmarva Pride Center hosts monthly events including Gender Expression Movement, Elder and Intergeneration Social and Parents and Allies Groups. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton traffic dashboard gives residents detailed look at crash trends\n\n July 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Residents can now easily access traffic statistics online thanks to a new traffic dashboard released by the town last week.The Easton Interactive Traffic Dashboard allows users to view up-to-date vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle data from 2018 to the present.\nIt includes maps, charts and filters that allow users to see crash information based on time of day, where the crash took place and the weather circumstances. Residents can find specific information on categories such as drunk driving, Route 50 and distracted driving incidents.\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey said it will be a valuable resource for the community to better understand where an alarming number of accidents or traffic citations may happen.\n\"We are focusing on making transportation safety in Easton better,\" Lowrey said. \"We're trying to take a methodical approach, a thoughtful approach to it. … Here is a resource, here's a transparent resource to see what is going on in the town where you live.\"\nRon Engle, a former town council member, helped spearhead the project, along with the Washington College Geographic Information Systems Program and the Maryland Highway Safety Office. Engle has a background in law enforcement and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nSean Lynn, the GIS program manager at Washington College, presented the tool to the Easton Town Council on Monday.\n\"Hopefully it allows the folks here in the town to be able to get the information quickly,\" Lynn said.\nEver since the pandemic in 2020, Lowrey said it's been hard to recruit officers. With limited human resources but a need to improve traffic safety, Lowrey began to think about solutions from an \"engineering\" standpoint.\n\"An officer sitting at a location, the impact ends soon after the officer leaves,\" he said. \"Engineering (and) other means are more of a 24-hour solution.\"\nLowrey added that it'll help not just residents, but his team of officers as well. The department will be better-equipped to answer questions such as, \"How many of these are left turn-related? How many of these are red light-related?,\" Lowrey said.\nThe dashboard is a step in completing a Strategic Highway Safety Plan for the town. Engle, Lowrey and Mayor Megan Cook have been working to develop the plan.\nLowrey said a Strategic Highway Safety Plan will open up the ability for the town to acquire grant funding. He pointed to Salisbury as a local jurisdiction that has embraced the state's \"Vision Zero' initiative that was passed by the state legislature in 2019.\n\"Behind it is the notion that you try to reduce fatalities and serious injury accidents down to zero,\" Lowrey said. \"It's a pretty big goal, a really difficult one.\"\nAccording to Lowrey, a plan outline for Easton will be completed in about a month. Engle told council members on Monday that a lack of data was perhaps the \"biggest problem\" for the town in terms of developing a highway safety plan.\nEngle said the dashboard will be a \"strong compliment\" to developing the plan in line with the Vision Zero initiative.\n\"I would hope by fall that we're at a place where we can present a finalized plan before the council with a pretty good idea that they're going to approve it,\" Lowrey said.\nThe interactive traffic dashboard can be accessed by visiting https://eastonmd.gov/196/Police and clicking on the dashboard image. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

C. Lynn Knight of the Queen Anne's County Circuit Court to 20 years, execution of the sentence suspended as to all but 18 years to serve for the drug offense and one year, suspended, consecutive, for the traffic offense. Upon his release from incarceration, Todd will be on 36 months of supervised probation.\nThe conviction was based on an April 13 incident in which Maryland State Police and Queen Anne's County Sheriff's deputies were on the look-out for a stolen vehicle, Richardson said. During attempts to make a stop on this vehicle, the driver fled. The vehicle pursuit ended in a foot chase behind a residence on Wye Mills Road in Wye Mills.\nRichardson said when Todd was apprehended, he was in possession of suspected cocaine, which was submitted for analysis at the Maryland State Police Crime Lab. The lab confirmed 11,892.2 grams of cocaine, a schedule II controlled dangerous substance. Further investigation by the Queen Anne's County Drug Task Force revealed Todd possessed this cocaine with the intent to distribute it. Members of the Task Force estimated the street value of this cocaine to be over one million dollars.\nTodd also had a 2019 conviction from Talbot County for Possession with Intent to Distribute. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jackson Women's Health Organization overruling Roe v. Wade may be the best worst thing to happen to Democratic politics in recent years.It is moving voters, and if there was any doubt of that, look at the results in Ohio this week, where a thinly disguised referendum designed to make it more difficult to pass a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights failed at the polls on Tuesday.Republicans had proposed an initiative to require a supermajority of 60% to amend the state Constitution - a special new requirement intended to make it more difficult to pass an abortion rights amendment come November.The biggest supporter of the initiative was the D.C. based Susan B.Anthony Pro-Life America.Voters smelled a rat - and turned out in record numbers to vote no. The amendment lost by 14 points in a state that Donald Trump carried by 8 points.We may not be as narrowly divided, not on every issue, not nearly as polarized, as the purveyors of fake news would have you believe.That bodes well for the efforts that began this week in another key state, where the effort is to place a constitutional amendment on abortion on the ballot in November 2024.The more states with abortion on the ballot in November 2024, the more the issue will drive votes to Joe Biden.This week, prochoice groups in Arizona announced that they had united and would begin a petition drive to collect enough signatures to put an amendment on the ballot in November 2024 protecting a woman's right to choose abortion prior to viability.The logic behind these efforts is simple and straightforward.Abortion drives votes. The polls are clear. Choice dominates.More than 60% of all Americans support Roe v. Wade. The Republican Party doesn't know how to deal with that without offending its base, which expects it to be proactive with a losing hand, a strategy that is doomed to failure.So it continues not only to fight losing battles against constitutional amendments proposed by pro-choice coalitions but also to engage in expensive and poorly conceived efforts like the one in Ohio, which was designed to circumvent the coming constitutional battle; Ohio is the only state with abortion on the ballot this November, and both sides have raised millions of dollars.The coalition supporting the Arizona initiative includes the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, NARAL Arizona, Affirm Sexual and Reproductive Health, Arizona List and Healthcare Rising Arizona.Current law in Arizona bans most abortions after 15 weeks. The proposed amendment provides for a right to choose abortion prior to viability, typically 22-24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for the life or health of the mother.The opposition is ready for a fight.In a statement, Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy told reporters, \"Our initial viewing of the measure reveals an extreme power grab by an industry that sees no limits to abortion.\" Maria Birnbaum, the Arizona state director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told reporters the proposal was \"repugnant to the values of our state,\" because \"Arizonans believe in protecting the unborn and serving their mothers.\" The point is: If the coalition can collect enough signatures, the voters will decide. And they will be the same voters who will be choosing who Arizona sends to the Electoral College.In a statement released on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs expressed her support for the coalition's effort and said she was \"confident that Arizonans will vote for reproductive freedom next November.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New virtual museum displays artifacts from home of Harriet Tubman’s father\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A new virtual collection of historic artifacts is shedding light on the early life of abolitionist Harriet Tubman and her father, Ben Ross.Archaeologists for the Maryland Department of Transportation led efforts in uncovering many items, such as plates, bowls and pitchers, in work done at Ross' home deep in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Dorchester County.\nExperts spent the last four years finding and identifying hundreds of artifacts. Julie Schablitsky, MDOT's chief of cultural resources, said it all began when they found an 1808 half-dollar coin on the site.\n\"That coin gave us inspiration to keep on digging and keep on working,\" Schablitsky said.\nEarlier this week, the department announced the artifacts and unveiled The Ben Ross Homeplace, an online museum since the physical site isn't open to the public.\nSome of the artifacts provide insight into Ross' life as an enslaved person in the 19th century, as well as Tubman's early years, during which she learned how to live off the land.\nArchaeologists found a lock to a door, which Schablitsky says may indicate Ross had some form of independence from his enslaver, Anthony Thompson.\n\"That's a bit of negotiated independence that not everybody would have had who was enslaved,\" she said.\nSchablitsky pointed out a tobacco pipe with a bald eagle. While many may assume it's a patriotic symbol, she says it could be a \"subtle signature\" of defiance.\n\"I wondered that, in his hand or the hand of Harriet Tubman and her mother, … if that was somehow a way of resistance — (if) that symbol was there for freedom rather than allegiance to the United States,\" Schablitsky said.\nSchablitsky and MDOT media relations manager David Broughton say the process of working in the wetlands of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge was demanding due to weather conditions, mosquitos, snakes and more.\nWhile the team knows the approximate area Ross' home was in, it didn't locate the exact markings or corners of the home. The exact location is \"lost to time,\" Schablitsky said, but the online museum preserves as much as possible.\n\"It could be a valuable tool … for teachers and their children,\" Broughton said.\n'RUSH AGAINST TIME'\nArchaeologists aren't just battling the elements. They're working on a limited clock.\n\"Climate change, sea level rise made digging very, very difficult,\" Schablitsky said. \"Within the next decade, I know that I'm not going to be able to return there.\"\nSchablitsky said even when work began back in 2021, environmental conditions impacted their work. Holes already dug would fill up with water after just a lunch break, Schablitsky said.\nSea level rise makes the preservation and historical work even more pressing, experts say.\n\"We're definitely in a rush against time,\" Schablitsky said. \"The waters are coming up, they're percolating up through the ground.\"\nAmid the challenges, descendants of Tubman and Ross were able to join archaeologists at the wetlands of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Schablitsky said the humility and gratitude they expressed to be able to dig at the historical site was impactful.\n\"The most meaningful part of the process was to have the descendants of Harriet Tubman and Ben Ross down on the site, walking where they walked, in her footsteps, in his footsteps,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The Zebra Gallery: a place for 'evolutionary' artists\n\n September 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For Susa Schauer, art has stayed consistent in her life no matter her career. Whether it was being a professional woodturner or a neuroscientist, her heart has kept its love for creativity.Schauer's The Zebra Gallery has provided Easton with a collection of \"evolutionary\" art and artists.\nHer journey to opening the business began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was diagnosed with cancer. She described her diagnoses as a wake-up call. It pushed her to make her dream gallery a reality.\n\"I thought if I'm ever going to open a gallery, maybe I should (now),\" Schauer said. \"Life is short. So this beautiful spot across in the Tidewater came open, and I kind of leapt into it.\"\nSchauer's decision to not wait allowed her to create a place that would not only help her through the pandemic and her illness, but also helped her establish a community she loved.\nSchauer said her choice in name for her gallery came as a bit of surprise to her. She did not have a particular connection with zebras growing up, but one day she received a text from her daughter-in-law saying her grandson, who was 3 years old at the time, had just been diagnosed at Johns Hopkins with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, an illness that affects the skin, joints and blood vessels.\nAfter some research, she learned the symbol for Ehlers Danlos Society is a zebra. The symbol called to her and she decided to name her gallery after the animal. Additionally, she made a commitment to give 10% of proceeds to Ehlers Danlos research.\n\"So I took the name Zebra Gallery, and thought it was destined to be,\" Schauer said. \"It has made just perfect sense for me in terms of where I am in my life, making this more than just about me, selling other people's art, but in fact, also giving back to some degree. So it feels like a really nice circle.\"\nNow, Schauer's gallery features local and international artists. Schauer said when looking for artists to feature in her gallery she seeks art that is evolving, risk-taking and intriguing. Though she has a love for traditional art, she said she wants to help foster high-end art with a contemporary spin.\nIn her own work, she has worked in a variety of media including portrait painting, woodturning and thread painting.\nIngrid Matuszewski, a featured artist at the Zebra Gallery, said she had been a long time admirer of Schauer's art and it has been a pleasure to work with Schauer in her gallery. Matuszewski, who got into portrait painting later in life, said working with Schauer has established a community of growth for her and her art.\n\"I think Easton has amazing galleries, so I think the Zebra Gallery complements the other ones in a way that maybe hasn't been there before and represented before because it's more of a contemporary take on art,\" Matuszewski said. \"I think Susan tries to get in touch with artists who just kind of have different viewpoints on things.\"\nAdam Himoff, a muralist at the Zebra Gallery, said Schauer's gallery is the first gallery he had been featured in. Her excitement for his work was magnetic, and her love for art in general drew him in.\n\"I met Susan, and she lights up a room and has some amazing energy,\" Himoff said. \"And we talked about my art and her art, and I shared photos of my other work. She had seen the mural before. And she was amazing. She just lit up, and without a millisecond passing just expressed so much excitement and interest in the work. And so it just seems clear that energy was very convincing.\"\nSchauer said she loves the people on the Eastern Shore, and the opportunity to have her gallery feature local talent, she said, has been wonderful.\n\"There really are so many spectacular people in this town and visiting this town, it's why I came here from grad school and never left 40 years ago,\" Schauer said. \"It's a beautiful area, and we have a remarkable group of both artists and buyers, and they're all wonderful people who have great stories to tell. So every day is a kind of learning and creating.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Johnny Mautz, R-37, and Del. Chris Adams, R-37B.\"When you look at the news and walk down the street, you know now, more than ever, we need prayer amongst the business community and our political leaders,\" Adams said.Mautz said the morning was \"very significant\" and called for applause to mark the occasion.The guest speakers were two local servant-leaders who work primarily with youth and are active in their local churches. They shared very different testimonies of how they see God working in their lives and the lives of others.Claudia Reyes emigrated from Guatemala as a child and serves in Hispanic youth ministries with her husband Eliud, the pastor of First Hispanic Baptist Church in Easton. They have been married for 29 years and have four children.Her ministry in the Talbot County Detention Center, where she hears stories of addiction and exploitation, has convinced her that \"evil is all around us.\" \"We live in bad times, and if you saw the news last night or have seen the news for a couple weeks, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I can assure you that God sees the evil and through God, lives are being transformed,\" Reyes said. \"As much as we have seen evil and destruction here in our community, we see more of God's grace and mercy.\" Referring to the rise of drug addiction and sex trafficking she is aware of, Reyes said, \"Our youth here in our community are not for sale for evil. They are to be rescued.They are to be saved.\" Reyes encouraged attendees to pray because \"prayer is very powerful,\" to become aware of the problems youth face and to \"do something.\" Raised on a farm near Cordova and active in the 4-H program, Linda Saathoff Brown is a lifelong member of Immanuel Lutheran Church. She called herself a \"farm girl, teacher, wife, mother and Nana.\" She has been married to Wesley Brown for 46 years and has taught in Talbot County Public Schools for 47 years.Sprinkling her talk with Bible verses and contemporary praise song lyrics, Brown shared \"My Story, God's Glory,\" borrowing a title of one of her favorite songs by Matthew West.On the exact one-year anniversary of a surgery following a life-threatening fall that could have left her paralyzed, Brown shared ten miracles she said were evidence of God healing her through the prayers of friends from Cordova to Trinidad.Despite dire indications that she may never walk again because of five vertebrae that were either \"crushed or cracked,\" Brown was able to return home without a walker and celebrate Thanksgiving with Amish friends from Lancaster, who brought a van load of food and the greeting, \"Our fervent prayers are answered,\" she said.\"Thanksgiving took on a whole new meaning\" and she \"has been blessed beyond measure,\" Brown said.Local clergy reading scripture and leading prayers were the Rev. Demetrius Price of Union Baptist Church; the Rev. Elmer Davis, a district superintendent in the Peninsula-Delaware Conference of The United Methodist Church; Kennedy Siaw, youth minister of Oasis Church; and C.B. Nagel of Cru, formerly Campus Crusade for Christ International.Before leading a prayer for leadership, Siaw challenged attendees to reflect on their reason for attending the breakfast and reminded them that \"true leadership is to become the servant of all,\" after the example of Jesus Christ.The Rev. Christian Jensen of Denton has been chaplain of the Maryland General Assembly for 23 years and attended the first Easton Mayor's Prayer Breakfast and \"most of the intervening 40,\" he said.He is also the Maryland representative for the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.\"It's a blessing to see an important tradition like this carry on through, regardless of what changes there are in political administration,\" Jensen said. \"To see something like this continue on is a good reflection on everyone's ability to get along with one another and understand what's important.\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nFrom left, Easton Mayor Megan Cook, the Rev.

    "title": "Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is complete",

    "content": "Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is complete\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 1257\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — The Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is built, running and ready for the next step in the Lakeside development plan, which is transferring ownership to the town of Trappe.Two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented during a recent Trappe Council meeting. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nThis controversial project has faced lawsuits, petitions and an array of public outcry over environmental concerns, but it is an essential step in moving forward with the Lakeside development.\nFirst proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside at Trappe development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50. The development is slated to include a mix of single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and commercial and retail spaces.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes. That flow will eventually be diverted to the new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved by county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nSpray irrigation systemThe new plant, set with enriched nutrient removal technology, uses a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Water Science Center, the sprayed wastewater either evaporates into the air, soaks into the soil or percolates through the soil and recharges the groundwater.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., a project management and civil engineering firm for Lakeside, said spray irrigation has been recognized for years by states and the federal government as a preferred method of treated wastewater disposal.\n\"It is an exceptional re-use method of disposal that recharges groundwater and can provide needed nutrients to agricultural ground covers,\" he said. \"Generally, spray irrigation does not require the highest levels of treatment, so valuable nutrients are available for plants to reduce farmers' costs for additional commercial fertilizer.\"\nRaunch said this is based on Lakeside's developer's voluntary election to provide enhanced nutrient removal level treatment to avoid groundwater nutrient increases. The MDE discharge permit establishes strict limitations on the discharge of treated wastewater, which results in the application of a fraction of the nutrient uptake requirements of the grass planted in the irrigation field.\nRaunch said that due to the high quality of the Lakeside wastewater effluent and the nutrient needs of the ground cover, there is no practical scenario in which the spray irrigation of treated effluent will negatively impact surface or groundwater.\n\"Ironically, the nutrient levels of the treated effluent will be so low that the farmer will have to apply fertilizer to the spray irrigation field to maintain a vigorous and healthy crop cover,\" he said.\nAlan Girard, advocacy director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, argued that nutrients absorbed into groundwater could eventually discharge into nearby impaired rivers and streams like the Choptank River.\n\"I don't think people understand that the state is claiming that there will be zero discharge of nutrients to groundwater,\" Girard said. \"The state has already demonstrated that there's a link between groundwater and surface water and surface letters that are tarred right near the discharge. So the state needs to be accountable for that issue.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit in, citing concerns about the spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs for ShoreRivers, said that the wastewater issue has been a concern for ShoreRivers due to the existing Trappe plant and how poorly it has been functioning and treating the wastewater before discharging it into Trappe Creek.\nAccording to Pluta, the Lakeside Plant is making noticeable improvements that were not seen in the old Trappe Wastewater Plant.\n\"I'll go on and say that one thing that's very clear and obvious is that there will be more treatment from this new plant,\" Pluta said. \"The wastewater will be treated to a cleaner standard. That's what we want to see. We support that. The thing that concerns us with the new plan is just the method of discharge. That's where they'll be spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields.\"\nPluta said the way the state permits spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields is under what he calls \"legal fiction or false assumptions.\" When someone is spraying wastewater on a farm field, that wastewater gets taken up by the plants.\nThrough studying agricultural practices, Pluta has learned of the impacts of runoff and pollution on groundwater. He said there are different incentives for someone operating a wastewater treatment plant compared to farmers caring for local crops.\nPluta stated that no farmer is applying nutrients to their crops every day throughout the whole growing season. There is an incentive for wastewater treatment operators to focus on controlling their volume and not so much on a healthy crop, which Pluta said is concerning for the sake of adding too much pollution to these fields.\nEach farm that receives spraying from the plant needs a nutrient management plan on how many nutrients can be put on the fields. Those plans were not public information, but because it was part of the treatment process, ShoreRiver argued to make that information public.\nIt was through the 2020 filed lawsuit that the permit was remanded to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which issued a new permit with fewer homes and less wastewater.\nA separate lawsuit was filed against MDE by concerned residents in May 2022 asking to revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewage system as inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan. Though the suits was ultimately dismissed last June, MDE issued a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day. A vast decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nOversightIn part due to the outcry and lawsuits made by residents and environmental organizations, a wave of resolutions were brought forward to better address concerns involving the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nOne that stood out to many was Resolution 338, which amended Talbot County's Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan. It requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan for any future expansion of the new Lakeside wastewater treatment plant.\nThough this was deemed favorable to the environmental organizations, there were many, including members of Trappe's council, that opposed the Lakeside resolutions.\nDuring a public hearing before the vote of Resolution 338, Brian Schmidt, Trappe Town Council president, commented opposing the resolution and stated that the county was treating Trappe differently than other towns, hurting the municipality's growth.\n\"We did not ask this council to intervene,\" Schmidt said. \"MDE is the controlling authority in matters of wastewater discharge, not the county. Disguising growth legislation as wastewater discharge is not proper procedure is only impeding the town's authority to control its own growth.\"\nNext stepsDuring the June 5 Trappe Town Council meeting, two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nAccording to Showalter, Once the initial phase of the wastewater treatment plant is complete and turned over to the town, the developer remains responsible for any deficiencies between the costs of operation and maintenance and the sewer revenues collected by the Town from Lakeside residents. Additionally, the developer remains responsible for the incremental expansion of the wastewater treatment plant as the capacity is utilized.\nFurther discussion on the transfer agreements will be discussed and reviewed during the Town Council's next executive session. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Phone pouches improving student focus, discipline in Caroline, district says\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 624\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An experimental pilot program aimed at keeping students off their phones saw some success in its first semester being implemented at Caroline County Public Schools.Cellphone pouches created by the company Yondr were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last semester.\n\"We've been pleased with the outcome, Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"You see attentiveness much higher in classrooms, kids learning how to talk to each other, even in the cafeteria. It's been really cool to see at the middle schools.\"\nThe students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside but not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phone are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nEvery classroom in Caroline County comes equipped with a wired phone for use in case of an emergency, and teachers have been given a special pair of scissors to cut through cellphone pouches if needed.\nFor students with health needs, the schools offer special services allowing students to check their phones for medical purposes only.\nThere have been talks within the county of expanding cellphone pouches to ninth graders in coming years, but that determination has not yet been made, district officials said.\nIn determining whether the pouch program will be expected, the district still has to weigh the pros and cons, officials said. They hope that by the end of the school year they will have a solid understanding of the program's successes and shortcomings.\nSUCCESSES\nThe pouches have done a good job at keeping students off their phones during the school day, district officials said. But beyond that, the middle schools where the pouches have been implemented have seen some other benefits from the program.\nThe cellphone pouches help prevent cyber bullying in the school during the school day, they said. Students have needed less disciplinary intervention since the pouches were rolled out.\n\"We've seen about a 21% reduction in discipline incidents,\" Simmons said.\nSimmons also said teachers report that taking cellphones out of the picture has allowed them to better focus on instructing students.\n\"We ask a lot of our teachers, most of our class sizes average 20 to 20 plus students, so if you're asking them to improve reading or improve mathematics on top of being able to see if they're on cellphones it's a lot,\" Simmons said. \"With the pouches they don't have to be the cellphone police.\"\nAlthough schools don't yet have test scores back for last semester, the superintendent said pass rates have gone up with the cellphone pouches.\nDIFFICULTIES\nReception of the cellphone pouches has not been entierly positive among students and parents in the district, Simmons said.\nStudents have tried to tamper with or break into their pouches during the school day on multiple occasions.\n\"They're not indestructible, they're not the end all be all, but they are a great preventative tool to put in place,\" Simmons said. \"They're easy to tell if somebody's tampered with one, It's also easy to tell if a kid has their phone or has a phone out because they don't want their pouch or pouches to look empty.\"\nSome parents do not like the idea of the phone pouches because they prefer to have a direct line of communication with their child, Simmons said.\nStudents have not yet been polled on their feelings about the pouches, but the districts plans to weigh student attitudes toward the program in any future decisions made.\n\"I think overall, we're seeing a positive impact on the academics, on the social skills piece. If we asked kids if they'd rather have access to their devices, I'm sure they would,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobbins on a one-year deal worth up to $5.25 million.A 2020 second-round pick by Baltimore, Dobbins has an extensive injury history, including an ACL tear in 2021 and a torn Achilles tendon in 2023, but he's been productive when healthy.\nHe gained a career-best 905 yards on 195 carries and tied his career high with nine rushing touchdowns last year with the Los Angeles Chargers despite missing four games with a sprained knee.\nWord broke of Dobbins' acquisition just as the first day of the Broncos' mandatory minicamp was wrapping up, and coach Sean Payton was coy when asked about, saying, \"I'm not going to answer to any reports. I think we're close.\"\nWhen Dobbins visited the team last week, Payton said: \"It's just another opportunity to possibly bring in another good football player to help us win.\"\nIf healthy, Dobbins figures to be one of the primary ballcarriers along with rookie R.J. Harvey, a second-round draft pick out of Central Florida. Other running backs on the roster include second-year pros Blake Watson and Audric Estime, third-year player Jaleel McLaughlin and fourth-year pro Tyler Badie.\nA lot will be expected of Dobbins on third down after the Broncos lost their best pass protector in their backfield when Javonte Williams left for Dallas in free agency.\nOne of Dobbins' best games last season was at Denver in mid-October, when he rushed 25 times for 96 yards and a touchdown in the Chargers' 23-16 win.\n\"Yeah, he's a good back, especially when healthy,\" Broncos safety Brandon Jones said. \"We kind of go back a little bit to high school and college, so I'm very familiar with him as a person and his game on the field. Yeah, he's a baller. He was one of the running backs that had the better rushing games against us last year.\n\"So, I'm super excited for him to be here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stauffer said that would run to the south of the museum and be the closer connection. However, the timeline on that is not set because the county has not yet awarded the contract, Stauffer said.\nCCFM received $95,000 in a 2021 bond bill from the Maryland General Assembly and $150,000 from the Upper Shore Regional Council. Museum directors figure $80,000 is needed to make the sewer connection.\nAnyone wishing to make a donation should go online to: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=H7E3DZ35WTSGW\nStauffer said that, regardless of the status of the sewer line, the building will likely be opened to the public sometime next year. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

JUST SAY NO AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!,\" Trump said.\nEarlier this week, Trump also said from the Oval Office he backed eliminating federal funding for public media.\nCongressional Republicans are looking at funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS and NPR stations nationwide.\nCPB received $535 million in the most recent annual federal budget. The nonprofit was created by Congress in 1967.\n\"Reducing or eliminating CBP funding would save the federal government little (maximum of $535 million) while having dire though not universally fatal consequences for public broadcasting,\" said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\nMontgomery contends the funding elimination push from Trump and conservatives is about their objections to what they see as NPR's and PBS' liberal slants.\n\"Make no mistake, if it happens, killing CPB will not be about saving money - this is about quieting voices and content that those on the right find objectionable or inconvenient,\" Montgomery said.\nSome of Trump's most ardent supporters in the GOP-controlled Congress also want to eliminate government money for public media.\n\"We will defund NPR and PBS!!,\" said U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, in a social media statement responding to Trump. \"The American people will NOT pay for disgusting Democrat propaganda anymore!!.\"\nGreene is critical of PBS' coverage of LGBTQ communities, including saying at a congressional hearing Wednesday that it promotes a \"trans agenda\" pointing to a local affiliate's airing of a segment featuring drag artists.\nDuring the same hearing on CPB funding Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, grilled NPR President CEO Katherine Maher about her progressive social media posts on white supremacy, reparations and civil unrest in 2020 and 2021.\nMaher became NPR boss in 2024.\nShe said her views have evolved, that NPR was working to offer a wider variety of perspectives in its coverage and had created new protocols to avoid bias, stressing the need for editorial independence.\nMaher also stressed the need for public media in rural and lower-income communities.\n\"Public radio is very often the only news service in places where market economics does not support the expense of local news,\" she told the House panel.\nMontgomery said NPR gets approximately 1% of its funding from CPB compared to roughly 14% for PBS.\n\"At the local level, an end of CPB funding would hit public TV harder than radio but public broadcasters of both types are likely to cut back, consolidate, or go silent,\" he said.\nPublic TV and radio stations and programs they produce would have to backfill any lost federal funding with money from other sources including donors, foundations and corporations.\nRick Ellis, founder and managing editor of Minnesota-based AllYourScreens.com (which tracks media news and industries), said defunding has been a desire of conservatives who either don't like government money for media outlets or \"what they consider to be liberal programming.\"\n\"They haven't been able to eliminate the spending in the past in large part because the areas that would be most impacted by the cuts are rural areas that are also Republican strongholds. And overall, government financing for public media is pretty popular with voters,\" he said.\nEllis points to a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday showing 24% of respondents favor nixing government funding for PBS and NPR, while 43% support public media funding and 33% are not sure.\n\"In theory, it would probably be politically less complicated for public media to move away from government funding. But while it is overall a small slice of public media financing, it's tough to replace any other way,\" Ellis said.\nHe said larger public media outlets in bigger, more affluent cities will survive the funding loss.\n\"But it would be enough of a loss to decimate outlets in Alaska, Hawaii and a number of Midwestern and Southern states, which are smaller and already struggle to get funding from foundations, viewers and listeners,\" Ellis said.\nA number of local and statewide NPR and PBS stations have not yet responded to requests for comments about defunding and how they might navigate a new financial landscape, including their ties to universities and community colleges (which are also under fire from Trump).\nThe Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 has called for defunding CPB in its austerity blueprints, citing liberal biases and questioning the necessity of government outlays.\nElon Musk, who owns the X social media platform and runs Trump's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, has also echoed conservative calls to defund public media, in particular NPR. Trump said earlier this week DOGE efforts could also target public media funding.\nIrina Tsukerman, president of New York-based Scarab Rising Inc. (a geopolitical consulting firm) said funding cuts could result in public media jobs cuts, less local programming and potentially station closures.\nShe also sees wider media impacts.\n\"Public media plays a unique role in the media ecosystem, providing high-quality, in-depth journalism that is free from the commercial pressures faced by corporate media,\" Tsukerman said, pointing to investigative, cultural and educational content that might not be pursued by other outlets.\n'The removal of federal funding would push these stations to rely more heavily on private donations and corporate sponsorships, potentially influencing editorial independence and leading to content shifts that prioritize profitability over public service,\" she said.\nTrump and his populist backers are vehement critics of many traditional media outlets, accusing them of liberal bias.\nTrump routinely calls journalists \"enemies of the state,\" frequently characterizing critical coverage of himself and his administration as fabricated or \"witch hunts.\"\nA number of major U.S. media outlets and social media platforms are owned by conglomerates such as the Fox Corp. and Walt Disney Co. or some of the wealthiest persons in the world such as Musk, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and Meta/Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe latter trio were all front and center at Trump's inauguration in January inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\"A weakened public media sector benefits those who prefer a media environment dominated by private interests, where corporate-backed outlets and partisan networks can exert greater influence over public discourse,\" Tsukerman said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's the only municipality in Talbot County that does not have one.\n\"This would allow any municipality to have up to one Class E establishment, so that way, residents of Trappe would have the same access to a store that others in the county have,\" he said.\nTown residents currently have to drive to Easton or Cambridge to shop at a liquor store.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher emphasized that the council does not issue liquor licenses — the county liquor board does — but the bill enables that the board to be able to review one for the town.\n\"Without this legislation, a new business would not be possible,\" he said. \"So this is enabling legislation for sure.\"\nThe bill was approved unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nichols Denton Church of the Seventh-day Adventists | Section: News \n \n 238\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Wherever we live, work or interact with others within or across communities, all of us benefit and are affected to one extent or another in sharing and collectively seeking solutions.We need each other to be engaged in building, improving, expanding, making our communities, making centers that are safe, friendly, economically stable, prosperous, spiritually uplifting, culturally welcoming, diverse and nurturing because this is indeed, our community our village.\nThe Bible supports the idea of the ancient African proverb, \"It takes a village to raise a child.\" The future of our community, as well as the future generations of communities, will only be as strong as the community we create by working together. I want to encourage you to find ways to get involved in your community (village). You will grow and the village will be blessed.\nToday, we are often influenced by external suggestions and realities.\nSocial media, personal devices, broadcastings from numerous sources., and from others promoting and soliciting our support are bombarding our isolation, our values, our \"joining\" or \"acceptance\" endlessly.\nJust remember, Jeremiah 10:23, informs and cautions us that it is not in us as humans in isolation nor under the influence of others to \"direct\" our ways. We can always turn to God's Word and enhance our abilities to participate within and across our communities in responsible, just ways that will position our contributions to work together with others to the benefit of all and meet God's approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCTC Masonry instructor surprised by coworkers on last day\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — On his last day of teaching at the Dorchester Career and Technology Center, Masonry Instructor Eddie Bailey wasn't the only one sporting a baseball cap, grey sweatshirt and jeans.More than 10 of his coworkers showed up and showed out in Bailey's well-known uniform. Some of his doppelgängers even brought their own fake metal detectors — a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things — from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DURRIE'S DEDICATION\n\n July 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 831\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The late Durrie Hayes would have enjoyed the afternoon of May 28, 2024, his light mustache unable to conceal that Cheshire cat-like smile.A large collection of friends, former players and assistants gathered in a loose, elongated semicircle inside the right-field foul line at Easton High's softball field on that spring day fit for a doubleheader.\nSoon bats would be swung, pitches hummed, ground and fly balls collected, and runs scored as part of the school's inaugural alumni softball game.\nNot everyone had come to play, but all had come to catch the pregame that featured speeches thick on compliments, and the unveiling of the newly erected scoreboard behind the center-field fence in Hayes' honor. And those who knew him well can pretty much imagine Hayes' reaction once his eyes settled on his name emblazoned across the top of the scoreboard in big, bold orange letters outlined in white on a black background.\n\"I can just picture him smiling that little smile he had,\" said Casey (Dulin) Baynard, a star on Hayes' early teams and now a Warrior assistant. \"I think he would have been very proud.\"\nDr. Ed Baker, the longtime umpiring legend who said, \"Hayes was by far the best softball coach that I every umpired a game for,\" agreed.\n\"Durrie was a very humble person,\" Baker said of Hayes, who died April 2, 2020 at age 70 after a brief battle with cancer. \"Naturally he would be very, very pleased and honored to see such a scoreboard. But he was never looking for his name to be in flashing lights.\"\nJay Cappa, an assistant during Hayes' 13 years at Easton, perhaps pegged the former head coach's reaction best.\n\"He would have said, 'Who'd a thunk it?'\" Cappa said. \"I do believe he would have said, 'Who'd a thunk it?'\"\nActually, it was Byrd Dog Wheeler who first thunk Hayes be memorialized, initiating the drive for a scoreboard honoring the school's Hall of Fame coach four years ago.\n\"It's incredible what that guy did,\" said Wheeler, another longtime friend and one of the ceremony's speakers. \"And that one run he had there; what the last eight years? Jeez Louise.\"\nHayes coached the Warriors from 1995-2007, compiling an impressive 232-46 record that included seven Bayside Conference championships, six regional titles and three state championships. Wedged in that 13-year stretch was an eight-year run (2000-07), where the Warriors went 162-18 that included a 23-0 season in 2004 — an unbeaten streak that was extended to 30 games the following year — three state championships and three state runner-up finishes.\n\"He put in all that time going to Little League girls softball games and travel team softball games, and talking to the parents and getting them involved, and getting them to buy into the program at such a young age,\" Wheeler said. \"By the time they got up to ninth grade they were on track and knowing what to expect and ready to play. No one else did anything like that.\n\"One thing he couldn't say is that, 'There's others out there that deserve that a lot more than I do.' Not a chance he could say that,\" Wheeler added.\nWell, now hold on there big dog.\nThere was in fact somebody who would have penciled himself into the leadoff spot to protest that very point — Hayes.\n\"It was always about the girls,\" Wheeler conceded. \"It wasn't about Durrie Hayes.\"\nOthers could easily see Hayes lobbying for his players' names to be adorned atop the scoreboard, instead of his.\n\"I think deep down he would have been very honored,\" longtime friend Debbie Urry said. \"But I think he would have been embarrassed because it should have gone to the girls. He was always about the girls. He never wanted that kind of attention. I think he would have been very humbled and surprised. And he would have given credit to all the girls he ever coached.\"\nJay Chance, who coached with Hayes at Easton and Chesapeake College, watched the skipper consistently direct praise his players' way.\n\"He never really made it all about him,\" said Chance, who presented Hayes during the induction ceremony for Easton High's inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame class in September 2019. \"It was more important to make a difference in the girls' lives than it was to win a game. That's what I liked so much about him. Although on game day you would never know that [laughing]. On game day it was about winning.\"\nOh, and the fun Hayes would have had filling out the lineups for both teams in the alumni game.\n\"He definitely would have loved the alumni game that we had after that,\" Baynard said.\nAs the ceremony wrapped up, Cappa and Chance reminisced and joked about what Hayes' take would have been on this big to-do.\n\"Jay said, 'Watch it. He's libel to send down a lightning bolt,'\" Cappa said laughing. \"I told Jay, 'He's not going to do it 'cause they're going to play a softball game. He ain't going to ruin the softball game.' He said, 'Yeah, I guess you're right.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

General John Cushing, who is the Commanding General; and U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command Sgt. Major Brian Haydt.\nThompson reportedly was his usual upbeat self during the party. Thompson relies on a wheelchair and is \"not able to eat regular by mouth,\" but he remains \"sharp as a tack\" mentally, one longtime friend described. The new Centenarian has outlived his children and his friends from childhood and young adulthood.\nAlso at the party was the woman Thompson married more than 40 years ago, Clarice Thompson, his second wife, whom he nicknamed \"Reesey.\" Thompson reportedly gets excited whenever he hears her name or learns that \"Reesey\" has come to visit him.\n\"He is the love of my life,\" Clarice said, before referencing his necessary VA residency and remarking, \"I miss him, but I know that he is where he is suppose to be.\"\nThompson is soft-spoken and is strong in his Christian faith, according to a few party attendees who were interviewed.\nHe served more than 40 years as the chaplain at the oldest African-American owned and operated nursing home in the state, Maryland Baptist Aged Home in Baltimore, where he volunteered once a week.\nA longtime member of a city Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon until age 94, Thompson also was active for more than 40 years in the Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore. In addition, Thompson provided usher, or deacon, training to parishioners throughout Maryland and other states, as part of an usher ministry associated with another one of the faith-based groups that he served.\n\"He's the kind of man who walks humbly and talks humbly. When he speaks, you listen,\" Clarice said. \"He's the kind of man I would recommend any young people to just take a photograph of him in their mind and take on some of his characteristics — other than Jesus' characteristics.\"\nClarice added, \"Not only was he disciplined in the military, he's a disciplined man as he walks with God.\"\nOne of the party attendees, Joseph Miller, president of that Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore, and his wife have been friends with Thompson and Clarice for more than 30 years.\n\"He is a wonderful guy. His smile is what gets you. He seems like a quiet person. His mannerism is quiet until you start talking to him. He's powerful. He talks softly, but carries a big stick,\" Miller commented with a chuckle. \"He loves to talk.\"\nAlong those lines, Thompson's favorite topic of discussion: The Bible.\n\"He loves the word of God, and he will share it with you. When I come here to the VA center and talk to the residents, they always tell me what he taught them about the word of God,\" Miller said.\nAfter retiring from his career as a Baltimore City maintenance worker, Thompson worked as an usher during Baltimore Orioles home games. He had that gig for three decades and was quite popular among spectators and all employees in the Baltimore Orioles organization.\n\"I was there when he got his 30-year ring, and he was proud of that (ring). They knew him well at the Baltimore Orioles, from the general manager, the manager, the players, the vendors, the mascot, and they all loved Kernie Thompson,\" Miller said.\nAn only child with an interest in woodworking, Thompson entered the U.S. Army at the tender age of 18 in 1943. Defending this country during World War II is among the many admirable contributions Thompson has made during his 100 years on this earth, thus far.\nThompson left his parents' West Baltimore home and traveled to Georgia, where he completed basic training. The military then sent Thompson to Camp Breckinridge in Kentucky, where he was put in the Army's 599th Ordnance Ammunition Company, which saw combat action after its deployment to Europe.\nDuring a Cecil Whig interview two years ago, Thompson recalled, \"Being overseas at war was a great experience, but some days were pleasant and some days were scary.\"\nThe following is an excerpt of some of the World War II remembrances Thompson shared during that interview:\nThompson noted that he enjoyed talking to not only his fellow soldiers, but citizens of the countries they were deployed to about their life and what it was like living in their country.\n\"They would ask about the United States and we would ask about their country and we would always talk to the people, we had a good relationship,\" Thompson said. \"With the soldiers, we would play cards and everyone always had something to say to make you laugh.\"\nBut when Thompson and his fellow soldiers weren't playing cards, telling jokes or talking with citizens, they were receiving ordnance shipments, supplying soldiers with ammunition and exercising their knowledge from basic training — something Thompson said his survival was contingent upon.\n\"What they teach you is important to your life, especially in combat,\" said Thompson. \"Your life might depend on what you were taught in basic training.\"\nThompson recalled that that training saved his life late one night in 1944, when his company was waiting for the arrival of a munitions shipment. After his group laid down to rest before the shipment arrived, they were awakened by the sight of enemy flares falling from the skies.\nAccording to Thompson, flares were used to illuminate areas at night so planes and infantry could properly identify enemy soldiers, weaponry and other valuable targets — such as the ammunition holds that Thompson's unit was responsible for.\n\"Basic training taught us that when they drop flares, don't move and turn your face to the ground,\" said Thompson. \"If you look up, the planes could see the glare of your face and it could mess up the dilation of your eyes. It was a scary night.\"\nIn 1945, after two years of his service, Thompson — who was then 21 — received word that the war was over.\n\"When we heard the war was over, it was a big joy,\" Thompson said. \"We shouted and we celebrated. When I got back, the first thing I did was go with my mother to see my grandmother and we had a nice dinner and celebrated.\"\nFollowing the war, Thompson got married, had a daughter and worked.\nReflecting on his wartime military service, Thompson commented, \"Being a part of the Army and serving my county was one of the most rewarding things because I felt like I was fulfilling a duty that I owed to my country and it makes me feel good,\"\nThompson then remarked, \"I am a blessed man to be here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black watermen share about challenges, changes on the Chesapeake\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANNIE HASSELGREEN Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 847\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum's Van Lennep Auditorium was packed on Saturday, Feb. 17, for \"Troubled Waters: Black Watermen,\" co-hosted by the St. Michaels Community Conversations on Race, the St. Michaels Community Center and the American Association of University Women.Panelists included Captain Lamont Wright, Reverend Dr. William Wallace, Edzel Turner and James \"Captain Buck\" Lynch, all of whom have been longtime watermen in varying capacities.\nThe men came together to engage in a dialogue about the successes and challenges of being African American watermen in honor of Black History Month.\nThey shared their diverse experiences on the waterways of the Chesapeake Bay with a crowd eager to learn more about the history of Black watermen on the Eastern Shore. Though the men shared similar perspectives, their roles on the water ran the gamut, but all agreed that conditions in the waters have changed drastically during their careers spanning many decades.\n\"My family owned a seafood factory in Bellevue,\" said Edzel Turner. \"Back then, we'd catch so many crabs that my arms would hurt.\"\nAll of the panelists agreed that government regulations have drastically shifted the profession in many ways.\n\"Regulations and sanctuaries will eventually drive away most watermen,\" Lynch said, \"and disease and the Conowingo Dam are decimating populations. We keep having to go further south (to catch anything).\"\nPanelists concurred that Black watermen in particular are an aging population that can't be replaced quickly enough.\n\"The youngest Black waterman is 60,\" Lynch said, \"and there won't be any left in 10 years.\"\nMany of the men are actively advocating for programs for young people to learn about life on the water so they can take the mantle for future generations.\nPresent in the audience was Vince Leggett, named \"Admiral of the Chesapeake Bay\" in 2003 by then Governor Parris N. Glendening. This is the highest honor a Maryland Governor can bestow on a private individual in the environmental arena ,and Leggett has been working for more than 30 years on preserving Black Americans' contributions to the maritime and seafood processing industries, and the Chesapeake Bay's rich culture and heritage.\nIn 1994, the Blacks of the Chesapeake Foundation began documenting this through a range of historical, cultural and educational activities. This included the \"Chesapeake Bay Through Ebony Eyes,\" a book that offers a history of African American contributions in the Chesapeake's maritime industries and includes a collection of seafood recipes, poetry, photographs and sketches; and a book entitled \"Blacks of the Chesapeake: An Integral Part of Maritime History,\" which provides a photographic history of African Americans at work as ship captains, sail makers, watermen and seafood processing plant employees.\nLeggett joined the panel to echo the sentiments of his fellow watermen about the challenges facing the industry and to continue to support their common desire to honor the legacy of Black Americans who have contributed so much to it.\n\"African Americans have spent their lives feeding the state of Maryland,\" said Wright.\nConversation also included experiences shared by many of the men having been targeted by racially-motivated repercussions.\n\"It wasn't uncommon for the marine police to check the oysters of Black watermen and fine them, but didn't check those of the white watermen,\" Wright said.\nTurner had a similar experience: \"I've seen police come to an area with 10 to 12 boats and ticket only the Black watermen.\"\nLynch has been on the water for 53 years and articulated the challenges for Black watermen to success in the industry. \"Blacks were unable to borrow money,\" he said. This meant that \"white watermen had better boats and better rigs.\"\nAlthough receiving loans for their businesses and inequitable fines have been a challenge, Wallace stated that watermen on the whole are a supportive group.\n\"There is a camaraderie among Black and white watermen. That isn't what perpetuated the division,\" he said. Instead, he says, unfairly targeting Blacks occurred mainly by the marine police and those charged with seafood counts.\n\"When I was a kid, my dad was a waterman, and I noticed that he was always the lowest on the leaderboard. He always had the lowest numbers,\" Wallace said. \"There was a white man who I figured out was throwing a lot of his catch into an uncounted float.\"\nBlack representation in the watermen industry remains stunted. Of the 30 members of the Queen Anne's County Watermen's Association, for example, there are three Black members and 27 white, Lynch said.\nBut there is an active group of Black watermen and their supporters who continue to advocate for acknowledgement of the tireless efforts of their community. Also present in the audience were Drs. Dennis and Mary DeShields, founders of the Bellevue Passage Museum.\nDennis DeShields, a fourth-generation descendant of Bellevue, resolved to preserve the town's rich heritage and is leading the charge alongside wife to present this history to a wider audience and \"serve as a center of cultural conservation for the community.\"\nFor some of the panelists, being out on the water daily is a collection of fond memories, but Captain Buck still ventures out most days — and wouldn't have it any other way.\n\"If you're a waterman, you get up with the sun,\" he said. \"And I'm my own boss.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In today's deal, a defender fooled declarer by dropping an unnecessarily high card. However, it helped that he had calculated his \"generosity\" couldn't cost a trick.\nIn four hearts, declarer won the first trick with his club ace and cashed the heart ace, \"dropping\" West's queen.\nWorried that East had four trumps, South immediately ran the diamond 10. East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Victoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said the theme for this year is \"Ser Hispano, es Ser Valiente,\" which translates to \"Being Hispanic is Being Brave.\"\nThe top three posters win prizes, and the first place poster will be used as the official poster for the 2025 Hispanic Heritage Month in Easton.\nRoxana Tapia, judge of the competition, said the first, second and third place winners this year came from various ages and ethnicities. But they all had the common goal of celebrating Hispanic heritage.\n\"You don't even have to be a Latina in order to participate,\" Tapia said. \"What I liked about this year is that we have people from all ethnicities. So if for any kids, I invite them to come over and participate, it's always fun. (Artists) should be proud of their work.\"\nThe winners of this year's competition were Piper Hambleton and Ellis Williams for their collaborative work. Their poster portrayed a large tree with flags from every Latin American and Hispanic country attached to its branches.\nAlberto Gamez, a judge and ChesMRC board member, called the colorful art piece \"The Tree of the Nations.\"\n\"I love that it was like a tree of life, but each branch had a different nation, and they covered a lot of them. So I love that it included everybody,\" Gamez said.\nGamez said he enjoyed all the art submitted this year and the various stories attached to the works, including third place winner Ahias Murillo, whose portrait \"I Paint My Own Reality\" showed Frida Khalo with an array of Latin American flags behind her. According to Gamez, the piece spoke on the identity and growth of Latinos.\nThe second place winner Majo Arrivillaga, whose portrait of two faceless individuals was meant to depict the different faces migrants have while traveling to the United States, also included a colorful landscape of Guatemala.\nArrivillaga said she loves drawing because it allows her to show people the beauty within the Latino community and encourages Latino artists of all ages to take the leap and share their work with their community.\n\"Being Hispanic, for me, is being a person who works, studies and centers their family,\" Arrivillaga said. \"We are multifaceted and we can do it all. That's what makes us brave.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It had won with 11 seconds remaining in regulation. It had won on a penalty stroke and in a 1v1. And it continued to find paths to victory no matter how big the game.\nBut Wednesday night against top-seeded Manchester Valley, the Warrior offense rarely found its way into the circle and had its storybook season ended in a 3-0 loss to the Mavericks in a Class 2A state semifinal at Glen Burnie High School's Pop Whayland Stadium.\nManchester Valley (16-0) advances to Saturday's 11 a.m. Class 2A state championship game where it will meet three-time defending state champion Glenelg (16-0) at Stevenson University's Mustang Stadium.\n\"I'm so proud of them,\" said Easton head coach Kim Neff, whose team had its eight-game win streak ended, finishing the year at 12-4. \"Taylor Bowen again had so many shots on her that she was able to save. They battled many corners clear. It was a defensive-heavy game and they handled it very well.\"\nIndeed, the Mavericks, who had blanked their previous three playoff opponents by a combined 27-0, were held to their lowest goal total of the postseason.\n\"Their whole team, they played hard,\" Manchester Valley head coach Denean Koontz said. \"They did a very nice job of doubling us. They took us out of our game plan a little bit. They stepped to the ball very well. Defensively, they were on us everywhere. They did a very nice job of smothering the ball and smothering our players.\"\nThe Mavericks finished with 11 corners before Easton earned its first with only 1 minute, 26 seconds remaining in the game.\nBy then the No. 1 seed had already built a three-goal cushion that was started off a pair of first-quarter corners.\nBowen, Easton's freshman goalie, and her defense weathered Manchester Valley's first two corners in the opening 5 minutes. The Mavericks were awarded their third corner less than 3 minutes later and converted, as Lily Brookhart scored off Shelby Wurzburger's assist for a 1-0 lead.\nManchester Valley earned its fifth corner with 13 seconds remaining in the first quarter, and again capitalized, with Allie Largent setting up Brookhart's second goal with no time showing on the clock.\n\"They were aggressive,\" Neff said of Manchester Valley, which held Easton scoreless for the first time since a 1v1 loss to Queen Anne's on Oct. 1. \"And their stick skills were incredible.\"\nBowen made a save on the Mavs' first corner of the second period, and watched her teammates foil a second corner near the end of the period.\nBut Easton generated little offense, the long rushes downfield by Olivia Orrell and Addie Knox were often and quickly stopped well short of the circle.\n\"I do feel like my girls held their own,\" Neff said. \"And I think this is where it really comes into play not having a turf field, and not being able to practice on a turf field, and play on a turf field. It's hard to keep up with the competition. Their whole team was just fast.\"\nManchester Valley picked up three more corner chances in the third, but could not add to its lead as Bowen registered two more saves on corners.\n\"Our defense, our middies, they all stepped up,\" Neff said. \"I will say I feel like each quarter we came out a little more aggressive cutting to the ball better. I feel if we had one more quarter you might have seen maybe a goal.\"\nManchester Valley put away one more goal with only 4 seconds left on the third-quarter clock, when Carroll County scoring leader Amanda Herrold scored on a breakaway.\nThough they continued battling, the Warriors mounted few threats and got their first corners in succession with 1:26 left, when Mavericks' goalie Makayla Shoaf registered her lone save.\n\"They played hard,\" Koontz said of Easton. \"They did a great job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "CWDI and Dorchester County Council not in violation of Open Meetings Act\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Maryland's Open Meetings Compliance Board has found Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. and the Dorchester County Council not in violation of the state's Open Meetings Act for a Nov. 13 closed meeting held by CWDI.In its opinions delivered Feb. 1, the OMCB stated that CWDI was not in violation of the act because it is not a public body. It did not find the County Council in violation of the act because the council did not go into a \"meeting\" at the Packing House Nov. 13.\nAt the meeting, which brought together city and county officials and development consultants, CWDI justified going into closed session using two exceptions listed in the Maryland Open Meetings Act: \"to consider a matter that concerns the proposal for a business to locate, expand, or remain\" and \"to discuss a matter where public discussion would adversely impact the public body's proposal process.\"\nCWDI, a nonprofit that was formed by the City of Cambridge, Dorchester County and the State of Maryland, has been tasked with planning and developing space along the Cambridge waterfront, known as Cambridge Harbor.\nPlans include public spaces like a promenade and parks, a boutique hotel and residential and mixed-use spaces along the Choptank River.\nCWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard said that during the meeting, CWDI talked about business deals it is working on.\nBefore CWDI entered into closed session on Nov. 13, WHCP reporter Jim Brady and Star Democrat Executive Editor Jim Johnson objected to the meeting being closed to the public.\nFollowing the meeting, the Star Democrat and WHCP sent a complaint to the OMCB, alleging nine potential violations of the Open Meetings Act, including that the agenda topics were not consistent with the exceptions CWDI used to justify the closed meeting. The complaints were directed toward CWDI and the Dorchester County Council.\nAlthough City of Cambridge staff and elected officials were also present at the November meeting, the Star Democrat and WHCP did not allege violations regarding the city's involvement in the meeting.\nCity Council voted against going into closed session at the Nov. 13 meeting, and one commissioner left so the city would avoid an Open Meetings Act violation.\nOMCB OPINIONSAccording to the Feb. 1 opinions document, the OMCB found that CWDI didn't violate the Open Meetings Act because the non-profit is not a public body, and the act only applies to public bodies.\nTo determine whether CWDI could be considered a public body, the OMCB looked at how the entity was created and how its members were appointed to the board.\n\"As we have said before, '(p)erhaps the Maryland General Assembly might decide at some point to broaden the definition, so as to encompass all entities that carry out public functions,'\" the opinions document says.\nLeonard said he was not surprised by the decision made by the Compliance Board. He said it affirmed what CWDI \"has said since it's beginning\" — that it is a private corporation set to a public mission.\nThe reason CWDI listed the Open Meetings Act exceptions before going into closed session, he said, was to make CWDI's public partners feel comfortable.\n\"We list those exceptions, although we're not required to,\" Leonard said. \"It's something we've done as a courtesy out of respect for our public partners since the beginning.\"\nBrady, who objected to the Nov. 13 closed meeting, said it would be good for the state legislature to review what is considered a public body.\n\"I just find it unfortunate and unfathomable that an organization that's spending that kind of public money and ruling over that kind of land is not open to the public,\" he said.\nThe OMCB found that the Dorchester County Council didn't violate the Open Meetings Act because the Nov. 13 \"gathering\" wasn't a County Council meeting.\nAccording to the opinions document, although all members of the council attended the gathering, the question was whether the Council \"convened to consider or transact public business.\"\nThe OMCB said it could not conclude the gathering was a meeting based on the record presented.\n\"As we understand it, then, the Councilmembers attended the gathering to receive information, but the discussion was not a step in the Council's decision-making process regarding an item that was certain to come before the Council,\" the document says.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he was glad to see the decision that was made.\n\"There was never an intention for the Dorchester County Council to be violating any confidence of trust,\" he said.\nIn its opinions, the OMCB noted that \"the appearance\" of business being secretly conducted doesn't \"serve the purpose\" of the Open Meetings Act to \"increase the faith of the public in government.\"\n\"Our conclusion in no way condones the action of a quorum of the (Councilmembers) in creating what was, at the least, an appearance of impropriety,\" the board said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It isn't his first cross-country bike ride.In 2023, Kessinger biked from Baltimore to San Francisco in 70 days.\nKessinger's motivation for biking across the country came from a book called \"The Happiness of Pursuit\" by Chris Guillebeau.\n\"I kind of initially had an idea to do some sort of long-distance bike ride and specifically bike across the country after reading a book,\" Kessinger said. \"... It just sort of inspired me to think about doing something kind of crazy in the eyes of the most people or embarking on some sort of adventure or just exploring more.\"\nShortly after reading the book, Kessinger learned about the Ulman Foundation, a company the specializes in supporting young adults with cancer. The foundation participates in holds a bike-riding fundraiser, and Kessinger signed up.\nThe group raised $161,828 during their 2023 ride to San Francisco. Kessigner raised $7,431.\nWith new hopes on the horizon and used biking gear, Kessinger's sets his eyes on biking from Easton to Montreal, Canada this summer.\nAlthough Kessinger will not be raising funds during this ride, his friend Keisuke \"Jima\" Nakajima, who will be joining Kessinger from Baltimore to Montreal, is raising funds for the Ulman Foundation.\nNakajima then will take transportation back to Baltimore from Montreal, leaving Kessinger by himself for the grueling bike home.\n\"The decision to go from my home in Easton to Canada is sort of born out of like being able to go somewhere that I've never been and do it all under my own power,\" Kessinger said.\nDuring Kessinger's trip in 2023, the other bikers on the trip had built relationships in the past to find places for the group to stay the night. They also had help from the foundation.\nBut for his trip this summer, Kessinger plans to coordinate sleeping arrangements, showering and food through meeting new people and an app called Warm Showers.\n\"It's specifically for cycle tourists, so people doing long-distance bike rides, and you can make an account, and you can be a host on there. And so you can connect with these hosts who are all over all over the world,\" Kessinger said.\nKessinger's job as a dog sitter, gave him opportunity to train for the grueling bike ride. He biked from client to client. Kessinger established a savings with money from high school work and an internship after he graduated from the University of Maryland.\nKessinger's message to anyone scared of taking on new opportunities or trying something different is to just \"give it a go.\"\n\"Try it,\" Kessinger said. \"Say say when all of those reasons come up of why you know this can't work or you shouldn't do it. Just see what it feels like to ignore those and what it feels like to to say yes, because you'll figure out the rest later.\"\nTo follow along with Kessinger, follow is his blog at teamtahoe.substack.com/.\n. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, Espinal was arrested by ICE agents early Monday morning after stopping by Lowe's to pick up material for a job site.\n\"He didn't see anything suspicious. He put the material in the car, but then when he went to McDonald's to get something for breakfast, he saw a car behind him that looked kind of weird,\" Cordero said.\nICE agents followed Espinal to the Easton pool, ultimately arresting him on Route 322. He was taken to the Salisbury holding center. \"He preached to them all the way to Salisbury,\" Diaz said.\nFrom 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Espinal's family had no clue of his whereabouts. \"We were about to do a report on a missing person because we didn't find out until almost 12:30,\" Diaz said.\nDiaz said Espinal had no criminal record.\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, immigration arrests have doubled in the state of Maryland. More than 600 immigrants arrested during this time had no former criminal charges, according to the Deportation Data Project.\nEspinal has three children and a large extended family that he cares for, Diaz said. Tred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell referred to him as a pillar of the community.\nEarlier this month, Espinal spoke at Foxwell's son Darren's funeral. Diaz said Darren and her brother were best friends and his death has been hard on Espinal and the family.\nDiaz said she has received over 10 character letters on her father's behalf since his arrest yesterday morning, including one from Foxwell.\n\"It wasn't until I got to know him, however, that I saw how he honors and embodies the values of Christ in every aspect of his life,\" Foxwell wrote in a letter to ICE.\nEspinal's family has tried obtaining citizenship legally for years, but due to backlogs and expenses, Espinal remained undocumented, Diaz said.\n\"He's contributing to this country, and we're just trying to do it the right way,\" Diaz said. \"You know, unfortunately, with everything going on, everyone's a criminal apparently, but we're just hoping for the best and just to get him out of there.\"\nDiaz said each phone call Espinal makes from the detention center costs $50 for a 20-minute call and bond amounts for release currently range from $10,000 to $15,000.\n\"I've heard stories that people say, 'But why didn't you do it the legal way? Why aren't you doing it the legal way?' It's not easy,\" Diaz said. \"You know, if you're not in that person's shoes, you shouldn't be judging, and you shouldn't be criticizing.\"\nEspinal's family is relying on their faith and are hopeful that he will return home.\nICE could not be reached via phone to comment on this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Salt truck crews work to keep ice at bay and local businesses open\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 517\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Up before dawn, the team came with pallets of salt, ready to get their jobs done and help local businesses stay open, despite icy weather.Darrell Doupnik, the owner of Greenshore, an Easton-based landscaping company, has been providing salt and snow plow services in the winter for 40 years.\nHe met with his crew Friday morning to discuss their strategy for keeping walkways and parking lots ice-free for the company's roster of commercial clients.\nSome members of the team, like foreman Jerry Widener, have years of experience with winter weather.\n\"I have been doing this for 15 years,\" Widener said. \"I got up at 5 this morning. It's no big deal. I am used to it.\"\n\"In the winter we are clearing snow. When it snows, we are out here pushing snow. I am a pushing guy today, but I will do whatever it takes,\" he said.\nAccording to Widener, Friday's temperatures, though frigid, were high enough to keep the workload manageable for the team.\n\"If it gets too cold, the salt doesn't work,\" Widener said. \"I am the foreman today. I have five guys working for me. But for this, today, it is not too cold, and the salt works well.\"\nRock salt, lots of it, gets put in a spreader, which is attached to the back of a pickup truck for crews to drive around clients' roads and parking lots.\nDoupnik said the team used over 100 40-pound bags of salt to handle Friday's workload, purchased from Site One landscaping supply.\n\"It is not cheap. Salt costs $450 a ton,\" he said. \"We get them in 40-pound bags. You can put six bags at a time in the tailgate salt spreader.\"\nFriday's storm brought upwards of three inches of snow to Easton and upwards of four inches to the town's north and east, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn more intense winter weather, Doupnik said, the team requires even larger quantities of salt, and staying ahead of the icy roads can be a strain on their bodies.\n\"This (storm) is a piece of cake. It is not really blowing. The six- to 10-inchers, you are out for two days. It sucks. You go home and try to get some rest, and then you are back out fixing it up. You just go back out there,\" he said.\nIn his 40 years of plowing snow, Doupnik has learned the value his team's hard work provides to not only his customers, but to the community as a whole.\n\"For commercial clients, you kind of have to provide it. They like an all-inclusive package,\" he said. \"We do a lot of banks, we do these private schools and the churches. People still go to church. People still bank, and they have got to go to school. These places have to be open — especially the banks. We were out early this morning getting the banks opened up. Since schools are out, we do them last.\"\nDoupnik said the community often shows appreciation for what his crew does.\n\"My guys get treated very well. My customers give them stuff a lot — especially at Christmas time,\" he said. \"These are good guys, hard workers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A yacht to do: Bay Bridge Boat Show comes to Kent Narrows\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 601\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n KENT NARROWS — Setting sail into the boating season with a new charter, the Bay Bridge Boat Show is coming to the Kent Narrows area at Safe Harbor Narrows Point April 11 through April 13.After 26 years at the Bay Bridge Marina, the new venue at Safe Harbor Narrows Point promises to retain the spirit attendees love while strengthening community fellowship alongside even more amenities and better parking.\n\"We are extremely excited that we were able to keep the Bay Bridge Boat Show in Queen Anne's County and think the new location at Safe Harbor Marina Kent Narrows will only enhance the economic impact to the region,\" Heather Tinelli, director of Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development said. \"It is our hope that patrons of the boat show will stay overnight, enjoy all of our wonderful dining options, shop locally and of course buy a boat.\"\nWhether boat enthusiasts looking to buy a new vessel or those looking for a day on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay, the powerboat show is complete with services, products, exhibitions and shipshape retail therapy.\nCommunity and conservation are a focus of this year's spring power boat show, according to Annapolis Boat Shows' President, Mary Ewenson.\nCommitted to sustainability and conservation and environmental impacts, the boat show is proud to welcome numerous non-profits, and environmental organizations highlighting resources with free seminars, including the Department of Natural Resources, Coastal Conservation Association of Maryland, and the Department of Agriculture.\n\"Getting people excited about boats is a good way to get excited about the Chesapeake Bay. If you don't get out on the Bay you don't know it needs protecting, Ewenson said.\nShe is excited that by partnering with local businesses and building connections with the community, the show really connects with the community and emphasizes local involvement.\nWelcoming attendees by land and water, both local and away, the boat show offers a unique opportunity to showcase the culture of the surrounding Kent Narrows, including additional shopping, restaurants, hotels, businesses, and the Cross Island Trail.\n\"It will really benefit the whole area. This is not a convention center, this is people's lives and businesses,\" Ewenson said of this year's show venue.\nIn addition to showcasing the local area, the boat show also seeks to provide accessibility to anyone with maritime interests, with onsite hands-on training available to make any land lubber sea worthy of a new vessel.\nWith new powerboats on the market to behold, an expanded demo dock will offer attendees the opportunity to climb aboard a wide array of powerboats of every style and size. From fishing boats and trawlers to pontoon boats and luxury cruisers, last year's powerboat show saw more than 250 boats, and at least as many are expected this season, she said.\n\"If you're a seasoned boater or a first timer, the show will offer something new for everyone to explore,\" said Annapolis Boat Shows' General Manager Sheila Jones.\nMarine industry career networking opportunities will also be available alongside information about nearby boating clubs and schools.\nAnd a great aspect of spring shows is that you can take your new boat out on the water right away, she said.\n\"Whether you're here for the boats, the education, or the food and entertainment, it's always a ton of fun. And the beautiful new venue means visitors may board even more exciting new powerboats and shop everything from gear and accessories to electronics, communication equipment, education, clubs, and more.\"\nShuttles will run between the lot at the old outlets off Exit 41 and the show.\nAn event certainly not to 'skiff', you can 'ketch' more information about the Bay Bridge Boat Show and other local shows at BayBridgeBoatShow.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Songs about the water - Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum continues Changing Chesapeake series\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 703\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - Back in the early 1990s, Peter Panyon was taking part in a weeklong workshop for college professors focused on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries when inspiration struck while cruising the Patuxent River.\"It occurred to me: Wait a minute, there's a story to tell here,\" Panyon remembered.\"I was thinking, 'Man, somebody should write a song about that, and nobody's going to do it if it's not me.'\" A biology professor by trade, Panyon would write and re-write the song over the years on the way to perfecting \"Can't Work the River.\" The ballad tracing a watermen's struggles was included on his band Big Tribe's debut album in 2014, and its music video is now part of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum's special exhibition The Changing Chesapeake.At 7 p.m. on Sept. 28, Panyon and his Big Tribe bandmates Bonnie Eyler and Joe Huette will present \"Songs About the Water,\" an evening of songs and stories with a dose of science at the museum's Van Lennep Auditorium.This \"Changing Chesapeake Coffeehouse\" concert will feature fare provided by Blue Heron Coffee of St. Michaels and highlight songs drawing inspiration from local rivers to the Gulf oil spill and hurricane disasters.The suggested ticket price is $15 per participant for this event, which is sponsored by the Upper Shore Regional Folklife Center. To register and get more information, visit cbmm.org/SongsAboutWater.Panyon has married two of his passions in coming up with a catalog to fill a concert like this.The Calvert County resident is now retired after a lengthy career teaching biology at the University of Maryland, Catholic University and Prince George's Community College.As a musician, Panyon has written hundreds of songs, dating back to his teenage years. Recently, he's catalyzed Big Tribe, which has released two albums of eclectic rock tracks with a new one, \"Postcards from the Mission,\" due out later this year.Those experiences have helped Panyon carve out a unique lane as a songwriter with something to say.\"Your normal rock and roll about cars and girls, that's not what we do,\" Panyon said. \"What we're really up to is trying to hit people with music that, while they're having fun with it, there's a message in there that hopefully we get them to think about.\" The \"Can't Work the River\" video debuted in 2016 at a conference on teaching science through alternative media at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.Now, the 5-minute, 25-second video that features two watermen from different generations grappling with the realities of working the Patuxent River is finding a new audience as part of The Changing Chesapeake, which is on exhibit through next March.\"I want to at least crack open the door that leads to thinking about this scientifically,\" Panyon said. \"Yes, it's a story about a guy, and he lost his woman, and he's having trouble making a living, but when you dive beneath the surface of that story, there's this other story about what's actually going wrong. Why is this way of life that's millennia old getting more and more iffy?\" In concert, Panyon aims to expand on these important themes.While Big Tribe's albums feature big sound from a full band with bass drums, electric guitars, and an array of complementary instruments, its acoustic shows with Panyon, Eyler, and Huette are more easygoing, free-flowing, and even interactive.\"It's not just music,\" Panyon said. \"We're going to throw a little science in, and we're totally open to having a dialogue.\" The set list for these live shows goes in different directions with various meditations on the importance of valuing our waterways, including another track with roots in the 1990s and a literal earnestness to its title, \"We Are the River.\" As he prepares for his CBMM gig, Panyon is excited that he's found a perfect partner to help him share these songs that mean so much to him.\"Most bands are looking to play big venues like stadiums,\" Panyon said with a chuckle.\"For us, it's museums. We want to do as many museums as possible, and once we've conquered the museum world, then we're going for the stadiums.\" \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nChesapeake Bay Maritime Museum will welcome Peter Panyon and Big Tribe to campus on Thursday, Sept. 28, for \"Songs about the Water,\" an acoustic concert of songs and stories with a dose of science. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore Delegation discusses birds, trails and historic preservation\n\n January 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: General Assembly \n \n 881\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Eastern Delegation of the Maryland General Assembly brought forth topics pertinent to constituents, including the avian influenza recently swooped into the area and developments of community connectivity at its first weekly delegation meeting of this session Jan. 17.Secretary of Natural Resources Josh Kurtz presented updates regarding avian influenza outbreaks and noted the Department of Natural Resources has expanded its long-term contract with the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide more wildlife technicians to dispose of dead birds that could be carrying the disease.\nDel. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) noted disappointment with DNR's recent response to the avian influenza and reiterated better communication is needed for concerned citizens to get help they need without a runaround.\nKurtz noted the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control was also following a similar model and the two states are now working to stay consistent in informing the public on available tools.\nKurtz noted additional DNR developments for the Eastern Shore, including working with Caroline County on a public lands bill to assist Program Open Space funding.\nFunds that come into DNR's \"user pay, user benefit,\" model go directly to programs to benefit the community, he said.\nDNR recently received one million dollars from the Middle Chesapeake Sentinel Landscape Resilience Project for easement purchases near Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Bay, according to Kurtz.\nDNR also received a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency for $43 million to improve forest management on 1,000 acres of the Eastern Shore and help develop a regional forestry management plan, he said.\nTRANSPORTATIONFocusing on long term strategic planning to improve operating rail lines, the Maryland Department of Transportation is moving toward the establishment of a public-private partnership, according to Jaclyn Hartman, assistant secretary of transportation investments.\nThe Eastern Shore has a total of 92 miles of rail line, with 65 in active use. The rail lines are currently owned by the Maryland Transit Administration and operated by the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company, Hartman said.\nWith the current operating lease is expiring, MDOT is thinking strategically about how to secure a long term operator and improve service delivery and maintenance on those routes.\nMoving to a public-private partnership will ensure one entity has authority, rather than it being split between the operator and the state. The partnership will instigate long-term plans for the rail lines, \"and unfortunately that's one of the things that we're kind of lacking today,\" Hartman said.\nFor the maintenance of the rails, MDOT would establish a private financing, expecting the private operator to invest some of its own money in the rail lines with the ability to keep those revenues in the future as a return on investment.\nMDOT considered the project a win-win opportunity that most closely resembled the successful Seagrit Marine Terminal public private partnership established in the Port of Baltimore in 2008, Hartman said.\nIn the next couple of months, MDOT will begin industry outreach and move forward on requests for proposals for the private operator.\nMARITIME MUSEUMPresenting an outline of program facilities preserving the cultural legacy of the state, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum officials sought the Eastern Shore Delegation's help replacing aging HVAC systems in two buildings filled with irreplaceable artifacts.\nPete Lesher, chief historian for the museum, noted since 1965, CBMM has been dedicated to visitors and locals alike, preserving the environment and cultural heritage of the area as a tourism center, as well as a community museum.\nCBMM preserves 90,000 objects of historical significance and tell local stories of the Bay at its campus in St. Michaels.\nThe museum also serves as a key economic driver for the Eastern Shore, bringing in visitors and millions of dollars to the area, said Jeff Vogel, CBMM Government Relations Committee chair.\nRecognizing it was an exceedingly difficult budget season, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) noted CBMM was more than a local asset, but a landmark of history for the state.\nTRAIL NETWORKSeeking to connect the area and strengthen community through the Maryland Eastern Shore Trail Network, Owen Bailey, director of land use and policy of the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, and Patti Stevens, chair of the Worcester County Bike and Pedestrian Coalition, presented visions and goals to connect communities through a safe and sustainable trail network.\nThe mission of the Eastern Shore Trail Network Group is to galvanize a coalition of communities to support, plan, promote and advocate for diverse trail systems, Bailey said.\nSmaller municipalities in particular on the Eastern Shore wanted more trails but lacked capacity, expertise, and funding to plan, develop and design, according to Bailey.\nWhile the Eastern Shore represent 30% of the state's landmass and areas of recreation and economic development impact, it only included about 9.2% of the state's roads-separated trails, Stevens said.\nThis deficit came to light with updates to MDOT's five-year bike and pedestrian plan, according to Stevens.\nInteractive mapping across the state marked trails as green and while urban areas like Baltimore and Annapolis had so many green off-road trail markings \"it looked like plates of robust pesto spaghetti,\" Eastern Shore counties merely had \"little flecks of parsley,\" according to Stevens.\nTrails have benefits to economic development as well as to health, and as a safe transportation alternative, Stevens said.\nDel. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said electric bicycles are good options for mobility but speed can be issues on trails and should be addressed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He spoke to real impacts of authoritarian governments of the past, but also to those currently taking hold, around the world and potentially, right here in America.\nLarry's thoughts, observations and quotes, particularly this one, from Trump, himself, \"I will be a dictator but only for a short time\" should give all Americans reason to carefully consider who steers Good Ship America in the upcoming four years.\nWe do not have to rely on what other people say about who, or what, Trump is; he, himself, tells everyone that tunes in to national media many opportunities to hear it, directly from his own mouth. Granted, there are many, many other media outlets and pundits that will spin who and what he is, and what he will do for you, if you vote to elect him. However, many of the promises he made during his first presidential run, were never fulfilled, for example:\nI'll build a great wall and Mexico will pay for it. NOPE.\nI'll repeal Obamacare and give you better, cheaper health care, NOPE.\nI'll bring manufacturing back to America, NOPE. Under his watch manufacturing jobs remained relatively flat, until they fell off the cliff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'll grow the economy by 4% per year, NOPE. Actually, his best year was 2018, when the economy grew by 2.9% over the previous year.\nI'll cut taxes for everybody, NOPE. While many, but not all, benefited, marginally, from Trump's tax cuts, the vast majority went to the rich and to corporations, some of them not even American.\nI'll terminate Obama's executive orders on immigration, NOPE. While one program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, (DACA), was challenged in our courts, it remains in effect, yet today. A second program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), never was implemented, so Trump could not terminate it.\nIf you listen to Trump now, he is regurgitating some of the same promises he failed to fulfill during his first term in office, even though he enjoyed Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate for his first two years in office. Which brings me to a word, or two, of caution to those who choose to vote in the upcoming elections.\nBe careful of those who don't keep their promises and be careful of the would-be dictator you vote to elect; you don't always get the kind of dictator you think you will, when you voted, based on what he and his minions tell you, and it is very hard to get rid of dictators.\nWILLIAM C.

I told him before the game, I thought he was a great player. And he showed it tonight.\"\nO'Connor ran for two touchdowns and threw for two, including a 43-yard connection to Diontaye Copper with 2 minutes, 15 seconds remaining Friday night, as the third-seeded Warriors defeated the No. 2 seed Buccaneers, 28-21, in a Class 2A East Region second-round playoff at Andy Schipul Stadium.\nAfter going 1-9 a year ago, Easton is 8-3 and now awaits for the state tournament to be re-seeded for next weekend's state quarterfinals.\n\"We didn't score the whole second half,\" said O'Connor, whose 3-yard touchdown run with 1:17 left in the first half helped Easton to a 21-14 halftime lead. \"They were really stopping us and we were just thinking, 'First down. Next first down.' So we were taking it one play at a time. And when you do that, you put a bunch of good plays together, and you bust one, that really turned the tide.\"\nAfter a scoreless third quarter, Kent Island (7-4) tied the game 4 seconds into the fourth quarter on quarterback Gavan Henry's 1-yard sneak. Spencer Chappell's point-after kick tied the game at 21-all.\nEaston's ensuing possession ended with a fourth-down incompletion. Kent Island punted the next time it had the ball.\nThe Warriors took possession at their 20-yard line with 6:17 remaining. On third-and-11, O'Connor hit Colin Mooney for an 11-yard pick-up and a first down. Five consecutive O'Connor runs set up a third-and-five at the Bucs' 43. O'Connor hit Copper on an out route, then watched his receiver cut toward the middle of the field and outrun everyone into the end zone for a 27-21 lead. Dominic Stanco drilled his fourth straight point after for a 28-21 Easton lead.\n\"You try to stop him running the football and he throws on you,\" Davis said of O'Connor.\nKent Island got the ball back on its 37 with 2:15 left. As the Bucs lined up on first down, Easton called time to make a defensive adjustment. On the next play, Copper intercepted Henry, giving the Warriors the ball at the Kent Island 49 with 2:09 left.\n\"Luckily for us we were able to make one more big play than Kent Island tonight, on both sides of the ball,\" Easton head coach Matt Griffith said. \"Big drive. Drove down and scored with like 2:15 left. And then get a huge pick. Call a timeout to see the formation, made a quick adjustment on our coverage, and, man, played it perfect.\"\nO'Connor picked up two first downs to kill the remaining 2:09, cementing the victory.\n\"They came through when they needed to and that was at the most important time,\" O'Connor said of his offensive line. \"When we got those first downs, it was all them. Like I didn't get touched literally until I had the first down.\"\nEaston took a 7-0 lead, when O'Connor busted loose around right end for a 41-yard touchdown just over 2 minutes into the game. Stanco added the PAT.\nKent Island fumbled on its first play of the game, giving Easton the ball on the Bucs 45. The Warriors drove to the Bucs' 13, setting up Stanco's 30-yard field goal attempt that drifted wide right.\nHenry's 1-yard sneak and Chappell's extra-point tied the game at 7-7 with 32 seconds left in the first quarter.\nThe Warriors moved back ahead with 8:50 to go in the second quarter, when O'Connor hit Mooney with a 23-yard touchdown pass in the left, front corner of end zone for a 14-7 lead.\nThe Bucs again pulled even, as Nate Green was sprung for an 11-yard touchdown run with 2:26 to go before halftime.\nEaston responded. Dustin Blue broke free on a 50-yard run on his first carry. O'Connor carried for 12 yards and then raced around left end and squeezed down the sideline for the go-ahead touchdown and a 21-14 halftime lead. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Heartbeat of Easton Utilities' legacy lives on\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHN ENGLEHART | Section: Columns \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Jan. 13, Vicki Petro retired as vice president of human resources at Easton Utilities after 31 years of dedicated service. To some, this may seem like the closing chapter of just another HR career. But to those of us who had the privilege of calling Vicki a colleague, a mentor or a friend, this marks the end of an extraordinary era in the Mid-Shore community.Vicki began her journey with Easton Utilities on Nov. 2, 1993, as the organization's sole HR professional, reporting to the business manager. Over the past three decades, she has shaped the careers of countless employees, directly overseeing the hiring of 324 individuals during her tenure, guiding many through the retirement process and supporting the training and development of many more.\nShe's ensured payroll ran seamlessly more than 750 times, served as a trusted adviser to two CEOs and been the go-to resource for employees seeking guidance to navigate their careers. She has served as mentor to many at Easton Utilities and in the Mid-Shore community, having a profound impact on them both professionally and personally.\nI first met Vicki in 2021 when I interviewed for a position with another organization. She had been invited to serve on the interview panel to lend her expertise and help them make an informed decision. From the moment she spoke, I was struck by her professionalism, warmth and rare passion for HR — a field where such genuine excitement can sometimes feel scarce.\nI remember thinking, If I ever have the chance to work for her, I'll take it, because there's so much I could learn from someone like her. That opportunity came in 2023, and over the past two years, I've grown immensely—not just as an HR professional, but also as a leader and as a person—thanks to her guidance.\nEaston Utilities, like any organization, can be thought of as a living body. The linemen could be viewed as the muscles, the water/wastewater operators perhaps viewed as the backbone, the customer service representatives perhaps the face, and—if you ask the engineers, they might claim to be the brain. But at its core, Human Resources is the heart. It keeps the organization alive and thriving, circulating energy and support to every part.\nFor 30 years, Vicki was Easton Utilities' heartbeat, sustaining the organization through storms, challenges, and triumphs alike.\nHer impact reaches far beyond Easton Utilities' walls. If a gas technician safely resolved a leak in your home, it's likely Vicki played a role in hiring them. If a Velocity technician helped you as a rural customers get connected to much needed high speed internet, chances are Vicki was there to interview them. When linemen braved ice storms to restore power to your neighborhood, she likely contributed to their onboarding. And when you've interacted with our professional and compassionate customer service staff, you've experienced the result of Vicki's discerning eye for talent.\nIn sum, if you've been impressed with Easton Utilities' service over the past 30 years, it's because Vicki had a hand in it — not only by selecting individuals who embody Easton Utilities core values but also by shaping the training that helped them excel. She has also been a great mentor to others through her Leadership Maryland classmates, impacting professionals around the State of Maryland.\nVicki's influence wasn't confined to hiring or compliance—it was deeply human. She understood that when employees face challenges, they carry those burdens home to their families. Time and again, she offered them support, showing them how to navigate their struggles so they could be present for their loved ones.\nAs her retirement approached, Vicki demonstrated the same grace and foresight that defined her career. This graceful departure reminds me of a lesson from sports. As a Baltimore football fan, I think of the legendary Johnny Unitas. He was the greatest quarterback of all time, but even he struggled to hang up his cleats. In a twist few like to remember, Unitas ended his career not in Baltimore but in a San Diego Chargers uniform, a move that seemed out of place for such an icon. It's a lesson in knowing when it's time to step aside. Vicki, however, has shown impeccable timing. She embraced the evolving needs of the organization, mentored her successors, and made way for the next chapter—all while ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong. Some leaders struggle to step aside, holding onto their roles even as the times and needs of their organizations evolve. But not Vicki. She embraced the opportunity to mentor and prepare the next generation, ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong long after she steps away.\nOne of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. A memorable quote from that movie is Harvey Dent's reflection on heroes: \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" In my years of observing HR leaders, I've seen this sentiment play out. Many HR Directors depart their roles amid controversy or burnout, others retiring from their organization leaving behind employees that are happy to see them go rather than admiration. But Vicki defied that trend. She is retiring on her own terms, as a universally respected leader—beloved by employees, admired by executives, and deeply respected throughout the mid-shore community.\nAfter Jan. 13, as the days, weeks, months and years go by, Vicki's name will be heard less and less around Talbot County and Easton Utilities. New employees will join, and those who knew her best will retire. The stories of the great things she achieved as the heart of Easton Utilities will fade, as the stories of legends often do. But I can guarantee her name will be spoken one more time, 20 years from now …\nWhen my time comes to retire, and I am the \"old-school\" HR director trying to understand the up-and-coming HR leaders looking to replace me, I'm sure I will observe them make some kind of mistake — fall flat on their face in a way that only experience can teach to avoid. And just like Vicki, I'll be there with some kind of sage advice to help them learn from it. When they ask me, \"Who taught you that?\" my answer will be simple: \"Vicki Petro taught me that.\"\nAnd with that the legend of Vicki Petro will continue.\nNo one asked or paid me to write this. I did so because some contributions deserve recognition, and Vicki's story is one of them. Over the past two years, I've had the honor of working with her and witnessing her remarkable leadership firsthand. Vicki has been an exceptional HR professional, a trusted advisor, a compassionate mentor, and an inspiring leader. She has not only shaped Easton Utilities but has left it stronger and better for the next generation in our mid-shore community.\nFor now, Vicki rides off into the sunset to begin the next chapter of a legendary life — as a grandma spending time with her grandbabies, traveling with her husband to new places across the globe and enjoying the fruits of her labor. And I'm sure in those new adventures, she will be the heartbeat of those moments, just as she has been the heartbeat for so many years at Easton Utilities and the Mid-Shore community.\nEnjoy your grandbabies, Vicki. Thank you for everything. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Some town councilmembers raised concerns over Lesher simultaneously serving on the County Council and utilities commission.\nTown officials said the legality of serving on both bodies would depend on if the utilities commission is considered a \"trust and profit\" office, since state law doesn't allow someone to hold two such positions.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said at the March 3 meeting that while the town \"would probably get to the conclusion that it is not a second office of trust and profit,\" it would be best to first review case law and attorney general rulings.\nThe appointment was made to fill the role of current commission member Buck Duncan. His time expires this May, leaving ample time for a new appointment, the mayor said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The artists got up one by one to show off their hand-made jewelry, woodworking and pottery.\nOne of the members created something she calls the \"baconator\" which is a ceramic bacon cooker that collects the grease at the bottom. She created two cylinders to hold the bacon so that it can fit a whole pound.\nThe artists also chatted about topics outside of art. Wednesday Morning Artists encouraged member Bill Pavin before he was to speak in front of elected officials in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the funding of research of rare diseases to continue.\nMembers went over logistics, enjoyed their coffee and pet the incredibly cute and fluffy Basil, Robert Gladney's mastiff, as they walked out the door.\nRead the story and others here.

Cambridge Indivisible founder and chair Michelle Fowle said, \"Harris' constituents just want answers.\" She wanted a town hall with the congressman. It's hard even imaging that horror show.Why would anyone subject themself to the shouting and abuse from such a meeting? We have already seen these same embarrassing displays on TV before. Another protester Ms. Frost said that she was concerned that Harris' agenda was more aligned with DOGE than with his constituents.\nNews Flash. Mr Harris was elected by the constituents who voted for him, not against him. Obama once said, \"Elections have consequences.\"\nI'm assuming the group looking to elect progressive leaders missed that message from Barack Obama himself. Harris' agenda is rightfully aligned with the party that won the election just as it should be. His true constituents are quite happy with Congressman Harris right now.\nMaybe this Cambridge group should contact Bernie Sanders for a town hall since his socialist agenda seems much more in line with theirs.\nRICH ADRIAN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Juvenile crime, reform are top issues for Talbot County police\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Talbot County is seeing increases in juvenile crime, along with upticks in petty thefts and some violent crimes, according to the county's top law enforcement officials.Updates on local crime trends from each law enforcement agency in the county dominated discussion at Talbot County's latest Police Accountability Board meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 14.Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble reported a 19% increase in calls for service and a 13% increase in reported crime handled by the sheriff's office, including some small increases in assaults and drug charges. Crimes relating to fraud of older residents are likely the biggest financial loss in the county, he added.Gamble identified juvenile crimes in schools as a particular issue for the sheriff's office, which has uniformed officers serving in most of the public schools.Recently implemented state juvenile justice reform laws have barred police from charging anyone under 13 with most crimes.Gamble said Easton High School and Easton Middle School are where police see most of the incidents involving children, and over 30% of this year's reported incidents involve children under 13.\"We have 12-year-olds that are punching other kids in the face time and time again in the schools, or assaulting other kids, and there's no services for them,\" he said.Police Accountability Board members acknowledged the concerns, asking what officers can do to better handle issues with youth under 13 and if police can work with the schools.Gamble said the school system doesn't have leverage to handle discipline other than resorting to suspensions.Looking forward, Gamble hopes to see movement within state leadership in Annapolis during the upcoming General Assembly session to push legislation to tackle issues with the juvenile reform laws.Outside of juvenile crime, those at the meeting discussed several recent local incidents.In Easton, two homicides occurred within town limits in the last few months - one on Blake Street in early August and a second at the Sidetracked Saloon in late September.Several thefts and robberies have also occurred in town, said Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey. Those include a series of burglaries at vape stores where individuals are seeking Delta-8 THC cartridges, a non-regulated and legal psychoactive substance with effects similar to recreational cannabis.Another issue of great concern to Easton residents is crime on the Rails to Trails pathways throughout town, Lowrey said, citing a serious assault on the trails in the summer.To alleviate those concerns, the town's police department is increasing patrols on the trails and issuing more citations, Lowrey said. Those efforts include repopulating the department's bike unit, which is down due to lower staffing levels.In St. Michaels, Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald didn't note any specific crime trends, though he did mention two car thefts, which are \"extremely unusual\" for the town, he said. The town's tourist season is coming to a close, which means St. Michaels will have a lower population and more shops closed up for the winter.The small St. Michaels Police Department is down a few officers, though two new officers are starting soon, Oswald said. The department was also able to secure higher starting salaries and increases for current officers.\"Things are looking up. It's just going to be a little while,\" he said.Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner did not report any major issues, adding that Oxford is a \"very safe little town.\" The town's three-member police department was fully staffed until a few weeks ago, but Oxford's town commissioners recently agreed to increase the department to four full-time officers, Kellner said. The town is now looking to hire one additional officer. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMembers of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, seated to the right, listen to the county's top law enforcement officials during a Nov. 14 meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Vision from the beginning': BAAM leaders excited for new academic center\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The tall, welcoming windows in the classrooms of Building African American Minds Inc.'s new academic center in Easton don't just bring in sunlight. They connect the surrounding residents to new opportunities.Three stories high and nearly 25,000 square feet, the center will house classes, tutoring, youth programs, community gatherings and more. It sits on Jowite Street, next to the BAAM Athletic Center and across from a large residential area.\nJames Bell, director of instruction, academic support and community wellbeing for the nonprofit, believes the space fits within the organization's mission of creating an educational and social space for underserved children in the area.\n\"The excitement really is looking out of the windows and seeing the potential,\" Bell says. \"So when you see the community, out of every window here in the facility, it lets you know that it's an opportunity for them as well.\"\nSaturday, Building African American Minds will cut the ribbon on the academic center, which is expected to be up and running in January. The center will allow the nonprofit to significantly expand how many children it serves in after-school and summer enrichment programs.\nThere is a library, media center and multipurpose dining room on the first floor. Above are eight classrooms, as well as speciality rooms for esports, art and music.\nClassrooms are designed with desks situated for full-group, small-group and individual learning.\nDina Daly, executive director of Building African American Minds, pointed out a wellness wing, which will be a private space for health, counseling and more. She added that BAAM's sister agency, private school Polaris Village Academy, will operate out of the academic center in 2025.\nWhile the organization's focus has been serving under-resourced youth in the nearby neighborhoods, its reach isn't limited to children or Talbot County residents, Daly says.\nAdult workforce programs will be hosted in the new academic center during the day. On the third floor, Chesapeake College will begin hosting GED and English second language classes in February.\n\"We had a vision from the beginning,\" Daly said. \"So we're just following up on our vision for what we thought needed to happen, not just for the youth.\"\nIn its 20th year, Building African American Minds has long hoped for an academic center like the one that sits on Jowite Street today. Its previous hub, the athletic center next to the new building, isn't going anywhere either.\nHowever, the new academic center was about a $10 million project, Daly said, more than double what the athletic center cost. Private donors, community donations, and state and federal funding made it possible.\n\"We build for the future,\" Daly said. \"From the inception of BAAM, we always talked about building a school and academic center. It's more than a school now. It's more like a community center, really.\"\nDaly said it's been a long process, but she knows the wait was worth it. Starting small and meeting a select group's needs instead of going too broad, such as when the organization began as a boys-only nonprofit in 2005, was the path to success.\nReflecting on the fact that a 20-year goal is finally coming to fruition, Daly hopes the journey of Building African American Minds can inspire others to start small and dream big.\n\"That's why I tell people, 'don't give up on your dreams,'\" Daly said. \"Make smaller goals, make them achievable, and then just keep building it up. And look at what we've accomplished.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate — Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel . The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas's 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Popular CoQ10 Pills Leave Millions Suffering - Could this newly-discovered brain fuel solve America's worsening memory crisis?\n\n September 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A12 | Section: News \n \n 1016\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Millions of Americans take the supplement known as CoQ10. It's the coenzyme that supercharges the \"energy factories\" in your cells known as mitochondria. But there's a serious flaw that's leaving millions unsatisfied.As you age, your mitochondria break down and fail to produce energy. In a revealing study, a team of researchers showed that 95 percent of the mitochondria in a 90-year-old man were damaged, compared to almost no damage in the mitochondria of a 5-year-old.Taking CoQ10 alone is not enough to solve this problem. Because as powerful as CoQ10 is, there's one critical thing it fails to do: it can't create new mitochondria to replace the ones you lost.And that's bad news for Americans all over the country. The loss of cellular energy is a problem for the memory concerns people face as they get older.\"We had no way of replacing lost mitochondria until a recent discovery changed everything,\" says Dr. Al Sears, founder and medical director of the Sears Institute for Anti-Aging Medicine in Palm Beach, Florida. \"Researchers discovered the only nutrient known to modern science that has the power to trigger the growth of new mitochondria.\" Why Taking CoQ10 is Not EnoughDr. Sears explains, \"This new discovery is so powerful, it can multiply your mitochondria by 55 percent in just a few weeks. That's the equivalent of restoring decades of lost brain power.\" This exciting nutrient - called PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) - is the driving force behind a revolution in aging. When paired with CoQ10, this dynamic duo has the power to reverse the age-related memory losses you may have thought were beyond your control.Dr. Sears pioneered a new formula - called Ultra Accel II - that combines both CoQ10 and PQQ to support maximum cellular energy and the normal growth of new mitochondria. Ultra Accel II is the first of its kind to address both problems and is already creating huge demand.Over 47 million doses have been shipped to men and women across the country and sales continue to climb for this much sought-after brain fuel. In fact, demand has been so overwhelming that inventories repeatedly sell out. But a closer look at Ultra Accel II reveals there are good reasons why sales are booming.Science Confirms the Many Benefits of PQQThe medical journal Biochemical Pharmacology reports that PQQ is up to 5,000 times more efficient in sustaining energy production than common antioxidants. With the ability to keep every cell in your body operating at full strength, Ultra Accel II delivers more than just added brain power and a faster memory.People feel more energetic, more alert, and don't need naps in the afternoon. The boost in cellular energy generates more power to your heart, lungs, muscles, and more.\"With the PQQ in Ultra Accel, I have energy I never thought possible at my age,\" says Colleen R., one of Dr. Sears's patients. \"I'm in my 70s but feel 40 again. I think clearly, move with real energy and sleep like a baby.\" The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and Dr. Sears receives countless emails from his patients and readers. \"My patients tell me they feel better than they have in years. This is ideal for people who are feeling old and run down, or for those who feel more forgetful. It surprises many that you can add healthy and productive years to your life simply by taking Ultra Accel II every day.\" You may have seen Dr. Sears on television or read one of his 12 best-selling books. Or you may have seen him speak at the 2016 WPBF 25 Health and Wellness Festival in South Florida, featuring Dr. Oz and special guest Suzanne Somers.Thousands of people attended Dr. Sears's lecture on anti-aging breakthroughs and waited in line for hours during his book signing at the event.Will Ultra Accel II Multiply Your Energy?Ultra Accel II is turning everything we thought we knew about youthful energy on its head.Especially for people over age 50. In less than 30 seconds every morning, you can harness the power of this breakthrough discovery to restore peak energy and your \"spark for life.\" So, if you've noticed less energy as you've gotten older, and you want an easy way to reclaim your youthful edge, this new opportunity will feel like blessed relief.The secret is the \"energy multiplying\" molecule that activates a dormant gene in your body that declines with age, which then instructs your cells to pump out fresh energy from the inside-out. This growth of new \"energy factories\" in your cells is called mitochondrial biogenesis.Instead of falling victim to that afternoon slump, you enjoy sharp-as-a-tack focus, memory, and concentration from sunup to sundown. And you get more done in a day than most do in a week. Regardless of how exhausting the world is now.Dr. Sears reports, \"The most rewarding aspect of practicing medicine is watching my patients get the joy back in their lives. Ultra Accel II sends a wake-up call to every cell in their bodies And they actually feel young again.\" And his patients agree. \"I noticed a difference within a few days,\" says Jerry from Ft. Pierce, Florida. \"My endurance has almost doubled, and I feel it mentally, too. There's a clarity and sense of well-being in my life that I've never experienced before.\" How To Get Ultra Accel IIThis is the official nationwide release of Ultra Accel II in the United States. And so, the company is offering a special discount supply to anyone who calls during the official launch.An Order Hotline has been set up for local readers to call. This gives everyone an equal chance to try Ultra Accel II. And your order is backed up by a no-hassle, 90-day money back guarantee.

Unfortunately, this \"new\" resolution is nothing more than a repackaging of the same resolutions we have watched the county wrestle with for more than a year with no outcome in sight.Changing a few numbers and giving it a new title does not in any way change the obvious intent of all this legislation, which is to keep the Lakeside development under the control of a minority group with their own agenda. What that agenda is has been unclear but obviously their intent is to drag out the process in any way they can to buy time for more interference.\nA recent letter to the Star Democrat went so far as to imply that the Town of Trappe needs to be ready to build schools for the new students from Lakeside. Since when did small towns begin building and paying for their own schools? Isn't that a county function? I thought that's what we pay county taxes for?\nThe implication was that citizens in Talbot County shouldn't have to educate Trappe children. Does that mean Trappe taxpayers shouldn't pay for schools in other parts of the county? That is not how government works. What next? Does Trappe need to build it's own hospital?\nI have paid county taxes for the 25 years since retiring here. I would like to know what my taxes go for. I see many expenditures approved at County Council meetings using funds that include my taxes. Why should I feel guilty when I expect to be treated like any other county citizen?\nThe Lakeside development is simply Trappe's attempt to make up for years of lackluster or nonexistent growth so that our town can enjoy a tax base that can provide the funding needed to function as a modern, financially stable municipality. The county also will benefit in the long run with additional residential and commercial taxes, more housing for county residents, not to mention jobs to reduce unemployment in the area.\nWhy doesn't anyone want to look at the positives of a planned development instead of focusing on the negatives? This whole situation has dragged out long enough and doesn't need new legislative smoke and mirrors in an attempt to drag it further. All of this waste of time and resources is an unnecessary cost we should not be forced to bear.\nAnd on a final note, I really want to express my disbelief that Mr. Lesher and Ms. Melkie would insult the intelligence of their constituents by their attempt to blatantly force their old legislation through as something new, just by making such a minute change, which will only add one to three years more to an already time-consuming process.\nMICHAEL SULLIVAN\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate – Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel. The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas' 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gov. Wes Moore, a friend of Maryland newspapers\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Wes Moore recently vetoed a Maryland House bill that would have been crippling to state newspapers.\"There is also a vital public interest in ensuring the existence of thriving independent local media,\" Moore wrote in his veto letter. \"In fact, democracy can not function effectively in the absence of a free press that provides objective information to the citizenry about crucial events in government and in our communities.\"\nThe legislation, House Bill 1258, would have taken public notices regarding estate administration, currently published in newspapers, and allowed them to be posted on a state-operated website. The cost to state newspapers was estimated at $1.7 million. If the legislation had taken effect Oct. 1, there is no doubt that by the dawn of the new year would have seen significantly fewer newspaper journalists working in Maryland.\nIn his veto letter, Moore noted public notice advertising \"have helped sustain much of the local print media in Maryland' as advertising dollars have dried up and the media industry has consolidated and downsized.\nMoore had some tough words for the newspaper industry, whose lobbying group did not engage in hearings, testimony or conversations about the bill. That was a serious oversight by the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association, an oversight that could have had disastrous effects on the newspapers that pay dues for the association to represent them in legislative discussions. Moore, without a doubt, bailed out newspapers with his veto.\nSticking on the theme of state politics, the race to replace U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin started hot and continues to sizzle. Democrat Cardin decided not to seek reelection, which set off a ferocious primary battle between Congressman David Throne and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. Despite being outspent 9-1 by Trone who dumped tens of millions of his own money into his campaign, Alsobrooks easily won the nomination.\nAlsobrooks will face former Gov. Larry Hogan in November. Hogan is hoping to appeal to Democrats to cross over and vote for him as they did when he was elected governor. Hogan started the morning after the primary, releasing a video showing prominent Democrats praising him during his days when he was governor. The video featured clips of Wes Moore, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and even Angela Alsobrooks. The message: Hogan has a history of working across the aisle with Democrats.\nThat message was on display last week when Hogan visited Cambridge where he picked up a couple of endorsements from Dorchester County Councilman Ricky Travers, a Democrat, and County Council Vice President Mike Detmer, a Republican.\n\"This is especially nice because it's a bipartisan thing,\" Hogan told Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato. \"I've always been somebody that reaches across the aisle and tries to find consensus and tries to get things done with Republicans and Democrats working together.\"\nFor Travers, it's not about Democrat or Republican when it comes to the Senate seat.\n\"It's about who's the best person for the job,\" he said in an interview. \"That's the bottom line.\"\nHogan drew fire from his own party after he posted on Twitter prior to a New York jury finding former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign to cover up an affair with adult film actress, Stormy Daniels.\n\"Regardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"… We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\"\nThat drew criticism from Republicans.\n\"You just ended your campaign,\" Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, responded minutes later.\nBuckle your seatbelts, we are in for a wild ride with this campaign.\nCongratulations to Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe who became a grandmother on March 17 with the birth of Declan James Alexander Haythe. Declan is the son of Marcus Leandre Haythe Jr. and Beatrice Anne Gorman. Keasha Haythe beams when she talks about her grandson.\nJim Johnson is the executive editor of the Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jeff Ghrist introduced legislation Feb. 9 aimed at giving local jurisdictions the authority to regulate the storage of dissolved air flotation by-products, otherwise known as DAF residuals.\"I want to make sure that the local governing bodies can do that on their own without any ambiguity, because small counties like Caroline … can't afford to be sued,\" Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said in a Feb. 21 interview.\nHouse Bill 1404 was co-sponsored by Del. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) and Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) as well as two Cecil County legislators and three from the western shore. It is cross-filed with Senate Bill 1149, sponsored by Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nGhrist's bill addresses an issue the Caroline County Commissioners have been dealing with in their legislation process since mid-December. He said he discussed the DAF storage issue with the commissioners, the Eastern Shore delegation and the Maryland Farm Bureau.\nNeither the state's Department of the Environment nor the Department of Agriculture have jurisdiction over regulating or controlling the storage of DAF residuals, \"and so we have at least one person taking advantage of that loophole in the law,\" he said.\n\"Whether or not (Love's bill) removes any ambiguity (regarding) how much control the county commissioners have in storage, that remains to be seen,\" Ghrist said. \"But I just want to make sure that after this legislation is passed that one, it goes far enough to ensure that we're not going to have DAF being stored anywhere near our towns, and two, if it doesn't go far enough, I want to make sure that the local governing bodies can (restrict it) on their own, without any ambiguity.\"\nGhrist said he wanted to make sure that the case would have no standing in court if \"anybody decided to sue the county.\"\nThe bill is \"just a placeholder,\" Ghrist said. If a separate bill, HB991 sponsored by Del. Sara Love (D-Montgomery) addresses the DAF storage issue and is passed, Ghrist said he may consider withdrawing his.\nIf enacted, HB991 would establish an industrial sludge utilization permit administered and enforced by the Department of the Environment.\nGhrist's bill will be considered 1 p.m. March 8 by the Environment and Transportation Committee.\nLove's bill will go to the same committee 1 p.m. March 5.\nFor more information on legislation in the 2024 Maryland General Assembly, visit mgaleg.maryland.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Corn fields, corn cribs and corn recipes\n\n July 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1351\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Riding the country roads throughout the Eastern Shore brings back so many memories of the past.The cornfields of today have not changed — the beautiful green rows of corn stalks slightly moving in the hot breeze. But how these fields were planted and will be harvested has changed.\nThose modern, expensive, air-conditioned tractors with radios make life easier on 90-to-100-degree days. But the farmer's workday is still not easy — exposed to all kinds of environments, no guarantee of a successful harvest, seeds and chemical prices skyrocketing, getting farm workers is almost impossible. Yet that farmer keeps going and praying he has a good crop this year.\nAs we turn onto West Line Road, some of the corn fields are there — not many, but still a few. The memories begin to surface as I see where the barn once stood.\nThis barn housed the cows, and the second floor, known as the hayloft, held the hay. Many funny stories linger in that memory (another column for another day).\nBehind the barn were the hog pens, where a lot of the corn was eaten, and the corn stalks made clean bedding.\nThe corn crib is a slender shed and had a roof, wooden floor, latched door and slatted walls that allowed air and light to help keep the corn from molding. The corn in here had some husks on them, but by fall they had dried. We would peel off the dried husks and throw them onto the ground in the pig pen, then hand shelled the corn into the hog trough.\nIn those days, the older kids watched the younger kids when the parents had to attend events without their children. One day my parents left my older sister to watch us.\nMy sister was an \"undercover smoker.\" We were not allowed to smoke, but she did whenever and wherever no adults were around.\nAs soon as the car pulled out of the driveway, she got her \"smokes\" out and went outside, taking my brother with her, and they proceeded to \"puff.\"\nSuddenly my parents' car pulled in the driveway. Apparently, they had forgotten something.\nWell, my brother and sister shoved their lit cigarettes in the slats of the corn crib, which sparked a fire, and smoke soon billowed. My mom came out of the house, smelled smoke, ran in her \"dress clothes\" to get the water turned on for the hose while screaming for my dad to get out and help.\nMy brother never smoked again, but my sister smoked \"undercover\" for many more years.\nA few tips for buying corn at your local produce stands this year:\nDon't buy pre-shucked corn, as it starts getting starchy once the stalk is off.Examine the silk. Older corn silk will look brown/black and dried out. Fresh corn on the cob will have silk that's a lighter color.Look for husks that are bright green, and avoid husks that are brown, bruised or dried-out looking.Hold each ear of corn to find the heavier ones, which are juicier.\nEnjoy today's corn recipes.\nSTEAMED CORN6 ears corn (husked), 2 tbsps granulated sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp salt.\nFill a pot full of water and bring it to boil. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Place the corn into the boiling water. Let the water return to a boil. Once boiling again, cover with a lid and turn off the heat. Cook the corn for 8-10 minutes or until tender.\nSWEET CORN RELISH10 fresh ears of sweet yellow corn (husks and silk removed, slice kernels off the cob with a sharp knife), 2 large red bell peppers (cored and finely chopped), 2 large green bell peppers (cored and finely chopped), 8 ribs celery (finely chopped), 1 large yellow or sweet onion (finely chopped), 4 cups apple cider vinegar, 2 cups sugar, 1 tbsp ground mustard, 3 tsps salt.\nCombine all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Ladle the relish into hot sterilized jars and seal with lids. Process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. Keep stored in a dark, cool place. Will keep at least one year. Once opened, store in the fridge for up to two months. Makes approximately 8 pints. Wait a week or two before eating the relish to allow time for the vinegar to mellow out. Use it on hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fish, serve it with roasted chicken or mix with tomatoes/onions/cilantro for a Summer salad.\nCORN PUDDING RECIPE5 large eggs, ⅓ cup butter (melted and slightly cooled), ¼ cup white sugar, ½ cup milk, ¼ cup cornstarch,1 ½ cups steamed or cooked corn or 1 can of kernel corn, 2 (14.75 ounce) cans cream-style corn.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Whisk eggs lightly in a large bowl. Add milk, melted butter, sugar, and cornstarch; whisk until well combined. Stir in drained corn and cream-style corn until fully blended. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.\nCORN FRITTERS3 cups oil for frying, 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp white sugar, 1 large egg (lightly beaten), ½ cup milk, 1 tbsp shortening (melted), 1 12-ounce can whole kernel corn (drained).\nHeat oil in a heavy pot or deep fryer to 365 degrees. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a medium bowl. Beat egg, milk and melted shortening together in a small bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture. Stir in corn. Working in batches, drop fritter batter by spoonful into the hot oil. Fry until golden. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.\nBARBECUE GRILLED \"CORN RIBS\"BBQ Seasoning Blend: 2 tbsps chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp packed light brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, salt.\nBBQ Sauce: 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup apple cider vinegar,1 /4 cup yellow mustard, 3 tbsps packed light brown sugar, 1/2 tsp hot sauce, salt.\nCorn Ribs: 4 ears corn (shucked), Canola or vegetable oil (for the grill grates), 1 scallion (thinly sliced).\nFor the BBQ seasoning blend: Stir to combine the chili powder, smoked paprika, brown sugar, cayenne pepper and 1 tsp salt in a small bowl.\nFor the BBQ sauce: Whisk together the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, hot sauce, 1 tsp salt and 1 tbsp of the BBQ seasoning blend in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.\nFor the corn ribs: Using a large chef's knife and a large steady cutting board, cut off the ends of the corn cobs to make them flat. Using your hands, break the cobs in half crosswise. Stand a cob on one flat end and carefully and slowly cut down through the core, rocking the knife back and forth if necessary, to split the cob in half lengthwise. Repeat with all the cobs. Lay a split corn cob on its flat side on the cutting board and cut lengthwise through the cob, pressing down and rocking the knife back and forth if necessary, to make 2 long corn ribs. Repeat with the remaining cob halves. (You should have 32 ribs total.) Place on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Sprinkle the corn ribs with 1 tablespoon of the seasoning blend. Brush the ribs with 1/2 cup BBQ sauce. Place the corn, cut-side down, on the grill and close the lid. Cook until the cut edges are beginning to char and caramelize, about 8 minutes. Flip the ribs to the second cut side, close the grill lid and cook until the edges are caramelized and the corn kernels are crisp-tender, another 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the corn to a platter. Brush with more sauce and season with a pinch of the BBQ seasoning blend (reserve the remaining blend for another use). Sprinkle the scallions and serve with the remaining BBQ sauce. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "It's time for Mid-Shore regional planning\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Activate \n \n 588\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) released a new 10-year strategic plan calling for (in their words), a \"sea change,\" to boost economic opportunity in Baltimore city and five Maryland counties adjacent to Baltimore — Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard.Founded in 1955, GBC is a not-for-profit organization with approximately 400 members.\nTheir membership includes large, mid-size and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, foundations, educational providers and health care institutions in the Baltimore region.\nAll the geographic areas served by GBC are unique, but all recognize the value of mutually beneficial collaborative efforts on economic development matters.\nIn an ever-changing world, GBC 's new strategic plan acknowledged a pressing need for changes on a better definition of their traditional purposes and their traditional goals.\nAccordingly, their new plan includes new purposes and new goals to guide private and public investment and regional collaborations designed to result in transformational positive change in the Baltimore region.\nSpecific GBC goals are included in three broad areas of economic development. They are:\nIndustry and innovation.Place and community.Talent and people.\nUltimately, GBC's vision is to position the Baltimore region's residents, businesses and quality of life amenities, as a globally recognizable and competitive brand.\nThe overall success of GBC's new plan is based not only on new purposes and new goals. It also depends upon on a continuing commitment to collaboration from businesses, political leaders, developers, educators, workforce providers, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, current economic development organizations and other key stakeholders in Baltimore City and the five surrounding counties.\nBased on past measurable successes with GBC, they understand they do best by not competing against each other but by working together to compete globally for current and emerging economic engines that provide good jobs, good wages, good benefits and economic stability.\nThey also understand the needs of the leaders such economic engines. These leaders are much less interested in artificial human-made geographic boundaries that delineate county and municipal borders and are much more interested in what a region can provide in terms of a long-term, reliable and positive business environment along with a supply of skilled workers.\nNo doubt any discussion of any changes leading to a new regional approach to economic development for the Mid-Shore region may be unsettling to some. It is new, and it is different.\nI suggest now is the time for the leaders in Talbot, Dorchester and Caroline counties (at a minimum) to immediately engage in meaningful discussions on the feasibility and benefits of launching a Mid-Shore version of a regional economic development organization comparable to the GBC.\nThe key words are comparable to the GBC, not identical to the GBC.\nI am not suggesting Mid-Shore leaders adopt GBC's purposes and goals without modifications that work best for the Mid-Shore now and going forward. I further suggest we already have an outstanding organization in place to serve as a new leader in regional economic development.\nThat organization is Chesapeake College.\nThe college has served the Mid Shore region with distinction since it was chartered as Maryland's first regional community college in 1965 and opened in 1967.\nOffering a wide range of adult learning opportunities, they have extensive experience in developing and conducting workforce-training programs. The availability of these programs is great selling point for economic development prospects.\nI also suggest that in addition to a new regional economic development organizational model, the Mid-Shore must have an open and transparent process for developing regional economic development goals based on citizen input to maintain and advance the Mid-Shore's position in Maryland as the \"Land of Pleasant Living.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Texas tragedy has shown worst of American society\n\n July 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 782\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The recent flash flood tragedy in central Texas resulted in seeing the best and the worst of American society.The best has been an outpouring of sympathy, caring and support for the flood victims, their families and the survivors. There have been countless reports of selfless rescue and recovery efforts by first responders and volunteers, some from well beyond the immediate flooded area.\nThe worst has been numerous messages on social media and other media platforms — e.g., a newspaper editorial cartoon — that were vile, hateful and some of which were vulgar.\nMany of them chose to blame Trump supporters or policy decisions of the Trump administration for this tragedy.\nFar too many did not include expressions of sadness or sympathy for the deaths of innocent children and adults or compassion for the lifelong impact on all the flooding survivors.\nThe level of vitriol in these messages is so offensive, I will not repeat any of them in this column.\nThe only thing they have in common is they are devoid of any sense of decency and civility.\nSomewhat surprising has been dismay and even outrage expressed from unexpected sources over these vile messages.\nNina Turner is a former national co-chair for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.\nShe recently said, \"It takes a serious lack of humanity to see children to be in a politicized discussion and respond something like lines of \"that's what they [voters in Texas] voted for.\"\nTurner's closing one word comment says it all — \"Shameful.\"\nJohn Favreau and Tommy Vietor are co-hosts on the left of center, Pod Save America.\nBoth worked for Barack Obama prior to and during his presidential administration.\nBoth have condemned social media posts that blame local Texans and the Trump administration for all who died as a result of the recent floods.\nFavreau said: \"I think the really gross stuff was, I saw some people be, like, 'Well, Texas, you voted for Trump, and this is what you get.'\"\nFavreau has challenged suggestions that staffing levels at the National Weather Service in Texas had anything to do with the tragedy. Favreau has said, \"It seems like the National Weather Service, like I said, did send out a timely warning, it just didn't get to people. And that's, you know, not the Trump administration saying that; independent meteorologists and experts have all said this.\"\nVietor has said that while questions about the effect of weather services cuts could be \"an important question going forward, I could have done without the, like, instant, you know, leap to blame name-your-political-opponent for this tragedy on Twitter.\"\nThe \"blame your political opponent\" campaign on this tragedy is already well underway.\nShortly after news broke on the flooding, Sen. Chuck Schumer demanded the Commerce Department's inspector general investigate vacancies at National Weather Service offices and whether the purported vacancies resulted in a higher death toll in in Texas.\nSchumer has suggested that proposed but yet-to-be-implemented Trump budget cuts resulted in unfilled weather service positions in Texas were to blame. Sen. Chris Dodd has said likewise.\nSchumer proclaimed: \"The American people deserve answers.\"\nYes, we do, but not from you two or anyone who wants to advance a political agenda from this tragedy.\nWe deserve answers only if the following investigative guidelines are agreed to, in advance of, and are strictly adhered to during every phase of any investigation. At a minimum, the investigation must focus less on assigning blame for what happened or did not happen with regard to timely and effective flash flood alerts.\nThe laser like focus must be on what can be done going forward to help ensure it never happens again.\nDiffering opinions must be welcome and considered provided they follow the timeless observation of former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who once said, \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\"\nOne new previously unreported fact comes from a recent Washington Post article headline — \"Camp Mystic's leader got a 'life threatening' flood alert. They evacuated an hour later.\"\nWe also need to accept that we never have and never will live in a risk-free world.\nWe can only anticipate risks and take prudent steps to try to avoid them or deal with them if and when necessary. Accidents can never be totally avoided despite plans and best intentions.\nGoing forward, we desperately need a renewed universal commitment that when tragedies strike, to make sure social media posts and other public reactions reflect common decency and respect for each and every person impacted in any way by that tragedy.\nThis is especially vital in dealing with those who hold different political party affiliations or different views on a wide range of public policy issues.\nWe must do so if we have any hope of reversing the steadily declining levels of decency and civility in our society. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A steady stream of cars pulled up at the Food Bank's Glasgow warehouse to drop off food donations that were then unloaded by legislators and other volunteers.\nInside, 25 volunteers helped sort and pack food.\n\"Tonight has been so heartwarming to just stand here and watch all the legislators that have come out to support, and all the people that are coming with food,\" Kanefsky said.\nFood banks across the country were left reeling last week when the Trump administration abruptly paused $500 million in funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Food Assistance Program.\nFor the Food Bank of Delaware, from April to June alone, the canceled shipments equate to 750,000 pounds of food or 900,000 meals that would have directly benefited residents across the state.\nState Rep. Eric Morrison, who has been a regular Food Bank volunteer for 20 years, organized Tuesday's food drive.\n\"When I learned that they are going to be losing about 50 percent of their food, everybody felt frustrated and I thought I have to do something. Somebody has to do something,\" Morrison said. \"Tonight, we can bring in a lot of food, but we can also bring in awareness, which is really important.\"\nOne in seven Delawareans, including one in five children, are food insecure, he added.\n\"I think some people may have certain prejudices or misconceptions about who uses the Food Bank, but we're talking about your grandparents, your children, your next door neighbor with a disability. It's a lot of people,\" he said.\nMorrison added that in Dover, there are ongoing discussions about how much the state will have to step in to make up for lost funding to the Food Bank and other programs affected by federal cuts.\n\"It's very hard right now, because with the federal administration, everything is just very day-by-day,\" he said. \"Every day, we're waking up to something new.\"\nResidents can visit fbd.org to learn how they can help the Food Bank.\n\"We're facing some interesting times, and we've all got to take care of each other,\" Morrison said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mental Health experts offer tips for managing New Year's resolutions\n\n January 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The new year is here, and what comes with it, for many people, is a fresh start.New Year's resolutions are infamously tied to failure of goals, but mental health experts share that if people are seeking positive change in their lives, understanding mental health will allow people to not only accomplish their goals but to be kinder to themselves if they are unable to achieve their goals within an expected time frame.\nKatie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications at For All Seasons, said the connection between mental health and New Year's resolutions are heavily tied together.\n\"Mental health is foundational to how we think, feel and act,\" Theeke said. \"When we care for our mental health we feel better, and people will often see their quality of life and relationships improve. Without awareness and care for our mental health, it's very difficult to have the motivation and commitment to fulfill our hopes and goals for the new year.\"\nAccording to Centerstone, a national nonprofit specializing in mental health and substance use disorder, there is an unspoken rule that resolutions should be all or nothing extremities. This mindset it often leads to difficult-to-accomplish resolutions and then ideas of self-sabotage and punishment if resolutions are not accomplished, Centerstone said.\nTheeke said it is great to think of goals, but what is more important is the little steps and systems that are put into place to steer people in the direction they want to go. Instead of focusing on a big goal like losing a significant amount of weight, she encourages people to try to set up a simple system to start getting healthy, such as walking with a friend each week.\nTheeke said it's the small attainable steps that start to build up. If one system doesn't work it's important to evaluate and change the system to something that works better for the individual.\nFor those who want to make resolutions around mental health, Theeke suggests considering activities that bring positive emotions, whether it be music, walking, exercising, feeding and watching birds, or spending time with friends and family. Prioritizing simple acts of joy, even if it requires carving time out to do so, can have big gains in mental health growth, she said.\nFor those who find themselves continuing to feel low for more than two weeks at a time, Theeke suggests considering reaching out to a mental health professional. Individuals need to take the time to invest in themselves and investing in mental health can have lasting gains.\nBut most importantly, Theeke encourages everyone to be kind to themselves regardless of success on their resolutions. If people are able to approach themselves with more kindness and understanding, it can help build the confidence needed to accomplish whatever goals that are made. But most importantly, kindness for self can make moving forward with everyday life easier and improve personal relationships.\n\"One of the nicest things you can do for yourself in the new year is change your internal dialogue,\" Theeke said. \"So many of us are criticizing ourselves throughout the day. Catch yourself if you are thinking something negative and try out some simple phrases like, 'I am focusing on progress, not perfection.' Or, 'I am getting a little stronger and healthier every day.' There are so many positive affirmations out there. Find a few that feel right for you and try them. Reach out to a trusted friend or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle. There are good people out there who are ready to help.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Young author presents local bird guide to Horizons students\n\n July 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Encouraging fellow youths to learn about their local feathered friends, Xaviana Leis, 13, of Edgewater presented her authored and illustrated \"Maryland Bird Guide\" to Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's students at the Gunston School June 25.Preventing summer learning from going to the birds, this season's Horizons summer program focus is all about birds with high-flying fun. Last week's presenter, Leis shared her knowledge about birds and her experiences as a raptor volunteer and what others can do to support their environment.\nHorizons of Kent and Queen Anne's programs seek to prevent \"summer slide\" and provide engaging educational opportunities and events for under-resourced students, according to Emily Murphy, executive director.\nThis season's theme focuses all on birds and in addition to regular Horizons activities, this summer students are diving into what it means to be a good steward of the environment and strengthen an appreciation for wildlife, Murphy said.\nThroughout the summer the students will engage in high-flying activities including bird watching and building an osprey nest, Murphy said.\nIn keeping with this season's theme, Horizons was excited to welcome Leis, who at the age of 11, authored and illustrated her book \"Maryland Bird Guide\".\nA homeschool student in Edgewater and member of Girl Scout 11023, her passion for birds grew when a rehabilitator with Owl Moon Raptor Center came to present to her troop, she said.\nSoon, Leis was volunteering herself at Owl Moon along with her mother, and was captivated by the world of local birds, she said.\nWriting and illustrating the self-published \"Maryland Bird Guide\" as part of a Girl Scout Bronze Star Award when she was 11, Leis seeks to continually educate her community on the wonders of local birds and spread messages about how to help these amazing creatures.\n\"I wanted to do something that would inspire others to learn more about birds and how they can help them,\" she said.\nSome species of birds like crows are extremely intelligent and can remember the actions of humans that are nice to them and those who aren't so nice, Leis said. Crows also use human tools to their advantage, such as leaving nuts in the road to be cracked by passing cars and then hopping into the road when the traffic light turns red.\nContrary to popular belief, bread is not a suitable food to feed ducks at the park, Leis said.\nBread has little nutritional value for ducks and uneaten bread can also form algae to gunk up the water. Better foods available in your kitchen to toss for ducks include fruit, uncooked oatmeal and rice. Frozen peas thawed by the time you get to the park also make a nice treat, she said.\nLeis also noted the impressive wingspan on several species of raptors that truly has to be seen to be believed.\nShe reiterated the importance of cleaning up litter for the benefit of keeping a natural habitat beautiful for all of us.\nAlso part of her Scout project, Leis built special tubes to properly dispose of discarded fishing line so it does not get tangled in unsuspecting wildlife.\nEveryone can do their part in helping wildlife this summer by picking up trash, including fishing line and disposing of it in proper receptacles.\nGoing into eighth grade this fall, her goal is to continually educate her community about wildlife.\nBirds are more than just pretty things to look at out your window, they are living creatures and helping birds thrive is a necessary part of the functioning ecosystem, Leis said. \"They are part of the environment and we need to help them.\"\n\"Maryland Guide to Birds\" includes over fifty different birds common to Maryland and nearby states alongside vibrant watercolor illustrations by Leis herself. The book contains a wingspan's worth of information including habitats, diet, size, and fun facts.\n\"You have the ability to make a difference even if you're younger. I want to show others they can have a cause they believe in,\" she said.\nReceiving signed copies of the bird guide, Horizons students were encouraged to \"go wild\" and use the book through the summer program to help identify local birds in the area.\nLeis self-published book is available on Amazon and all proceeds go toward Owl Moon. To date, Leis has raised over $10,000.\n\"It just feels incredible,\" she said.\nFree copies of \"Maryland Guide to Birds\" for groups are available by messaging the Girls Making The World A Better Place Facebook page, Dombi-Leis said.\nHorizons seeks to provide additional support and summer enrichment opportunities to underprivileged students.\nMore information about Horizons can be found at https://horizonskentqueenannes.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This time, they decided to answer.\"The gentleman said, 'I'm from animal control, and I have your cat, Butters,'\" Angelo Castellino said.\"I go, 'Is this some sort of punk call?'\" The Castellinos soon discovered it was not a scam - it was Riverside County Animal Control Officer Dalton Churchwell in California, who had found Butters in his yard late at night on Sunday, Oct. 3, and scanned him for a microchip.The couple had been living in San Diego and reported Butters missing 12 years ago in 2011. They had since moved to Stanwood in 2014 and lost hope of ever seeing the cat again.Luckily, the phone number attached to the microchip is the same one Shelley Castellino has today.\"I was astonished, it was kind of unbelievable,\" Angelo Castellino said.\"We figured that he was a meal for some coyotes.\" Angelo Castellino said he's unsure how Butters traveled so far, but that he was always trying to explore. The couple had adopted Butters and his brother, Barnacles, from a shelter in San Diego as kittens.After the news was shared, the Castellinos knew they wanted to bring Butters to their new home in Stanwood, but the expenses and logistics of flying a cat from California to Washington made for a tricky situation.The Animal Solutions Konnection Foundation, a California non-profit organization supporting the Department of Animal Services, soon heard the story.The organization decided to fund the cost of a flight to Seattle to see Butters safely return to his family.\"We were thrilled to work with the Department of Animal Services to make this reunion possible,\" said Carolyn Badger, president of the ASK Foundation, in a news release from Riverside County Animal Control.\"It was such a wonderful story, and we are very happy to know that Butters is home and safe with his family,\" she said.Butters' unlikely reunion finally happened Oct. 7, when Riverside County Department of Animal Services' longtime volunteer Larry Rudolph delivered Butters to the Castellanos in Seattle.Butters is now settled in his Stanwood home, and lives happily beside his brother, Barnacles, and the Castellinos' two dogs, Roscoe and Alita.Riverside Animal Services said Butters' defying of the odds was a testament to dedication and teamwork - but also a reminder to microchip pets to ensure reunification. \n \n Caption: ISABELLA LOY/STANWOOD CAMANO NEWS\n \nButters relaxes after his 12-year adventure.\n \nISABELLALOY/STANWOOD CAMA NO NEWS\n \nButters sits in the lap of Angelo Castallino. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is a mixed-income housing project on a 2.36-acre lot at 410 Needwood Avenue, within the East End area that the town is aiming to revitalize.\nAn updated site plan was presented at Thursday's Planning Commission meeting, along with a traffic study that was requested when developers weren't granted approval last month. The project is set to include 16 three-story townhomes and 12 two-story townhomes.\nThe 10 grain bins currently on the lot, often referred to by community members as silos, would be demolished.\nResidents that live near the site spoke during public comment on Thursday, largely in opposition to the design of the townhomes. Developers have stated the architecture is intended to \"pay homage\" to the Perdue site and fit in the surrounding industrial area.\n\"This is the core of Easton,\" resident Tom Ledvina said. \"The code and the (comprehensive) plan say it has to look, it has to be compatible with that historic look that makes Easton special. And this just doesn't.\"\nZach Smith, an attorney representing the developers, asked that the commission look toward the town staff's review and analysis of the project, which noted it does fit within Easton's comprehensive plan.\n\"We don't have to get the consensus of the neighbors in order to move forward,\" Smith said. \"What we have to do is to comply with the town's requirements.\"\nResident Maury Schlesinger spoke in disapproval of how the project faces inward toward the parking lot, with its back to the street. He said it will be \"distinct\" and \"separate\" compared to the nearby residential designs.\n\"Is this how we want our economically challenged people to live?\" Schlesinger asked the commission. \"Is this how we build an inclusive community? And is the desire to approve more housing right now so great that concern for (developers') budgets and timetable overcomes the need to protect the character of the town?\n\"I'm all for affordable housing, but it shouldn't look like this.\"\nCOMMISSION SPLITCommission members Victoria McAndrews and William Ryall, who were not present at the September meeting, expressed their own concerns about the project. McAndrews and fellow member Thomas Klein said they didn't like the design.\n\"This to me, has an incredibly suburban subdivision feel, as opposed to being an integrated part of the neighborhood,\" McAndrews said. \"And I'm just wondering what is the rationale for not following the existing framework of how the neighborhood is laid out.\"\nCommission Chairperson Philip Toussaint and Vice Chairperson Michael Ports complimented the design of the townhomes and pushed for approval.\nSmith did the same, noting that developers fulfilled the requests made by the commission last month to include a traffic study — which revealed no significant impacts — and remove a section of fencing.\n\"We left this meeting last month with a clear direction that we needed to address the fence and we needed … a traffic study,\" Smith said. \"We've done both of those things, and now we're at a point where we're facing having to come back yet again. This is how workforce housing projects die.\"\nRyall, who said he liked the design but was \"torn\" over whether it fit within the surrounding residential area, joined Toussaint and Ports in supporting approval.\n\"I don't want to let perfection get in the way of the good,\" Ryall said. \"So I'm willing to vote in favor of it.\"\nPorts moved for approval, seconded by Toussaint. All members voted yes, though McAndrews and Klein did so reluctantly, emphasizing their disagreement with the design.\nSince the proposal came in the town's planned redevelopment overlay district, it will not require approval from the Easton Town Council. Thursday's vote was passed on the conditions that developers make minor adjustments to the site plan and approval is granted by town staff. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "After deadly work zone crashes, a push for change\n\n April 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 631\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — After a pair of deadly work zone incidents cast attention on the dangers of road work, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore enacted a set of protections for workers and their families that his administration describes as \"a moral imperative.\"Hours after the state's legislature adjourned, a bill increasing fines for work zone speed violations and another covering educational costs for families of fallen workers were among the first measures from the 2024 session that Moore signed into law.\nAt a bill signing ceremony, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, a former transportation engineer, invoked two fatal crashes that inspired the new legislation. In March 2023, six highway workers died when a car careened into a work zone on Interstate 695. Nearly a year later, six construction workers repairing potholes atop the Francis Scott Key Bridge were killed when a container ship struck the bridge, causing it to collapse.\n\"The men and women in the construction industry place themselves in harm's way every day on the frontline of service,\" Miller said. \"We saw it happen on March 22, 2023. And we saw it happen again on March 26, 2024. It's a moral imperative that we protect workers who provide critical service, public service for all of us.\"\nAmong the measures to receive Moore's signature was the Maryland Road Worker Protection Act, which Miller championed throughout the legislative session and touted Tuesday, during an event overlooking the site of the I-695 crash to mark National Work Zone Awareness Week.\nEffective June 1, the new law permits the installation of multiple speed cameras within a single work zone and raises the fine for speed camera violations to $80. The current penalty in Maryland is $40, among the lowest such fines in the country.\nBeginning January 2025, fines shift to a tiered system ranging from $60 to $500 depending on the driver's speed. Fines will double if workers are present at the time of the violation.\nThe new law is part of a larger effort to change driver behavior in work zones by strengthening enforcement methods and increasing education. Distracted driving, aggressive driving and speeding are the leading causes of work zone crashes, according to the State Highway Administration.\n\"Most crashes are not accidents,\" State Highway Administrator William Pines told Capital News Service. \"In reality, they're very preventable. The majority of crashes that occur happen because of behaviors with drivers. So if we want to stop the root cause of most crashes, we've got to deal with driver behavior.\"\nBut the law offers no safety solutions for incidents like the collapse of the Key Bridge, which was unrelated to driver behavior. Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld told Capital News Service on Tuesday that officials may consider structural solutions to bolster bridge safety but are awaiting the results of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board before making any specific policy proposals.\nInstead, lawmakers responded to the bridge collapse by recognizing the toll that work zone crashes leave on workers' families.\nIn the final hours of the legislative session, the General Assembly passed the Protecting Opportunities and Regional Trade (PORT) Act, primarily aimed at providing emergency aid to workers and businesses affected by the closure of the Port of Baltimore.\nMoore's administration offered a successful amendment to the bill creating the Fallen Transportation Workers Scholarship Program, providing tuition assistance for five years of full-time study or eight-years of part-time study to children and spouses of workers who have died on the job since 2022.\n\"What happened on the bridge is horrifically traumatic, and I think one of the things that we wanted to do is protect others who are in a similarly dangerous situation,\" said Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), who co-sponsored the PORT Act.\n\"Certainly, we wish there were no one participating in that fund, but sadly, we know how dangerous this work is,\" he continued. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With the help of scientists from abroad (immigrants like Einstein who spent the rest of his career as a physics professor at Princeton), the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Berkeley were major players in developing the atomic bomb that made us a superpower in the first place.\nNot only have our scientists given us satellite radio, smart phones and the internet, which we rely on in Talbot County, they have also given us missile shields, drones and other smart weapons. Future conflicts will be fought with high-tech systems — not yesterday's weapons — and we must keep up with their development.\nI can understand a certain amount of animosity toward the stereotype professor or scientist, but I can't understand why one would want to harm our research programs and universities, which are the envy of the world. We need to urge Andy Harris and other Eastern Shore leaders to push back against Trump's terrible mistake.\nRALPH MEYER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trooper 7 guided ground rescue crews to the victim location, but conditions proved to be inaccessible by foot or boat.MSP's Trooper 2, which is based at Joint Base Andrews, was dispatched at about 1:20 a.m. to assist with a hoist extraction and take over rescue operations.Once overhead, the pilots on Trooper 2 hovered the Leonardo AW-139 helicopter approximately 50 feet above the marshy terrain while a trooper/paramedic was lowered below to assess the victim.The victim was extracted utilizing the air-lift rescue vest. The trooper/paramedic and victim were hoisted back into the aircraft.Trooper 2 then landed at a landing zone established by the Dorchester County Fire and EMS Department, where the victim was transferred to ground paramedics for a secondary evaluation.The victim ultimately did not require treatment or transport.The Maryland State Police Aviation Command has served Maryland citizens since 1970 and operates a fleet of 10 AW-139 helicopters from seven bases throughout the State. Each aircraft provides coverage 24/7/365 to Maryland residents and visitors.The MSPAC missions include medevac, law enforcement, search and rescue, homeland security and disaster assessment.The success of the missions relies heavily on the cooperative efforts of local fire, rescue, EMS, law enforcement agencies and partners at the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Park Police. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local brewer collaborates with brewery to unveil beer for Waterfowl\n\n November 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Some people keep lists of potential baby names. Doug Greene keeps lists of potential beer names.\"I have a whole list on my phone of beer names,\" he said.\nThe Bird Nickel Brewing Company owner's passion for making beer started with a home brewing kit in 2009. Eight years later, Greene took a beer business course, and 10 years later, he incorporated Bird Nickel Brewing. In 2021, he graduated from American Brewers Guild, a brewing school in Vermont.\nAlthough he's still looking for a brick-and-mortar brewery, Greene has done contract brewing, where he employs another brewery to brew beer for him. Through contract brewing, he has created brews with names like \"Slick Calm Chesapeake Ale\" and \"Quite the Mixture.\"\nGreene said the beer names often come from observation or overheard phrases. Slick calm, he said, is a term for when water is \"smooth like glass.\"\nBird Nickel Brewing's latest creation — a limited edition collaboration with Salisbury-based Burnish Brewing Company and Waterfowl Festival Inc. — is \"In Flight,\" a winter lager.\nThe beer will be released for the Waterfowl Festival so that attendees can sip on the limited edition brew while they throw back oysters and chow down on other Eastern Shore fare.\nThe lager has subtle notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and pear. Greene said different people might pick up on different notes.\n\"What we didn't want to do is overwhelm people with cinnamon,\" he said. \"We want to make it enjoyable for everyone.\"\nWaterfowl Festival Executive Director Deena Kilmon said the beer goes perfectly with hors d'oeuvres like oysters.\n\"Like when you're getting ready to eat dinner and you just really have something special to start,\" she said.\nGreene, an Easton native, has \"always wanted to do a beer for the Waterfowl Festival.\" The festival has been a part of his life for years, whether volunteering as a \"duck sitter\" in high school or walking the festival on the hunt for food trucks as an adult.\nGreene's favorite memories of the event are walking down Harrison Street and seeing all the different vendors.\nIn the summer, Kilmon reached out to Greene about making a beer for the festival. This is the first year the festival is collaborating with brewers to make a special beer. The idea was one Greene had brought up to Kilmon years ago.\n\"When I became executive director in March, it was one of our first conversations about how we finally felt like it was the right year to launch it,\" Kilmon said.\nOnce Greene got Burnish Brewing on board, it was all systems go.\nThe label wrapped around the can is also a local effort. Maggii Sarfaty, an Easton artist, designed the label. On it, the festival's mission of conservation, education and research to protect local wildlife and habitats is written.\nA portion of the proceeds from beer sales will go toward the Waterfowl Festival to fund education and conservation, Kilmon said.\nGreene said having his beer at the festival is an important milestone.\n\"Especially for my business,\" he said. \"And being able to create something for the festival instead of just being a resident or a ticket holder. I'm actually a part of it.\"\nIn Flight will be available at the festival's Premier Night on Nov. 7 in all the art pavilions. It will be free to VIP ticket holders while supplies last. Throughout the weekend, VIP ticket holders can request In Flight in the VIP hospitality suite. In Flight can be purchased at the new Duck Blind Bar located within the Avalon Theatre. Festival participants will also be able to sample the beer in the tasting pavilion located on Dover Street with the purchase of a tasting pavilion ticket. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Altair staff complied and removed the chains but kept the gates closed, according to Lewis-Sisco.\nAltair Apartment staff did not respond to a request for comment.\nAccording to the notice distributed to residents, the measures were put in place for an unauthorized \"Freaknik\" event scheduled to take place in the area.\nEight arrests were made at a Freaknik event held at the same location last year. Police said in a news release following the 2024 event that officers deployed pepper spray and departmental-issued tasers \"to affect arrest and to keep hostile crowds back from officers.\"\nThough this year's event was cancelled, police maintained a heavy presence in the area for the next few days. Todd said the increased presence was due to social media rumblings of a large crowd for the \"Freaknik\" event. He said the department wanted to ensure the safety of residents and visitors.\n\"You know, our main goal and our presence, which we always try to keep our presence in all of our higher crime areas or where we've experienced major crimes to keep our residents safe and that's our number one goal and our number one priority,\" Todd said.\nHowever, Lewis-Sisco said many Ward 2 residents felt differently about the police presence. \"The increased police presence and safety precautions that were put in place and implemented on Saturday definitely made residents feel inferior,\" she said.\nTraffic diversions and police presence made navigating the area difficult, Lewis-Sisco said. Some residents informed Lewis-Sisco that they went the entire weekend without medication or aid because health care workers could not reach them due to the gates being closed.\n\"I think the other part was that residents were infuriated that these precautions were taken for an event when there has been unresponsiveness about complaints that regard their living conditions,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If so, you must do something to reduce the number. Today's deal features one such play technique.Against four spades, West led the club ace. When East signaled with the 10, West continued with the club king and a third club. East exited with the spade three: two, eight, king. How should South have continued?South's three-spade rebid was invitational. North, with the two top trump honors, had an automatic raise to game.With all of the side suits safe, declarer's only concern was the trump suit. If that was breaking 3-2, he would have no trouble, but what if East had started with four spades including the jack?(If West had jack-fourth, the contract was beyond resuscitation.) The only chance would be a trump coup. To reduce his trump length to the same as East's, South made the farsighted play of immediately cashing dummy's heart ace and ruffing a heart in his hand.After declarer had played a trump to dummy's ace, getting the bad news, he ruffed another heart in his hand. Then South cashed his three diamond tricks, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.South was left with the Q-10 in spades, and East had the J-5. When South called for a heart, East's apparent trump trick disappeared in a textbook trump coup.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He's been bringing his wildlife sculptures to the Waterfowl Festival for around a decade.The South Dakota couple was stationed inside of the Waterfowl's main building for the Art at the Armory display. Directly across sat Carol Heiman-Greene and her husband, all the way from Orange, California.\nThe two artists and their respective spouses aren't just acquaintances. They're friends, or better yet, family.\n\"I come back year after year, and these are like my families,\" Heiman-Greene said of the fellow artists she's come to know. Kara Green used that exact same word — family — to describe her and her husband's friendship with the Heiman-Greenes and others.\nCarol Heiman-Greene, who's been an exhibitor at the Easton festival for about 20 years, says there's a \"core\" of artists who have been at Waterfowl and other festivals for a long time. She said when new artists come, it's a joy to welcome them into the family, too.\nOn Saturday, Heiman-Greene pointed out her painting of a California condor vulture, laughing since Jim Green had a sculpture of a California condor for sale.\nThrough the ups and downs of travel, sales and weather, Heiman-Greene said artists have \"all sorts of tales (they) can share\" with one another.\n\"You come to these (festivals), and you see your friends from last year and years previous,\" Jim Green said. \"It's so nice to connect with people.\"\nGreen says he loves those friendships with fellow artists not just for the relationships, but also to expand his work in an environment rich with creative ideas.\n\"You have a tendency to think of the world as built on artists when you come to these, because you see so many of them,\" he continued. \"And then you get home and you're in this desert of nobody else around you that does this. So it's really nice to have that creativity, that creative aspect of things to bounce ideas off of other people.\"\nFor the Green couple, it's not a competitive environment. Last year, Jim Green said someone stopped by to let him know they recreated his raven coat rack sculpture.\n\"I know there are other artists that would kind of take that the wrong way,\" he said. \"But I was like, 'Yeah, where are the pictures? I love that.'\"\nBoth Carol Heiman-Greene and Jim Green said the people, atmosphere and weather at Waterfowl combine to make the festival one of their favorites. While Green said his sales are typically solid at Waterfowl, even if they weren't, the three-day event is still his \"favorite one of the year.\"\n\"I love coming here to see the atmosphere and everything there is about Maryland,\" Heiman-Greene said. \"It's really fun. It has such a small-town atmosphere.\"\nDespite living states and plane rides apart, the annual Waterfowl Festival tradition has helped bring the Greens and Heiman-Greenes together as artists and friends. It's a trend Jim Green hopes continues for years to come.\n\"Art sells art,\" Jim Green said. \"If you can't have all boats rise, you shouldn't be in the boat.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An absolutely unneeded honking horn is startling and rather than achieving its likely objective of hurrying me along and making me drive in the manner in which you think I should be driving actually slows me down when I look once more to reassess the situation around me before I move away from that light or stop sign or turn against traffic.\nYou will be senior drivers someday yourself, and you will understand certain facts — namely your reaction time slows a touch, your hearing and vision, though adequate for the task, are not what they used to be and your trust in your own cognition in discerning what is happening around you is quite naturally slightly diminished.\nTalbot County and the town of Easton today present challenging driving conditions. The sheer volume of traffic, the narrow streets in town with double parking, and the plethora of large sized pickups and SUVs plying streets and roadways here that were not designed for these types of vehicles are factors, as well as the presence of some dangerous intersections lacking traffic controls — one of these is one I use daily, the intersection of the Parkway and Tristan Drive. I do not need an accident at my age, whether my fault or not. This is a major reason I (and many others of my age) need that extra moment of time to cope safely and competently with the driving situations already mentioned. And I can cope if I get just a minimum amount of cooperation from all of you others on the road.\nJOEL S.

Its premiere there made it a rare series to run on three different broadcast networks, since the original show - hosted by Monty Hall, also (along with business partner Stefan Hatos) a creator and producer of it - ran on NBC from 1963 to 1966, then moved to ABC, where it continued until 1976.There also were other editions before the Brady-hosted revival premiered, with NBC attempting it again twice, in daytime with Bob Hilton and (very briefly) in prime time with Bush.Brady has earned two of his five Emmy Awards for his work on \"Let's Make a Deal,\" and by the time he started that job, the idea of comedians becoming gameshow hosts had been accepted. Among examples, Drew Carey assumed the hosting spot on \"The Price Is Right\" in 2007, and Louie Anderson had guided \"Family Feud\" from 1999 to 2002 (Steve Harvey started in the latter show in 2010).In interviews, Brady has maintained that he never wanted to be just one thing in the entertainment world not exclusively an actor nor a comic (a skill he has displayed plentifully on the improvisation-oriented \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\") nor a singer (he was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award for his cover of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"). He also has appeared on Broadway in \"Chicago,\" \"Freestyle Love Supreme\" and \"Kinky Boots.\" Along with \"The Price Is Right,\" extra episodes of \"Let's Make a Deal\" have been made expressly for CBS' prime time lineup. That will continue for both shows during the upcoming television season, when they are slated to be seen on Friday nights starting in November. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best in show: 4-H kids work hard to raise, ready animals for fair\n\n July 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard Special to the Whig | Section: News \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL — In the months leading up to the Cecil County Fair, 4-H members can be found working hard, raising and training their animals to get them ready for the fair.At the fair, the animals are one of the main attractions, housed in the fairgrounds' barns in between the various competitions and showings that take place throughout fair week.\nTails and Trails 4-H club worked together this year to try something new: raising and showing 100 meat chickens.\n\"They eat and drink a whole lot more than you would ever imagine at this point. We bought a bag of feed yesterday and we are almost out of it,\" 4-H member Katilyn Carter said.\nCarter, 16, is showing meat goats, meat chickens, and doing herdsmen with her pony. Herdsmen entails keeping your animal at the fair all week, ensuring they are fed, watered, healthy and clean, with a corresponding informational board to educate the public and judges about your animal.\nTo prepare her meat chickens, Carter washes them two to three days before the show to ensure they have a natural oily shine. This paid off, as her chickens won first and second place ribbons at the fair over the weekend.\n\"It's going to sound really funny, but you actually blow dry them. You want them to be really fluffy…You just want them to look like little chunk balls of fluff and meat,\" said Carter about preparing her chickens for show day.\nIn showmanship competitions, you must be very knowledgeable about your animal in order to show the judges that you put in the work to be successful, according to Carter. The 4-H member must present their animal to the best of their ability, demonstrating cleanliness and knowledge on what they eat, their parts, their breed and more, said former 4-H member and long-time judge Carolyn Lawrence.\nFor meat goats, who are bred and raised to become a meal on someone's plate, the 4-H members start working with them once they are born in January or March. A few weeks later, once they're weaned from their mothers they start training them to walk with a halter and lead line, taking them on mile long walks several times a week, according to Libby Kondracki, Tails and Trails leader.\nWhen it comes to show day at the fair, Carter washes her goat in the morning and covers him to ensure he stays clean white. Since they're raised for meat, she then blow dries the animals to get them looking as fluffy as possible. According to county fair regulations, no baby powder, artificial coloring, or adhesives like hairspray can be used on the animals.\n\"The power in fitting your animal, and knowing how to fit your animal and showing your animal to make it to where you know you're showing this animal the best you can to its fullest potential. You really have to work with your goat,\" Carter said.\nBefore the fair, members get together at least twice a week and meet up as a show team and prepare together. Many of the 4-H parent leaders were 4-H members themselves when they were growing up. And many current members plan to stay involved after they age out at 18 years old to continue to give back to the community that helped shape them.\n\"I really love teaching them,\" said Carter about helping teach younger 4-H'ers. \"Because they're going to be, you know, when I'm done in two more years, they're going to be the ones that are taking over. So you really want them to be the mentor you kids that you were to them.\"\nAlthough many 4-H members compete against each other at the Cecil County Fair, they are all a team at the end of the day.\n\"When one wins, we all win,\" said Carter.\nIn addition to the camaraderie 4-H supplies, it also helps educate the public about the livestock they often consume.\nThanks to being involved in the Rising Sun 4-H Club for the past four years, Mason Gentry enjoys educating the public about his animals and their purposes. For example, he explained the importance of knowing that a Heifer is a female cow who has not been bred yet, a cow is a female cow who has been bred and had a calf, and a Steer is a male cow that's been castrated and is meant for beef.\n\"The goal of the fair is to educate the public about agriculture, give them an opportunity to see where the food comes from,\" said Mark Barczewki, 4-H Barn Stompers club leader. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the EPA findings, MDE improperly issued a federal air permit under the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations and MDE has been ordered to reissue the permit with corrected appeal instructions or face legal backlash.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) said that the EPA's ruling was a \"major victory for the Eastern Shore, the environment and our local economies that are existentially threatened by this project.\"\nHarris cited environmental risks of offshore wind projects as disturbance of the sea bottom and ocean ecology, toxic hydraulic and lubricating fluids that could leak and the risk of turbine damage.\nHarris said a similar project in New Jersey led by Atlantic Shores led to the developer abandoning the project after the appeals. These appeals came after President Donald Trump signed an executive order after taking office in January that froze new federal wind leases and permits while reviewing existing projects.\nAccording to Harris, constituents are concerned over the impacts on Ocean City and commercial fishermen saying U.S. Wind has not honored its promise to keep turbines at least 17 miles offshore and allegedly now plans to build turbines as close as 10 miles.\n\"Writ large, the problem with Maryland is that we have not had a good energy policy for years exemplified by the fact that we have to import 40% of our power from surrounding states, including West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which generate their electricity from fossil fuels,\" Harris said. \"So it's unclear to me why we would attempt to brag about, you know, going to 100% renewable energy when we know that's probably not possible.\"\nMaryland agencies like MDE may not be fully equipped to handle federal delegations for such projects and ultimate authority is retained by federal agencies. Because of this, companies like Atlantic Shores in New Jersey canceled its project and plans to come back when the political climate is more favorable, according to a PBS news report.\n\"We received the letter and are reviewing it now. MDE is committed to ensuring all our permit processes are transparent and in accordance with the law,\" Jay Apperson, deputy director of communications for MDE said in a statement to the Star Democrat.\nHarris said he is categorically opposed to offshore wind energy but is not opposed to alternative sources of clean energy like geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors, which he said are much safer alternatives.\n\"Such as the Vienna Power plant that is scheduled to close in five years, and obviously has permitting to generate power there. Locations like that might be ideal for small modular reactors,\" Harris said.\nWhile the EPA identified procedural issues with how MDE directed the public to appeal the permit, Harris characterized the letter as validation of broader concerns about the project's approval and local opposition. US Wind did not respond for a comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I'm just haunted by that team.\"\nMason Kaplan netted a hat trick and helped set up both of Casey Burkom's goals Friday, as the Crusaders defeated the Sabres, 5-2, at the Talbot Community Center to clinch the second seed in next week's Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference playoffs.\nSt. Paul's (6-2-1) is scheduled to host third-seeded Sts. Peter & Paul (5-3-2) on Monday at 4 p.m. in an MIAA B semifinal at the Patterson Park Ice Rink in Baltimore.\n\"This has been a really fun season,\" Gerdano said. \"We have a really young team. We have 11 freshmen out of 22 rostered. So it's not surprising that maybe they're lacking confidence at times.\"\nThe Crusaders controlled the neutral zone through the first period, and put half a dozen shots on goalie Maddie Maloney in the opening 3 minutes.\n\"It's exactly what we were asking for; a fast start,\" St. Paul's head coach Sean Baker said. \"We wanted to get pucks behind their D, play down in their end at the beginning of the game to set the tone early.\"\nDespite that dominance, Maloney (25 saves) didn't let anything past her until 3 minutes, 24 seconds remained in opening period, when Andrew Breslin and Burkom set up Kaplan's first goal.\nSt. Paul's extended that lead to 2-0 just 38 seconds into the second period, when Kaplan fed Burkom, who slipped the puck inside the left post.\n\"Goals in the first minute of the period and the last minute of the period are always big,\" Baker said. \"You want to keep momentum for the beginning of the period and the end of the period. It's something that we talk about; first and last minute. We want to be the ones that score. We don't want to give anything up.\"\nThe Sabres cut their deficit to 2-1 with 3:44 left, as Drew Watson scored off a dish from Mason Roland. Sts. Peter & Paul went on the power play a little over a minute later, but put little pressure on St. Paul's goalie Andrew Dugas (13 saves). The Crusaders killed off the 2-minute minor. then immediately restored their two-goal cushion, as Kaplan — the MIAA B's goal-scoring leader with 21 — scored off Burkom's assist with 30.2 seconds left in the period.\n\"Obviously that's a big momentum shift, Gerdano said. \"You cut the lead in half and they get one right back. That's a little bit of a gut punch. But it's a long game and we're always telling our players you just got to keep fighting to the end.\"\nSt. Paul's widened its lead to 4-1 with 1:53 elapsed in the third, as Kaplan and Nigel Wilson-Phillippi set up Burkom's second goal. That lead ballooned to 5-1 with 8:32 remaining, when Brendan Townsend and Burkom connected passes to set up Kaplan in the slot for his third goal.\n\"We seem to be peaking at the right time,\" said Baker, whose team has won three straight. \"We're looking pretty good right now.\"\nAfter a brief skirmish with a little under 7 minutes remaining left the Crusaders down a man, Sts. Peter & Paul's Buel Jenson scored unassisted with 6:45 to play. But the Sabres couldn't cut any further into their deficit.\n\"We absolutely came out flat,\" Gerdano said. \"We were throwing the puck away like crazy. I think we were a little afraid to have the puck on our stick, not quite confident enough with the puck. A little uncharacteristic and it's something we can improve on going into next week. If we find that confidence and find good energy we can absolutely take it to that team.\n\"When they have that confidence you can tell, and we're really hard to play against,\" added Gerdano, whose team tied St. Paul's 2-2 earlier this season. \"We have great goaltending. We're hard to score on and we got great defense. We just need to find ways to score. And if we do that we're going to be really hard to beat against anybody. We have the recipe.\"\nNote: The Sabres have tied St. Paul's three times under Gerdano's direction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cooking fresh fish on Delmarva\n\n April 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1090\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A sure sign of Spring on Delmarva is the local catch-of-the-day fish in the seafood stores, fish markets and at the boat docks.This past week and in the upcoming weeks local organizations are having fish fries. Check out the local newspapers and posts at the different stores in town to find the date and location information.\nNot only will you be enjoying fresh fish, but you will be enjoying some delicious home cooking prepared by some wonderful Eastern Shore cooks. Most of these suppers have cornbread, turnip greens, stewed tomatoes and fried potatoes as sides — mouth-watering country cooking.\nCrab season opened April 1 — one of my favorite forms of seafood. In the summer I will share some recipes and some crabbing stories with you.\nMost of all, hats off to the local watermen for their hard work. Let's cook Fish.\nGOLDEN FRIED FISH\nCombine 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon cooking oil and 2/3 cup cold water. Blend well. Beat 1 egg white until soft peaks form, and fold in the flour mixture. Dip 1 pound to 1 1/2 pounds of fish fillets, cut into serving sizes, into this mixture on both sides. Place fillets into a fry pan with 1/2 inch oil and fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and serve warm with some vegetables and red skin potatoes.\nOVEN BAKED FISH\nCut 2 pounds of fish, cleaned and filleted, into serving size portions. Add 1 tablespoon salt to 1 cup milk. Dip fillets in milk and roll into 1 cup dried bread crumbs. Place in a well greased baking pan. Sprinkle each piece of fish with minced or chopped butter pieces. Bake in a 500-degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until fish flakes easily when touched with a fork. Serve with fresh vegetables and macaroni and cheese.\nFRIED CATFISH\nCombine 2/3 cup cornmeal, 1/4 cup flour, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Dry 4 cleaned catfish fillets and coat them on each side with the cornmeal mixture. Fry in 1/2 cup oil until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.\nSALMON CAKES\nCombine 1 pound fresh salmon meat with 2 beaten eggs, 4 tablespoons bread crumbs and 3 to 4 tablespoons milk — add one tablespoon of milk at a time to determine consistency. Mix and form into cakes. Fry in hot oil until golden brown on both sides.\nBAKED FISH WITH TOMATOES\nCut about 1 1/2 pounds fresh fish fillets into serving sizes and single layer fish in a well greased two quart casserole dish. Spread 2 teaspoons of mustard over the fish. Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper on top of mustard. Peel and slice two fresh tomatoes over top of mustard mixture. Mix together one cup grated Parmesan cheese with 1/4 cup butter or margarine and spread over the fish mixture. Cover and bake in a preheated 325-degree oven for 30 minutes.\nGRILLED MARYLAND BLUE FISH\n2 pounds Maryland bluefish fillets, 2 cups Italian salad dressing, 2 lemons (cut in wedges). Place bluefish fillets in a baking dish. Pour dressing over fillets, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Place fillets on a hot, oiled grill. Baste fillets frequently with dressing and cook for about 10 minutes. Turn and baste again. Fillets are done when they just begin to flake when tested with a fork. Serve with lemon wedges. For convenient cooking on charcoal grill, cover grill with foil and poke holes in foil to circulate heat.\nMARYLAND BAKED PERCH\n3 pounds perch (dressed), 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 3 medium sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup sliced onion, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper, 1 cup orange juice, 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind, 1 tablespoon flour. Preheat the oven to 450. Season fish with salt and pepper. Place fish in a baking dish. In a bowl, combine mushrooms, onions and green pepper. Spread vegetable mixture over fish. Combine remaining ingredients in a saucepan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently until mixture thickens. Pour sauce over fish and vegetables. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.\nGARLIC ROASTED SEA BASS\n4 whole heads fresh garlic (trimmed), 4 large garlic cloves (peeled and crushed), olive oil, sea salt, 4 to 5 pounds whole sea bass (rinsed and well dried), black pepper, 1 lemon with 1/2 half cut in thin slices and other half juiced. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Slice top 1/4 inch from each whole head of garlic. Remove some of the papery skin from the outside, but do not separate the cloves. Place the garlic heads in the roasting pan. Pour olive oil over each head. Sprinkle it with salt. Set aside. Season the fish with olive oil, crushed garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Place lemon slices and crushed garlic cloves inside the fish. Roast fish and whole garlic heads in a roasting pan, with rack, uncovered, 30 to 40 minutes, basting often.\nSIMPLE FRIED BLUEFISH\n4 bluefish fillets, 1 bowl of milk, 2 eggs (beaten), 2 cups flour, 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet, 3 tablespoons parsley (chopped), 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 lemon (cut into wedges). Place all of the fillets in a bowl of milk and let soak for several minutes. Dip fillet in a bowl of well beaten eggs. Season flour with parsley, paprika, lemon pepper and salt. Roll each fillet in flour. Heat oil to medium-high.Place fillets in hot oil. Fry to a golden brown, turning once. Remove fillet from pan and layer over paper towels. Serve hot or cold with wedges of lemon.\nGRILLED MARLIN STEAKS\n2 large marlin steaks (about 3/4-inch thick), 1/3 cup pineapple juice, 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, 1/2 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce, 1 large clove garlic (minced), 1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger (minced), freshly ground black pepper (to taste). In a small bowl, combine pineapple juice, grapeseed oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and black pepper. Whisk all the ingredients until well blended. Put marlin steaks in a large resealable bag and pour the marinade over. Close the bag and massage/flip it until the steaks are well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator for 1 to 1 ½ hours, turning and massaging steaks once or twice. Preheat barbecue to 500-550 degrees. Place the marlin steaks on a plate and discard the marinade.Transfer the steaks on the hot grill, close the lid and grill for 3 minutes on one side. Flip them and cook for another 2 minutes with the lid closed. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "An age in America comes to an end\n\n May 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Columns \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The small town of Oroville, California, drifted into the 20th century as a shadow of its former self.Back in 1848, when gold was discovered in the area, prospectors had poured into the place. But by 1900 the vein had long since petered out, and the town had become little more than an agricultural backwater.\nMeanwhile, the modern world marched on. In Los Angeles, California's first movie theater opened for business in 1902. The next year, the Wright brothers made the first heavier-than air flight at Kitty Hawk. And in 1908, Henry Ford brought the automobile within reach of everyday Americans when he introduced the reliable, relatively inexpensive Model T.\nStill, news of these wonders would have arrived in Oroville as little more than rumors of a wider, more sophisticated world.\nThen, on Aug. 29, 1911, a teenaged layabout named Floyd Hefner strode into the corral of the local slaughterhouse, intending to hitch up a team of horses, and found a nearly naked man leaning unsteadily against a fence-post. The last living member of a Native American tribe had come in from the cold.\nPerhaps not surprisingly for the time and place, guns were drawn, dogs were held at bay, and someone used the telephone in the slaughterhouse to call the law. By the time the sheriff arrived, a butcher's cloak had been thrown over the shoulders of the man, who spoke no language anyone understood. The sheriff handcuffed the man, drove him into town in a wagon (the first time in his life he'd ever ridden in a wheeled vehicle), and locked him up in the county jail.\nIt wasn't long before newspapers throughout the state were reporting the discovery of America's \"last wild Indian.\" Learning of the news, Alfred Kroeber, a renowned professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, sent a colleague, Thomas Waterman, up to Oroville.\nMeeting with the prisoner in his cell, Waterman thought he might be speaking a language related to the Yana tongue. Waterman knew a little Yana, and when he tried it out on the prisoner, the man's face lit up.\nFor the first time since the only other members of his Yahi band had died, he had heard another human being speak a word or two he understood.\nWaterman was able to ask the man his name. Using a combination of gestures and simple Yahi, the man explained that in his culture it was taboo to speak his name aloud to someone else until another member of his tribe had formally introduced him. As this was now impossible, Waterman ended up simply calling him \"Man\" in the Yahi tongue.\nAnd so it is that this Native American man comes down to us in history under the false name of \"Ishi.\" We will never know what his real name was.\nWaterman's fellow professor at Berkeley, Alfred Kroeber, was a remarkable man. He had earned his doctorate in 1901 from Columbia University, studying under Franz Boaz, the father of modern anthropology. Kroeber took Ishi in and gave him a place to live in the university's museum, where Ishi worked as a janitor. This allowed Kroeber and the other anthropologists in his department to study Ishi closely over the remaining five years of his life.\nYou might expect that much of what Kroeber and Waterman learned from Ishi would have been horrifying. This was a man who, from boyhood, watched his tribe and immediate family whittled down by ceaseless slaughter. Norman Kingsley, an eager participant in one of the last massacres, later recounted that, in the middle of his attack, he exchanged his .56 caliber Spencer rifle for a .38 caliber pistol, because the rifle \"tore them up so bad,\" especially the babies.\nBut after his introduction into modernizing California, accounts say Ishi didn't speak of the horrors he'd witnessed, nor did he give in to melancholy or despair. He adapted with grace to his new life and embraced many of the changes happening in the world around him.\nI learned of Ishi from Alfred Kroeber's wife and fellow anthropologist Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, who, in 1961, wrote \"Ishi in Two Worlds,\" now considered a classic of modern anthropology. I first read the book 40 years ago, and rereading it recently, I found myself placing Theodora Kroeber in the same league as Claude Lévi-Strauss. Without ever leaving any of her anthropological principles behind, she consistently writes clear, compelling prose.\nIt isn't easy reading the first part of Kroeber's book, watching as Ishi and the remaining members of his band are forced to withdraw further and further from the whites encroaching upon their world; until, finally, they retreat into that world's last untouched cañon, and, ultimately, its last bushy slopes.\nBut Kroeber's description of the way Ishi handles the world he is then brought into, the way he maintains his Yahi dignity in the face of that world's awesome power (while never losing his ability to see through its sometimes absurd idiosyncrasies) is somehow reassuring. It gave me hope for humanity at large.\nI reread \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" thanks to an Inter-Library Loan, but a copy of the book has now been placed in our collection at the Talbot County Free Library. You'll find it in the Easton library on the Biography shelves under the call letters ISHI. If you're in St. Michaels, you can place a reserve on the book and it will be sent down there for you. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thoughts on smart phone restrictions in schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 981\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Pew Research Center survey reports that 95% of teenagers in America have a smart phone or have access to one. It also reports that 45% of teenagers say they are online nearly all the time.Many have suggested this has resulted in a measurable and serious negative impact on the learning environment in middle and high school classrooms. Others have suggested this has resulted in a serious negative impact on standardized student achievement test scores.\nAs a result, countless school districts in America have put or will be putting new or more restrictions on student smart phones during the school day. Two-thirds of schools in Maryland have already. Talbot County is joining them. Beginning Dec. 2, Easton Middle School will will require students to lock their phones in secure pouches during the school day.\nThese restrictions have significant public support. Surveys conducted by the Talbot County school district reported 94% of parents/guardians and 96% of staff said there should be restrictions on cell phone use during the school day. 90% of parents/guardians and 95% of staff said students should not be allowed to have their phones \"visible and usable\" during class instruction.\nWhile I understand and respect these opinions, I suggest restrictions in schools are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among American youth.\nI understand and respect these decisions. At the same time, I suggest they are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression, and suicidality among American youth.\nIn his book Haidt references research showing a measure of anxiety for individuals between ages of 8 to 25 has increased 139% between 2010 and 2020.The measure for depression during the same period, often the result of an inability to resolve interpersonal conflicts or relationship difficulties, has increased 106%.\nHaidt suggests three reasons why.\nThe first is the decline of the what Haidt calls play-based childhood. He maintains children need lots of free play time to prepare them for success as an adult. Out of fears for their safety, many American parents and guardians have reduced children's access to unsupervised free play. The loss of free play and the rise of continual (some may say \"smothering\") adult supervision has deprived children of what they needed most to overcome the normal fears and anxieties of childhood: the chance to explore, test and expand their limits, build close friendships through shared adventure and learn how to judge risks for themselves.\nThe second is what Haidt calls rise of the phone-based childhood, which began in the late 2000s and accelerated in the early 2010s. Haidt notes this was precisely the period during which adolescents traded in their flip phones for smartphones. These smartphones were loaded with social media platforms supported by the new high-speed internet and unlimited data plans that has drastically reshaped the social media landscape for adolescents.\nThe third is what Heidt calls an over reliance on technology that has all but eliminated unstructured face to face interactions from the lives of children and adolescents.\nHeidt concludes the negative impact of all three reasons was made worse by many well-intentioned parents, including himself. He writes: \"We did not fully understand what was happening in children's virtual worlds and did not grasp that tech companies had designed their online products to be addictive.\"\nAs a result, Haidt asserts that all these trends combined, have robbed entire generations of opportunities to develop the resilience, coping skills and independence needed to navigate everyday stressors, and in turn, created unprecedented levels of anxiety at a societal level.\nHe says these generations have not learned from valuable opportunities to engage in and learn from manageable risks, typical setbacks, failures and healthy social challenges.\nWhat can be done going forward?\nHaidt offers the following proactive suggestions for parents and guardians of children in elementary, middle and high schools.\nInstead of a giving younger students a smartphone as their first phone, give them a basic phone.\nDo not give them a smartphone until high school. Delay the opening of accounts on nearly all social media platforms until the beginning of high school, at least.\nWill his suggestions be popular with students? Not likely, especially given the immense power of peer pressure that characterizes life for students in schools at all levels.\nOne school in Maryland recently surveyed seniors on a new more restrictive smart phone policy to limit the overuse of smart phones during the school day. The questions and answers were: \"Do you know overuse of cell phones is harmful? Yes. Do you want to give it up? No.\"\nAre Haidt's suggestions still necessary since efforts are underway when an increasing number of schools are adopting on new or more restrictive rules on smart phone access? Yes.\nDespite best intentions and best efforts, schools alone cannot address this problem. One Maryland school district superintendent has observed with thinly disguised frustration — \"Students are in school for just 20% of their week. We can't control the other 80% of the time that we don't have them.\"\nThose with some control over most of the other 80% of student's time outside of school are parents and guardians.\nGoing forward, parents and guardians need to fully embrace two concepts. Success for them is not based on winning a popularity contest with those whom they are entrusted with their care and upbringing. Success for them is measured in part by a willingness to make sometimes unpopular, but necessary decisions on reasonable limits for a young person's own good.\nIn preparing all our young people for success, they, and our society deserve nothing less. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Annual Back to School Resource Fair: Preparing students for success\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 494\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Tuesday evening, over a thousand people gathered at Idlewild Park for the annual Back to School Resource Fair hosted by For All Seasons.For All Seasons partnered with the Talbot County Department of Social Services to provide families with hundreds of backpacks pre-stuffed with supplies for students. This event not only contributes to the care of students of all ages, but it creates community for residents throughout Easton.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and chief executive officer at For All Seasons, said the resource fair has become one of the largest community events in Easton, bringing together over 25 different organizations and over 1,700 people.\n\"We are really taking care of all of the kids in the ways that set them up for success,\" Dorman said. \"For school, mental health isn't just about our mental health and talk therapy, but it's also about making sure that children have what they need to be able to show up at the school year authentically and with some safety.\"\nIn addition to the school supplies provided by For All Seasons, dozens of organizations set up tables and provided rulers, pens, dental care kits, notebooks and over a hundred children's books.\nMarilou Russ, assistant director for Appleseed Books, said the organization provides free children's books to families across the Eastern Shore by collecting donated books.\n\"We come to programs and events throughout the counties on the mid shore, which would include Caroline, Talbot and now even Dorchester County, and then we give the children out the free books so that they have books,\" Russ said. \"Our belief is that they have their own collection of books that they can call their own.\"\nIncluded in the event, families had the opportunity to enjoy games, free Rita's Italian Ice, and arts and craft activities.\nMayra Casillas, an event attendee, said she just moved to the area and learned of the fair on Facebook. For Casillas, it seemed a great opportunity to engage with her new community and for her children to have fun.\n\"It's also great to have backpacks and a bunch of other school supplies,\" Casillas said. \"It helps families that don't have the income to buy for their kids.\"\nDorman said the event has grown significantly since its origin six years ago. It has reached the point where For All Seasons will be expanding the venue for next year since it has become too crowded for Idlewild Park. Dorman said she is proud of this event and the amount of people it assists.\n\"There are times where we have an opportunity to dig in a little bit deeper as a community,\" Dorman said. \"This is an example of when we think outside of the box, and we really think about the whole person when we're thinking about mental health. It gives us an opportunity to make a difference in a way that maybe is not going to happen in the four walls of an office, but this is real community outreach and community connection and partnership.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Abstract Truths studio art gallery opens in Stevensville\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 509\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Showcasing a world of inspiration around us, Stevensville's newest gallery and art studio Abstract Truth held an official gallery opening Nov. 29.A retired architect, gallery artist Ray Moldenhauer, of Grasonville, focuses his attention on creating abstract paintings and sculptures with dimension, noting \"art is a natural extension of architecture.\"\nOutgrowing his previous space at My Little Studio, Moldenhauer remarked the new location is proving to be a blessing.\nLeaning into layers in his art as well as in his gallery, Moldenhauer designed the space to take full advantage of the existing glass enclosed cubicles and provide natural light.\nBy staggering the paintings from one cubicle to another, the gallery visually takes on a special 3D experience from one space to another. Many of the paintings are mounted back to back on the glass to create an allusion of them floating in the space, according to Moldenhauer.\n\"At night, the extensive front glass wall of the building just glows and reflects the beautiful artwork within,\" he said.\n\"I love the idea of flowing paintings,\" he said.\nMoldenhauer utilizes many different creative techniques for his work. From traditional brushes and sponges, to business cards to even finger painting, Moldenhauer isn't afraid to try something new with his inspiration. Moldenhauer also incorporates resin, cellophane, and even foam to create something completely new.\nFor Moldenhauer it is the inspiration behind each artwork that brings forth its beauty and meaning and makes it \"more than just another landscape or sunset.\"\nMoldenhauer's work typically starts with a Bible verse and lets his inspiration guide his hand, for instance, Moldenhauer sculptures based on the Pillars of Creation present an abstract look of the universe.\nAs an accomplished SCUBA diver, Moldenhauer also finds inspiration in the natural world of water, sunsets and sunrises.\nMoldenhauer also takes inspiration from the surrounding Eastern Shore, has also incorporated his love of the Eastern Shore into his work.\nHis very first sculpture \"Be Still\" repurposed an old sailboat skeg and was selected for the Maryland Federation of Art's Off The Walls 2024 exhibition.\nAccording to Moldenhauer Abstract Truths are works that, \"in some way, reveal God,\" and each art piece has a corresponding Bible verse accompaniment for patrons to take to heart.\nFor artists just starting out, Moldenhauer encouraged finding inspiration around you in what you enjoy doing and where you enjoy being.\n\"There are so many sources of inspiration if we just look,\" he said.\nMoldenhauer welcomes everyone to discover the work for themselves, noting the studio gallery isn't for the purpose of business or making money, \"it's about sharing art,\" he said.\nMoving forward, Moldenhauer looks to collaborate and connect with the surrounding art community and plans to eventually have rotating monthly artists featured and juried art exhibits.\nAbstract Truths is located in the Stevensville Art and Entertainment District at 214 Island Plaza Court. and typically open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nSpecial showings are available by appointment at 410-490-6302.\nMoldenhauer is an award winning abstract artist and Maryland Federation of Art juried exhibitor. He is also a Christian author and music writer with a Youtube channel and Instagram account. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everyone loves baked goods no matter who they may be. So many of us just love watching the faces of the recipients also.\nThe first step and the most important is to have a list of the cookies, candies and cakes you want to make. The second step is to make a list of the ingredients you will need and the third is to get the correct amount of supplies.\nStorage containers for the finished products are important. I save cookie tins throughout the year and purchase other types of paper or cardboard containers whenever they are on sale.\nFinally, choose the day or two where you can bake all day undisturbed. Carry out pizza that evening for the family. Maybe you want to reserve a day or afternoon for the children or grandchildren to help.\nMISS MARY'S CHOCOLATE FUDGE Mix together one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, one small can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 tsp vanilla.

Set aside ¼ cup of the chopped almonds; add the remaining ¾ cup to a large mixing bowl with the brown sugar, butter, egg, vanilla and salt. Use a mixer to cream together until fluffy, then gradually mix in the flour on low speed. Press the cookie dough evenly into the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cookie base is light brown. (It will still be soft.) Remove to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.\nUsing a mixer, beat the softened butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla and about 2 tbsps of milk together until fluffy, adding another spoonful or two of milk if the frosting is too thick to be spreadable. Spread the frosting over the crust, then lightly score the frosting into thirds.

Heat the chocolate in the microwave in 15 second intervals until the chocolate is fully melted. Stir until smooth. Using a fork, dip the peppermint patties into the melted chocolate and place back on the wax paper covered baking sheet. Once all patties have been coated, place the tray back in the fridge and allow the chocolate to set for another 30 minutes. Store the peppermint patties in the fridge until ready to be served!\nNO COOK CHRISTMAS CANDY 1 box Betty Crocker Home Style Fluffy White Frosting Mix 7.2 oz. box, 1/3 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup boiling water, 1 lb. confectioners' sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract or seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean, Assorted holiday sprinkles.\nCover two or more large baking sheets with parchment paper or waxed paper.\nIn the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the frosting mix (dry mix), the corn syrup, and the boiling water.

Don't over mix or you'll deflate the batter. Add the vanilla and mix briefly. The finished mixture should be billowy and light, and a little bit stretchy like classic divinity. Drop candy mixture by the heaping tsp onto the prepared pans. Immediately cover with sprinkles, if desired. Let candies stand, uncovered, until dry to the touch, about 6-8 hours. When the outside of the candies feel firm, turn over. Dry 6 more hours, or overnight.

His letter may leave the impression that Maryland ballots printed at home are then cast online. This is not true.After a ballot is printed from the website, the voter fills it out and mails it in. There is no voting online, so there is no hacking. The printed ballot is mailed and treated with the same scrutiny for authenticity as any other mail-in ballot.\nJEFF BARRON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
