I'd love to see her shot percentage from today. She was amazing. They all were. They played really hard. They executed correctly. They deserved to win.\"\nAnd yet for the third time this season, this rivalry was shaping up to be a duel to the end. Sts. Peter & Paul (12-9), which came in on an eight-game winning streak, broke a 9-9 first-quarter tie when Kaylin Palmer (nine points) hit a bucket and Avery McCall converted one of two from the foul line for a three-point lead after one complete.\nBut the Royals (16-4) began connecting from beyond the arc in the second quarter. Marinelli, who drained four 3-pointers as part of a game-high 20-point performance, freshman Avery McCoy (nine points) and Layni Dukes (11 points) each hit 3-pointers, with Dukes' tying the game at 19-all with 1:31 left in the half.\nLucy Rankin kept the Sabres close, scoring six of her 12 points in the second quarter. A pair of Marinelli free throws and a Dukes layup moved Delmarva Christian to a 23-19 lead before Sts. Peter & Paul's Annie Albright scored to make it a two-point margin at the half.\nThe Royals began to widen their lead early in the third, as Marinelli buried a 3-pointer and Eve Bohinski (10 points) made a three-point play for a 29-21 lead. Emma Hainey's two free throws halted Delmarva Christian's mini-burst.\nAnd though Sts. Peter & Paul remained within striking distance, the Royals began patiently working the ball around the perimeter before driving through the lane for layups that steadily extended their lead. Bohinski and Dukes each found an open lane for layups before McCoy's three-point play pushed Delmarva's Christian's lead to 36-26 late in the third.\n\"We made a couple shots that kind of got us going,\" Royals head coach Frank Roach said. \"The first two games, jump shots weren't really falling much. I think that helped. And then we changed up our defense a little bit in that third quarter and that gave us a little bit of breathing room. I think the defensive switch is what kind of broke the game open.\"\nThe switch from man-to-man to a box-and-one helped Delmarva Christian outscore the Sabres, 13-7, in the third. Still, Sts. Peter & Paul stuck around, Palmer scoring the last basket of the third and the first of the fourth, drawing the Sabres within 36-30.\nBut Marinelli scored on a drive through the paint, hit a 3-pointer, watched Dukes score a layup, then drove through the middle again to give the Royals a 45-32 lead with under 4 minutes remaining.\n\"I told them to space it out,\" Roach said of his team's offense. \"I know they (SSPP) were in a hurry to try to get some turnovers, get some steals. I said, 'Hey. Space the floor, use your handle. Let's attack the basket.' They did a good job attacking the basket.\"\nDelmarva Christian's lead floated between 13 and 15 points before McCall, who notched her sixth double-double of the season with 15 points and 10 rebounds — both team highs — scored the Sabres' final seven points.\n\"I think nerves had a lot to do with it,\" Murphy said of her team. \"I think in some cases we may have wanted to win too much instead of playing our game. Not settling into offense was a real huge thing. We were able to do that in the previous two games. And here they couldn't get their offensive rhythm no matter how many times we said, 'Run this offense. Do this. Slow it down.'\n\"Again, it's a young team,\" added Murphy, who has no seniors on the team. \"They have grown a lot and continue to learn. They're a great group of kids who fought until the very end. There's no reason why they can't do this again next year.\"\nNotes: McCall was named the ESIAC player of the year, and was joined on the all-conference first team by Rankin and Albright. … Hainey was honorable mention. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Claxton was a key piece to the 2023 State Championship for Kent Island High School's varsity men's lacrosse team and also contributed to the 2022 team that took home the state prize. This spring Claxton looks to lead the Bucs to a third-straight title.Athletics at KIHS have been very competitive and successful over the last few years. After two amazing years for the Bucs with the 2022 and 2023 graduating classes, Claxton's commitment to the Class of 2024 is unparalleled.\nLacrosse might be Claxton's best sport, but he's also been on varsity football since sophomore year. In 2022, the Bucs were eliminated in the state quarterfinals and looked to bounce back in 2023. That's exactly what they did. Led by Kasey Heath and Claxton, alongside many other key players the Bucs had on their stacked roster, they were able to make the state championship before falling just short to Milford Mill Academy. Claxton stated, \"There are a few memories that stick out to me. One was being a part of the first team in Kent Island football history to make the state championship. Another was running out of the tunnel to see a couple thousand people supporting you week in and week out. Breaking the receiving record for Kent Island school history was very cool as well.\" Claxton broke this record in his final high school game in a quarterfinal loss to Huntingtown. Claxton has also been a member of the varsity basketball team for the last two years.\nWhen asked about playing three sports during his high school career, Claxton said, \"I haven't had more than really a week off since Covid. I'm always doing something as soon as one season ends I was right on to another. Even the summer was filled with football camp, workouts, and club lacrosse. But this has taught me great discipline and mental toughness which I think is a hard lesson to find.\"\nLast year, Claxton's role on the Buccaneer lacrosse team increased dramatically. His father, Andy Claxton, holds second place as the all-time leader in face off wins at the University of Maryland, and last season served as the offensive coordinator for Kent Island. The state championship in 2023 meant a lot to Tucker Claxton. \"Scoring the game-winning goal in the state semifinals, and winning the state championship with my friends and teammates I've known since kindergarten meant a lot to me. From playing together the whole time, and being able to hug my dad after to celebrate, that was always the dream,\" he said.\nLuke Bonanni is a student reporter from Kent Island High School. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shadowed by top seed Andrew Stein of Huntingtown through the bulk of the race, Marks never surrendered his lead, and never looked close to fading, crossing the finish line in a personal-record 1 minute, 57.60 seconds — 7 seconds ahead of Kent Island senior Giovanni Aguirre, who ran a PR of 2:04.29.\n\"I'm finally getting the speed under me,\" said Marks, who has clocked faster times in the 800 this season while running unattached in other meets. \"I opened up pretty fast in this 800. I just wanted to get free of traffic because I knew my positioning wasn't ideal.\"\nMarks admitted his legs weren't exactly feeling ideal after putting himself through in a tough workout just two days before.\n\"I knew going into today that my legs weren't going to be 100 percent fresh,\" Marks said. \"That was OK because today is not the end-all, be-all. Obviously the main goal is outdoor, dropping down speed. My legs are a little heavy so me running that time, I'm not mad about it.\"\nMarks, who won the same three events at last week's Bayside Conference championships, again began his string of title runs with victory in the 1,600 meters, where he ran a 4:35.27, finishing more than 7 full seconds ahead of second-place Trevor Thompson of La Plata.\nMarks eased to the front as the lead pack thinned in the 3,200, settled into a comfortable pace, and again was never seriously challenged after moving into first, winning in 9:56.66 — 16 seconds ahead of runner-up Brendan Bischof of Huntingtown.\n\"Three wins today and we're moving on,\" said Marks, who will bid for his first state title at the 2A state championships on Feb. 19 at the Prince George's Sports & Learning Complex.\nNorth Caroline's Brooke Sullivan, Autumn Vallee, Linda Ridgell and Seanna Rupp won the girls 4x800-meter relay in 10:40.48, edging second-place Patuxent (10:41.54).\nLike Marks, Ridgell navigated her way through a crowded start in the girls 3,200 meters, found a steady a groove and remained in front while Calvert's Madison McCurry and the rest of the field gave chase for 16 laps.\n\"I just wanted to get a good start and increase my chances of getting first,\" said Ridgell, who won in 12:03.02 — 6 seconds ahead of McCurry.\nThe Caroline junior admitted she began to feel tired and sore, but felt confident she could win as the race reached the 11th lap.\nFive days after clearing 7 feet, 6 inches to finish fourth at Baysides, Kent Island junior Siena Koch curled over the bar with personal-record 9 feet to win the girls pole vault. Koch was also part of the Bucs' 4x200 relay along with Grace Mathews, Naiya Grossman and Ava Tippett, who finished third in 1:53.61.\nThe top three finishers in each event qualified for states, or hit the standard time, height or distance.\nWestlake (94 points) easily won the boys championship, but Kent Island took runner-up honors with 62 points, one point ahead of third-place La Plata.\nIn addition to his second place in the 800, Aguirre delivered another PR in the 500, finishing third in 1:07.48, and ran a leg on Kent Island's third-place 4x800 relay, joining Gunner Hansard, Hudson Scarlett and Caleb Heater to finish in 8:42.89.\nJack Morey cleared 13-6 to lead a 2-3-4 finish in the boys pole vault for Kent Island. Desmond Abbate placed third at 11 feet, and Qualib Carter was fourth at 10 feet. The Bucs also got big points from Jack Middleton, third in the high jump (6 feet) and Josh Fuller, who was fourth in the shot put with a personal-record 46-9.\nNorth Caroline's Amir Long-Brown earned his way to states with a runner-up time of 8.47 in the boys 55-meter hurdles.\nRidgell led North Caroline to a third-place total of 48 points in the girls competition, which was won by Lackey (85). The Bulldogs also got points from multiple sources, with Amanda Snyder taking second in the high jump (4-10), Rupp placing third in the 500 (1:27.66), and Charlotte Stuetzle running a personal-record 2:40.64 for third in the 800.\nEaston's Olivia Orrell placed fourth in the 1,600 with a personal-record 5:54.16. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "USDA awards MARBIDCO funding to assist with expansion of livestock processing\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 545\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - The United States Department of Agriculture recently announced it is awarding $3.8 million from its Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program to the Maryland Agricultural Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation to finance the start-up and expansion of independent meat and poultry processing facilities in Maryland.MARBIDCO is a quasi-governmental economic development and financial intermediary organization with a mission to serve the commercial farming, forestry and seafood industries of Maryland.The USDA Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program awards funds to financial intermediaries, like MARBIDCO, in the form of a grant to allow them to establish specialized revolving loan programs. The objective of the MPILP is to strengthen the financing capacity for small-and midsized independent meat processors, and to create a more resilient, diverse, and secure U.S. food supply chain.MARBIDCO is supplementing the USDA grant with another $1.3 million of its own funds to establish a special pool of lending capital of approximately $5 million.The Maryland Livestock Processing Loan Fund is designed to assist with the expansion of livestock and blue catfish processing capacity in Maryland. Farmers raising cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs still are facing very long lead times to get their animals processed, while blue catfish is an invasive fish species in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries that is having a very detrimental impact on other species of fish and shellfish. Increasing commercial harvest and consumption of these catfish is one way to significantly reduce their numbers.Businesses engaged in the processing of livestock, or the invasive blue catfish can apply for a Maryland Livestock Processing Loan, which may also include an equity incentive grant of up to 10% of the project cost. Loan and grant proceeds can be used to purchase livestock processing and cold storage equipment, build or upgrade meat processing facilities, as well as purchase real estate on which the livestock processing activity will occur.MARBIDCO's Livestock Processing Loan Fund can offer standalone financing or work in conjunction with other financing provided by commercial lenders.\"This should be an incredible win for Maryland. The addition of new or significantly expanded meat processing facilities will positively impact many people within the food supply chain, from farmers and commercial fisherman to consumer's tables with these locally produced protein products,\" said MARBIDCO Executive Director Steve McHenry. \"We are delighted to be a USDA grant recipient, and we want to thank the Maryland Department of Agriculture and our State's entire Congressional Delegation for their support of our application in what was a very competitive nationwide process.\" Loan amounts can range from a minimum of $250,000 up to a maximum of $2,500,000. MARBIDCO will charge a below-market fixed interest rate of 4% and will work cooperatively with borrowers on establishing other appropriate loan terms and conditions.An equity contribution of at least 7.5% of a project's total cost is required by the borrower (which can be matched dollar-for-dollar with a grant, not to exceed 10% of the project's total cost). The available equity grant match is coming from special funds appropriated to MARBIDCO by the State of Maryland to help enhance livestock processing capacity and cut down on long wait times.Further information and the program application form is available on MARBIDCO's website: www. marbidco.org. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CONNIE CONNOLLY\n \nBlue catfish fillets await skinning at the only USDA processing facility on the Eastern Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That image in each of us is the basis of our worth.\nSadly, each of us are also broken by sin, that image having been marred in us all. We cannot point a finger in condemnation at those different from us because we are all guilty of selfishness, wanting our own way rather than selflessly living for others. The line between good and evil is not between categories in which we try to separate ourselves from others; it runs down each individual human heart.\nWe know this because, if we are honest, each of us are capable of acts of great kindness or great wickedness. None of us are guiltless.\nYet, the good news, the Gospel says that God in His love has given each of us a chance to experience that love and to have that image restored in us. When we accept what God in Jesus Christ has done for us, turn from living as we once did, and believe in Him, then His restoration process begins. He makes us into a brand new person, with the desire to do the good that our world needs.\nWe are given the chance to be human the way God intended by enjoying a personal relationship with Him and showing His love to everyone.\nThe good news that can bring healing and peace to everyone is that everyone is equally a sinner and, at the same time, everyone is equally loved. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is a mother, she is working on a doctorate in education and she was recently appointed as president of the Preston Commissioners.And, she has just cut the ribbon on her new business support services building.\nWinston has turned a 3,900-square-foot old bank into a multifaceted space to incubate other businesses.\n\"We do administrative support services. So part of that is to offer the business center services, you can come in and get your copies made, fax, scan, notary,\" Winston said. She also offers call center services and tax returns.\nHer business's name is Van Tech Business Solutions. With it, she hopes to provide support to other local entrepreneurs.\nThe chamber of commerce has been a huge support in her efforts, Winston said, along with her friends, family and other community members.\n\"Tracy Snyder, director, she led the ribbon cutting ceremony. The whole community was there. People came from near and far. I had family that traveled in, and I had other businesswomen that traveled from the western shore to come over in support. My bishop was here to bless the building,\" she said.\nEntrepreneurs see potential where others just drive by, Winston said. She is hoping to employ five people.\n\"That was one of the goals behind purchasing this property. As well as carrying out the vision of the mayor to bring economic development to the town. For so long this building was vacant. It has been a great six months of development,\" she said.\nShe reached out to the Maryland Capital Enterprise Women's Business Center in Salisbury to get help with her loan.

If you have a business, don't be afraid,\" Winston said.\nWinston has a lot of space. Her own business needs only require about ¼ of the whole footprint. She plans to rent out the remaining space to long-term tenants as well as offer desks and office space for short-term business needs.\nShe has two renters already. One is Elegant Affairs event planning service and the other is Eternal Love Cleaning Service. There will also be a musical organ repairman, who will have his showroom in the back. She wants to open her front lot to food trucks.\n\"If you work from home or remotely, you can just come in and work in a different space or meet a client here. I also have more private office space you can rent by the day. Just go on my website and reserve your space for the day — you have a furnished office,\" she said.\nShe knows this will bring more businesses to town, another one of her goals, both as a businessperson and as a local elected official.\n\"If you want to see more businesses come to town, you have to lead the way,\" she said. \"...

In 1680, a new town and Christ Church were moved to the new town of Broad Creek, where Bay City is now. Then, in 1880, Christ Church was moved to the new town of Stevensville.\nThe new Christ Church was built in 1880 in Queen Anne style. The bell tower is in the \"lancet\" chimney style. Wooden pegs and bricks were reused from the earlier Christ Churches. Historic Christ Church recently was designated as the Arts & Cultural Center of Historic Stevensville.\nMike Thomas has researched the church bell. The bell was made in 1880 by the McShane Bell Foundry of Baltimore, America's oldest bell company, established in 1856. The bell is bronze, rings in C sharp, and weighs 400 pounds including the mountings. In 1880, the bell was shipped to the Rev. Thompson, Christ Church, Stevensville. Church bells are rung for religious and ceremonial purposes such as Christmas and for significant events such as weddings.\nDonations also are needed for Christ Church upkeep. Checks may be sent to: Nancy M. Cook, 124 Bryce Road, Queenstown, MD 21658. Historic Christ Church is nonprofit organization registered with the state of Maryland. Donations are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "World War II veteran celebrates 100th birthday\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1226\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Private First Class Kernie Thompson's nickname was \"Young Boy\" when he served overseas in the U.S. Army's 599th Ordnance Ammunition Company during World War II.That's because Thompson, at age 18, was the youngest of the 40 soldiers assigned to that all-African-American unit when he joined in 1943, the start of a two-year stint in which fought alongside his comrades in England, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.\nOn Wednesday (Jan. 15), that veteran once known as Young Boy celebrated his 100th birthday, a milestone marked by a party in the Community Living Center at the Perry Point VA Medical Center, where the Baltimore native has resided since 2020.\nThere were party hats, lots of balloons, a beautiful birthday cake and Thompson's favorite candy — Hershey's Kisses, which he calls \"silver bells.\" The party room was packed with people, including Thompson's fellow veteran residents, VA staff and members of his church family.\nAmong the party guests were Army officials, including Maj. General John Cushing, who is the Commanding General; and U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command Sgt. Major Brian Haydt.\nThompson reportedly was his usual upbeat self during the party. Thompson relies on a wheelchair and is \"not able to eat regular by mouth,\" but he remains \"sharp as a tack\" mentally, one longtime friend described. The new Centenarian has outlived his children and his friends from childhood and young adulthood.\nAlso at the party was the woman Thompson married more than 40 years ago, Clarice Thompson, his second wife, whom he nicknamed \"Reesey.\" Thompson reportedly gets excited whenever he hears her name or learns that \"Reesey\" has come to visit him.\n\"He is the love of my life,\" Clarice said, before referencing his necessary VA residency and remarking, \"I miss him, but I know that he is where he is suppose to be.\"\nThompson is soft-spoken and is strong in his Christian faith, according to a few party attendees who were interviewed.\nHe served more than 40 years as the chaplain at the oldest African-American owned and operated nursing home in the state, Maryland Baptist Aged Home in Baltimore, where he volunteered once a week.\nA longtime member of a city Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon until age 94, Thompson also was active for more than 40 years in the Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore. In addition, Thompson provided usher, or deacon, training to parishioners throughout Maryland and other states, as part of an usher ministry associated with another one of the faith-based groups that he served.\n\"He's the kind of man who walks humbly and talks humbly. When he speaks, you listen,\" Clarice said. \"He's the kind of man I would recommend any young people to just take a photograph of him in their mind and take on some of his characteristics — other than Jesus' characteristics.\"\nClarice added, \"Not only was he disciplined in the military, he's a disciplined man as he walks with God.\"\nOne of the party attendees, Joseph Miller, president of that Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore, and his wife have been friends with Thompson and Clarice for more than 30 years.\n\"He is a wonderful guy. His smile is what gets you. He seems like a quiet person. His mannerism is quiet until you start talking to him. He's powerful. He talks softly, but carries a big stick,\" Miller commented with a chuckle. \"He loves to talk.\"\nAlong those lines, Thompson's favorite topic of discussion: The Bible.\n\"He loves the word of God, and he will share it with you. When I come here to the VA center and talk to the residents, they always tell me what he taught them about the word of God,\" Miller said.\nAfter retiring from his career as a Baltimore City maintenance worker, Thompson worked as an usher during Baltimore Orioles home games. He had that gig for three decades and was quite popular among spectators and all employees in the Baltimore Orioles organization.\n\"I was there when he got his 30-year ring, and he was proud of that (ring). They knew him well at the Baltimore Orioles, from the general manager, the manager, the players, the vendors, the mascot, and they all loved Kernie Thompson,\" Miller said.\nAn only child with an interest in woodworking, Thompson entered the U.S. Army at the tender age of 18 in 1943. Defending this country during World War II is among the many admirable contributions Thompson has made during his 100 years on this earth, thus far.\nThompson left his parents' West Baltimore home and traveled to Georgia, where he completed basic training. The military then sent Thompson to Camp Breckinridge in Kentucky, where he was put in the Army's 599th Ordnance Ammunition Company, which saw combat action after its deployment to Europe.\nDuring a Cecil Whig interview two years ago, Thompson recalled, \"Being overseas at war was a great experience, but some days were pleasant and some days were scary.\"\nThe following is an excerpt of some of the World War II remembrances Thompson shared during that interview:\nThompson noted that he enjoyed talking to not only his fellow soldiers, but citizens of the countries they were deployed to about their life and what it was like living in their country.\n\"They would ask about the United States and we would ask about their country and we would always talk to the people, we had a good relationship,\" Thompson said. \"With the soldiers, we would play cards and everyone always had something to say to make you laugh.\"\nBut when Thompson and his fellow soldiers weren't playing cards, telling jokes or talking with citizens, they were receiving ordnance shipments, supplying soldiers with ammunition and exercising their knowledge from basic training — something Thompson said his survival was contingent upon.\n\"What they teach you is important to your life, especially in combat,\" said Thompson. \"Your life might depend on what you were taught in basic training.\"\nThompson recalled that that training saved his life late one night in 1944, when his company was waiting for the arrival of a munitions shipment. After his group laid down to rest before the shipment arrived, they were awakened by the sight of enemy flares falling from the skies.\nAccording to Thompson, flares were used to illuminate areas at night so planes and infantry could properly identify enemy soldiers, weaponry and other valuable targets — such as the ammunition holds that Thompson's unit was responsible for.\n\"Basic training taught us that when they drop flares, don't move and turn your face to the ground,\" said Thompson. \"If you look up, the planes could see the glare of your face and it could mess up the dilation of your eyes. It was a scary night.\"\nIn 1945, after two years of his service, Thompson — who was then 21 — received word that the war was over.\n\"When we heard the war was over, it was a big joy,\" Thompson said. \"We shouted and we celebrated. When I got back, the first thing I did was go with my mother to see my grandmother and we had a nice dinner and celebrated.\"\nFollowing the war, Thompson got married, had a daughter and worked.\nReflecting on his wartime military service, Thompson commented, \"Being a part of the Army and serving my county was one of the most rewarding things because I felt like I was fulfilling a duty that I owed to my country and it makes me feel good,\"\nThompson then remarked, \"I am a blessed man to be here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But he did. And with horrific injuries. One leg was completely severed, the other left hanging by a thread - and he suffered third-degree burns all over his back.What followed were 26 surgeries, a second amputation of the leg that could not be saved, unspeakable depression, fear and uncertainty.In the blink of an eye, Scott's life changed from one with a bright college career ahead to one of unbearable challenges, dashed dreams and poverty.What kind of 18-wheeler has run you off the road of life? Is it unemployment?Divorce? Health issues?Whatever it is that has cut the legs out from under your financial situation, it's time for you to get up out of that recliner!Lost your home? Stop wallowing in self-pity. Pick yourself up and start looking for a landlord.Can't find a job? Maybe it's time to become your own next employer.Whatever it is that is keeping you deep in debt and a victim of a rotten economy, stop giving it power to hold you down!Give up looking in the rearview mirror of your life. What happened then is over now. It's done and there is nothing you can do to change it.You are stronger than you know and smarter than you think.

By the time they arrived, the fire was too advanced to hear any smoke detectors, McCarter said.\nThe call came in to dispatchers as a working porch fire, which quickly spread to the rest of the home. McCarter said the fire took about an hour to put out.\nMcCarter said the Red Cross is working with the residents who were displaced by the fire while the fire marshal's investigation is underway.\n\"Support your local volunteers,\" McCarter said. \"Smoke detectors save lives.\"\nOnce the fire was extinguished, the Rescue Fire Company purchased 20 pizzas from Carmela's Cucina. Carmela Lakovic provides officers, firefighters and EMS a discounted rate of 20%. \"They're heroes, and I thank every one of them for risking their lives for us,\" Lakovic said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Solar energy should not trample town's master plan\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVE KLINE | Section: Columns \n \n 871\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My love for the Chesapeake's Eastern Shore started in Chestertown.I used to visit each fall for the Chestertown Wildlife Exhibition and Sale, and it was one of my favorite weekends of the year — skeins of migrating Canada geese passing noisily overhead, a little bit of autumn in the air. That celebration of wildlife art was a fixture on Chestertown's fall calendar from 1965 to 2012, and it was my first exposure to the magic of Chestertown.\nAs with so many Eastern Shore towns, that magic comes from the close interplay of vista and village. Just a stone's throw from your favorite bookstore, you can enjoy the rural countryside in full by paddling Radcliffe Creek, cycling a scenic byway or photographing combines as they bring in the harvest.\nAround the same time I was making those trips to Chestertown, not quite 20 years ago, the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy was working with Chestertown, Kent County and a professional planning firm to create the Chestertown Greenbelt Master Plan. The master plan was meant to encompass the future of the Clarke-Hopewell Farm, described by Chestertown Mayor David Foster as \"our only real opportunity for expansion of Chestertown.\"\nThe nearly 500-acre farm, northeast of Chestertown's historic downtown, is one of the last remaining sizeable undeveloped tracts within the town's planning boundary.\nThis was just before the Great Recession. Real estate was booming, and there were plenty of questions about how development would shape the future of Chestertown and the entire Eastern Shore. Hence the master plan, developed with strong input from the community, to ensure that future development of the Clarke-Hopewell Farm would be an \"organic extension of the historic fabric of the town,\" an effort to replicate in Chestertown's future what had worked so well in its past.\nOne of the questions asked at the inevitable community workshops during the process: \"What defines the character of Chestertown and should be reflected in this new part of town?\"\nResponses included: \"historic … small town feeling … neighborhood feel … walkable … life on a human scale.\" Those words do a nice job describing what works about Chestertown. The master plan hews closely to these ideas, providing a flexible and iterative development program designed to \"accommodate much of the growth of the town and the county over the next 50–100 years.\" The plan includes hamlets and villages, each of which incorporates mixed-use buildings, civic uses and neighborhood greens.\nBut instead of human-scale hamlets and mixed-use neighborhoods, what now seems poised to occupy the Clarke-Hopewell Farm is a 45-megawatt utility-scale solar array. The array will send power straight to the grid, keeping lights on and computers buzzing in homes and businesses and data centers as far away as Illinois. And all of this has been planned despite clear and formal opposition from Chestertown and Kent County.\nThis change came about because the solar developer, a subsidiary of a massive Canadian-based asset management company, petitioned for and was granted a certificate of public convenience and need from the state of Maryland. What does that mean? Well, it's essentially a permission slip from the state, allowing the solar developer to simply ignore time-tested and well-understood local land use decisions.\nThis \"preemption,\" as it's called, is being done in the spirit of addressing the challenge of climate change head-on, for which the state has adopted aggressive renewable energy generation goals. But in its rush to site solar power, the state has tilted the playing field. Parcels close to our towns and designated growth areas deserve careful attention, responsible land use and close examination.\nIn Chestertown's case, the state is trampling the town's best-laid plans and taking off the table a parcel that was meant to accommodate well-planned growth for the next 50 years or more. Instead of public parks, community orchards, apartments that young people can afford and easily bike from — instead of trees, a café, playgrounds, gardens, a barbershop or cottages — we'll have solar panel, solar panel, solar panel. More than 140,000 modules.\nSolar panels do not need fertile soil. They do not need to have their hair cut and they do not bike to class in the morning. There are many other places solar fields can go. Where else is Chestertown supposed to go? There are not many other spaces the rest of Chestertown can grow into. At least not without contributing to what the Greenbelt Master Plan describes as the Eastern Shore's \"auto-oriented suburban sprawl, which threatens to erode its rural character.\"\nIn the race to site solar power as quickly as possible, the Eastern Shore looks increasingly attractive. But we must have balance, a level playing field, some way to say, \"Here or here, but not there.\"\nMany of our open acres are best at producing food, and they should remain in agriculture. Other acres, located nearest our towns, are best suited for new neighborhoods. Some spots are well-suited for solar generation. But when we write a new set of rules that favor solar energy over all other land uses, there is no balance.\nRather than allowing Chestertown to \"grow harmoniously … slowly and methodically as to maximize the efficiency of its land use,\" as the Greenbelt Master Plan so eloquently states, we will allow our land to be \"rapidly digested.\" The Eastern Shore will lose. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Governor Aruna Miller greeted leaders of the Queen Anne's County Democratic Party for a short meet and greet before speaking to the awaiting audience of supporters.\"We have our work cut out for us,\" said Frank Alduino, member of the Democratic Central Committee in QA, when asked how support for the Democrats was faring.The Queen Anne's County Democratic Central Committee held what will now be their annual Unity Dinner, at the Center on Saturday evening, Oct. 14, providing Democrats across the county and state the opportunity to meet.Jordan Himes, political director for the Maryland Democratic Party, attended the event to \"make sure we get as unified as we can as Democrats.\" {p class=\"p2\"}In his introduction of Miller, Himes, whose grandmother is from the Eastern Shore and attended school in the Kennard Center, site of the former Kennard High School, said he was brought up knowing that you can never have the absence of hope.\"I encourage everyone here to use your voice,\" said Himes. \"One voice can change one person, a person can change the county, the county can change the state, the state can change the country, and the country can change the world.\" In 2022, Maryland saw the most diverse ticket that's ever won in the history of Maryland. Miller thanked the audience for their support of the Moore/Miller ticket which won by the most votes in Maryland's history, and they were the only two people of color who ever won the office together in the United States.Miller told the audience they didn't vote for the Moore/Miller ticket to be the status quo. \"You all wanted us to move boldly, decisively, and deliberately for all Marylanders. You elected us to leave no one left behind.\" Miller assured the crowd they had heard the voices of rural voters who told them that the only time they saw elected officials was during a campaign year. Because of this, Miller says, Governor Moore has decided to coordinate a tour bus of his entire cabinet to travel to every Maryland county and listen to the concerns of voters.Touting the success of the legislative session, Miller said the administration worked on raising the minimum wage; increasing services to Maryland veterans; providing high school seniors with a year-long, postgrad service option; increasing broadband services in rural areas; and ensuring training for abortion care providers.\"Things don't just happen, they are made to happen,\" said Miller. \"We are fighting for equity and freedom. Let's all heal the world and make it a better place.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nLt.

    "content": "Grasonville proposal looks to develop farmland for infill affordable housing\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 679\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GRASONVILLE — A proposed water and sewer amendment to supply a potential affordable housing development in Grasonville gained support during a public hearing Dec. 10.The proposal is to amend the property's water and sewer services to accommodate the development of 72 townhomes and 218 single family lots.\nLocated at 5400 Main Street, Aspire at Ewing Farm is a 112 acre property currently used for agriculture and is zoned Grasonville Planned Residential Neighborhood.\nFlows from use are anticipated to be 72,500 gallons per day. Sewer service would be provided via a constructed gravity sewer pump station and water service would he provided by the Grasonville water system.\nSketch plan approval for the project was granted by the Queen Anne's County Planning Commission in October and met requirements of the Water and Sewer Master Plan.\nThe property has been part of the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan for a 10 year service since 2011, according to attorney Joe Stevens on behalf of developer K. Hovnanian.\nThe property has been ratified as part of the Grasonville Growth Area and zoned for planned residential development for decades.\nThe 2022 Comprehensive Plan highlights affordable housing as a high need in the county.\nAccording to Mike Irons, division president of K. Hovnanian Homes of Maryland, LLC the Aspire Development will include \"efficient homes without a lot of bells and whistles,\" aimed toward first time home buyers, workforce housing and affordable housing.\n\"We're bringing to the market something that the county needs,\" Irons said.\nK. Hovnanian is also the builder and developer for the 55 and older Four Seasons Community.\nBarry Griffith, planner with Lane Engineering, noted the location is an infill property surrounded by existing houses, schools and parks.\n\"We're a hole in a donut of development around us, and that's where we want new growth to go,\" Griffith said.\nThe property is located in a priority funding area, meaning the state and county have both acknowledged it as appropriate for state funding for future growth, he said.\nMember of the Ewing family Mitchell Andrew noted the Ewings have been approached by local, regional and national developers over the years and \"without a doubt\" K. Hovnanian was the first that \"really fit Grasonville,\" and met the needs of the county.\nThe public hearing saw over 10 in-person as well as six emails from residents voicing support for the amendment to move the development forward with resounding sentiment toward the county's need for affordable housing.\nAgreeing the project met the needs of the county, Commission President Jim Moran noted the loose terminology of affordable housing that could change in the potentially two years before the development is ready.\nFollowing potential commissioner amendment approval for sewer and water redesignation, the project would then move forward for additional approvals including site plan, subdivision and, Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance.\nA public hearing was also held to consider amending the Queen Anne's County 2011 Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan for Barnstable Lowery Farm's proposed development of 82 townhomes on a 11 acre lot in Main Street Chester.\nThe property is agricultural land consisting of two farms on either side of the three improved properties that are not included in the development proposal. The proposed development is part of Lowery Farm and Dream Farm. The portion adjacent to Main Street is zoned Town Center and the parcel to the rear of the site is zoned Countryside.\nAll residential development will occur in the Town Center zoning district.\nSewer services would be provided by Vacuum Sewer Collection Station 'G' and water services would be provided by the Stevensville/Chester water system.\nFlows from the use are anticipated at 20,500 gallons per day.\nThe Planning Commission granted concept plan approval for the Barnstable Townhouse development in October and no anticipated off-site sewer or water infrastructure issues are associated with this proposal.\nAt public comment, Tracy Schulz, on behalf of Dream Farm ownership, spoke in favor of the project, citing the development appropriate for the area.\nOne email voiced concern for future developments' impact on water and sewer services on Kent Island, Grasonville, and Queenstown, and recommended posting projected usage numbers.\nPublic comment is still being accepted and a commissioner vote is expected at the Jan. 14 meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Not long after that, the Queen Anne's junior pinned Northern Calvert's Emily Boling — ranked No. 1 in the state at the time — at the annual Queen of the Jungle tournament.\n\"She's been amazing all year,\" Queen Anne's head coach John Waters said of Watson. \"She took fourth at Beast of the East and lost to the number two-ranked girl in the nation, 2-0.\"\nWatson continued her impressive first-year roll last Friday night on her home mat, winning the 235-pound title during the girls Class 2A-1A East Regional tournament at Queen Anne's.\n\"She's very athletic,\" Waters said of Watson, who heads into Thursday's 2A-1A state tournament at the Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro as the top-ranked wrestler at 235 pounds in the state. \"So she can do things that other heavyweights can't do. That gives her a big advantage. And she's strong.\"\nWatson (21-2) pinned Stephen Decatur's Amelia Gonzalez in 40 seconds in the semifinals before winning the championship final via a medical forfeit, joining senior Ally Conley as Queen Anne's only regional champs.\nA two-time state champion, Conley (20-6) became the school's first four-time regional champ — male or female — when she battled off her back twice before earning a pin over Stephen Decatur freshman Calleigh McBride 34 seconds into the second period of the 100-pound championship bout.\n\"Ally's experience comes in and she doesn't panic when she's gets on her back,\" Waters said. \"Being the first four-time regional champion from Queen Anne's County is pretty special.\"\nConley and Watson will have plenty of company in Upper Marlboro, as the defending state champion Lions qualified wrestlers in 11 of the 14 weight classes. In addition to Watson, Faith Connolly (2nd, 145), Annalise Michael (3rd, 105), Adyson Kendall (3rd, 120), Emmy Falcone (3rd, 125) and Linda Vail (3rd, 135) all qualified for states for the first time. They will be joined by Lilly Hammond (2nd, 140), Adelina Dickens (3rd, 155), Maggie Rooney (2nd, 170) and Kaylynn Bryant (2nd, 190).\nUnlike the boys state tournament, where the top four from each weight class in the four regions qualify for states, only the top three girls advance to states. Queen Anne's Michael, Kendall, Falcone, Vail and Dickens each had to wrestle back and win their respective consolation final to qualify.\n\"Those girls, they knew that,\" Waters said. \"So after their first loss of the night they knew they had to battle back. And they did. Addy Dickens had to wrestle a girl who pinned her earlier in the night.\n\"I sent them all messages after we got done cleaning up the mats,\" Waters continued. \"Just told them how proud I was of them, because most of the girls missed at least two practices last week due to sickness. It was rough. We only had five girls at Monday's and Tuesday's practice, and they weren't the same five. For them to battle back and just, one, get their bodies ready to be able to compete, and then for some of them to lose their first match and wrestle back. It's been an awesome ride.\"\nWho's going: Here's a list of other North Bayside wrestlers who qualified for the state tournament. The top three in each weight class qualify. Wrestlers are listed by school, their place at regionals, and weight class.\nCambridge-South Dorchester: Sienna Mitchell (2nd, 235); Colonel Richardson: Landine Dorleans (2nd, 120); Olivia McGregor (3rd, 140); Easton: Leah Gonzalez-Reyes (3rd, 110); Zelia Proa (2nd, 125); Thanh Mai Pham (3rd, 130); Khadija Popal (3rd, 170); North Caroline: Yelana Torres-Guzman (3rd, 235). \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore is recommending an increase in Maryland's capital gains tax and an increase in the personal income tax. In each instance, the increase will only be for higher levels of income. Of course, such a tax will primarily affect those with the largest stake in the state's economy.In contrast, Canada's new prime minister recently announced he will not propose or support an increase in Canada's capital gains tax. While this may not seem especially perspicacious since the Canadian capital gains rate is already at 50%, it certainly does recognize a limit to what is economically sensible. It's wishful thinking but would be nice, therefore, if Canada's experience helped educate Gov. Moore and Maryland about the pitfalls of pushing the private sector too far.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She has a bird feeder on her back porch where she can watch all different kinds of birds fly in.\nBorn in Hobbs, Maryland, Lord is the youngest of 11 children. She can recall when her family moved from Baltimore to Hobbs.\n\"My mother and father lived in Baltimore, and they came down before the new bridge was built; they had a ferry that came across,\" Lord said. \"... My great-grandfather enlisted my dad in the Spanish-American War. So while he was in the war fighting, he came home on a weekend and married my mother who lived in Baltimore, and they both lived with my great-grandfather.\n\"My great-grandfather saw an advertisement in the paper, and it was advertising Hobbs, Maryland; they had a position open for a worker. Well, right away my great grandfather thought, 'Well, that's a good job for his son.' So they applied, and he got the job, that's how they got down here to Hobbs. They supplied a home for them to live in, and he took care of them.\"\nLord graduated from high school in 1943. She met her husband, Malcolm Lord, through her older brother. Malcolm graduated two years before Lord did, and she wrote letters to Malcolm during the time he was in World War II. When Malcolm came back, he married Lord in 1948.\nLord and her husband had four kids, five grandkids, seven great-grand kids and lived in Denton their whole life.\nRight after high school, Lord began working at a bank in town for about three weeks, then after a conversation with the owner, she began working at Townsends.\nAfter working at Townsends for seven years, Lord opened her own florist shop that was attached to her home in Denton.\nAfter closing her florist shop, Lord worked for Caroline County Board of Education until she retired in 1986.\nLord's advice to a husband and wife having kids is to \"think first.\"\n\"Think first about how your life is going to change completely,\" Lord said. \"You just have to grow either with it or forget it. Most of them are forgetting it and getting divorces.\"\nAlthough her age comes with a lot of wisdom, Lord regrets how forgetful she is at her age.\n\"The worst is is your forgetfulness,\" Lord said. \"You really regret that you can't remember a lot of the things that were so important to you two years ago that now you forget about them.\"\nLord's advice to anybody going through life is to \"do your own thing and decide what you want to do with your life and pursue it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hignutt and Simmons explained multiple numbers within their budget including increasing administrators salaries to become competitive with neighboring counties. The commissioners also discussed Lockerman Middle School and the potential new location. Simmons said the Board of Education will keep a close working relationship with the commissioners throughout the process.Lori Bishop and Charlotte Brown provided an update on the addition to 4-H Park. The addition is almost complete, but the bathrooms failed inspection due to sinks being too tall and toilets being to far from the wall.Daniel Fox discussed Opioid Settlement Fund with the county commissioners. The county received $358,000 in local direct payments and $515,000 in target aid grants for opioid settlement. The county plans to talk with other departments and agencies to see how the fund will properly assist on a one-time basis.The county conducted the second reading and public hearing for an emergency bill on wastewater treatment facilities. The bill will allow for non-accessory wastewater treatment facilities to be permitted by special use exception, provided the facilities hold MDE discharge permits for five years and the proposed application is similar to the previous application. The Planning Commission had a positive recommendation. The commissioners moved the discussion to a third reading at their next meeting.During the county administration report, Kathleen Freeman told the commissioners about a conversation she had with Robbie Gill about a new YMCA in Caroline County. The commissioners are adamant about getting a new YMCA in Caroline County and believe the conversations need to turn into building. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Meeting, discussions at Cambridge YMCA heat up\n\n June 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jim Johnson jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 1318\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The gym was hot. Not unbearably hot, but close enough.Members of the Pauline F. and W. David Robbins Family YMCA in Cambridge filed into the gym on a blistering hot day to hear about plans for a new YMCA from the Y's leadership.\n\"Welcome to the world's largest sauna,\" somebody said as people picked up a bottle of water the Y provided for attendees.\nHundreds attended. Many of them were hot — not just because of the heat in the gym — but because they had heard about plans to move the YMCA to the proposed Cambridge Harbor site that is being developed by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.\nThey liked the Y right where it is on Talbot Avenue in Cambridge.\nAt the microphone was Robbie Gill. Much of the crowd's heat was directed at Gill, who is the CEO of the YMCA of the Chesapeake, the organization that oversees and runs not just the Cambridge Y but the 11 Eastern Shore YMCAs from Elkton in Cecil County to Pokomoke City and Salsibury on the Lower Shore.\nI must say, Gill was cool. He was chill. People were angry, and they let him know it. I didn't see him sweating. He patiently answered questions after the crowd moved from the hot gym to the better air-conditioned lobby.\nLet's say that a good part of the problem was self-inflicted.\nThe meeting was held less than two weeks after an email was sent out by the YMCA of the Chesapeake that led people to believe the organization had reached a deal with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. to build a new YMCA on the Cambridge Harbor site.\nBoth Gill and CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard told the Star Democrat after that email landed in members in boxes that there is no such deal to build on Cambridge Harbor at this time.\nThe YMCA is advocating the need to build a new YMCA, Gill said in his interview with Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato. He said the existing site is not sustainable over the next two decades and can't provide certain programs, amenities and services.\nHe repeated that at the meeting with Cambridge Y members last Tuesday. I am not sure he changed many minds at the meeting.\nGill gave a presentation on a market study that tested three different sites for a new Cambridge YMCA facility. Two representatives from Triangle2, the firm that completed the market study, presented with Gill.\nThe three sites tested in the market study were the current YMCA location on Talbot Avenue near Gerry Boyle Park, Cambridge Harbor and a parcel on the corner of Maple Dam Road and Route 16, which is near Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nTriangle2 CEO Lori Swann said 814 households were interviewed for the market study.\nSwann said the current site and Maple Dam Road site did not test as well as the Cambridge Harbor site did.\nAccording to the presentation, 73% of the interviewed county residents that were interested in joining the YMCA would be \"very likely\" to participate in a YMCA at Cambridge Harbor. The presentation showed that 61% felt that way about the current location and 42% felt that way about the Maple Dam Road site.\nGill said the market study made it clear that the community is in need of amenities that the current facility cannot provide.\nDuring the question and answer portion of the meeting, member Phil Reed said his impression from the meeting was that Gill and the YMCA are sold on the waterfront site.\nKathy Abend, who has been a member of the YMCA for several years, said in an interview that she didn't think Gill seemed open to rebuilding on the current site.\n\"He was shutting this down,\" she said.\nFor the record, my wife and I are members of the Cambridge YMCA and work out there daily. We walk from our home to the facility, which we would not be able to do if the Y moved to Cambridge Harbor.\nWith that said, there are good reasons to build a new facility, and statistics from Y's elsewhere on the Eastern Shore support the contention that new facilities result in increased membership. Gill repeatedly brought up the experience in Chestertown, where a new facility resulted in a huge increase in membership, far exceeding projections when that project was started.\nGill also mentioned donors who have pledged the millions of dollars it will take to construct a new facility in Cambridge. Donor dollars are essential to a successful project..\nPart of the problem the YMCA faces is its association with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. That organization has been shrouded in secrecy, secrecy that worries many in Cambridge that deals made behind closed doors may not be in the best interest of the town and its tax-paying residents.\nWhile CWDI has shown more openness since Angie Hengst became president of the board this year, there is wariness dealing with the organization. You could see that wariness in the questions asked at the Cambridge Y meeting last week.\nProbably the biggest fear — which may be unfounded but is still a fear — is that a backroom deal has been reached between the two organizations for the development of the Talbot Avenue YMCA property following a move of the facility to Cambridge Harbor.\n\"There has not been talk of a deal with the YMCA,\" CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard said in an interview with reporter Maggie Trovato earlier this month, adding that the two groups do have conversations from time to time about the YMCA's interest in being a part of the project to develop space along the Choptank River.\nLeonard said CWDI has had those kinds of conversations with multiple respondents of a July 2022 request for proposals. The YMCA was one of the respondents to that request.\nThe June 7 email the YMCA sent out included a \"facility update\" about banners the organization is replacing at its current Cambridge location on Talbot Avenue.\n\"As we work to highlight all the positives that come with building a new Robbins Family Y at Cambridge Harbor, we wanted to give you a sneak peak of the new banners,\" the email reads.\nAfter the email was sent out, people on social media shared concerns about the YMCA's plans. Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods President Chuck McFadden said in an interview that when he saw the email, he was \"taken aback,\" and he said the news was \"buried\" in an email about banners.\nGill, who has received emails and phone calls from concerned residents since the email went out, said the YMCA is advocating the need to build a new YMCA. He said the existing site is not sustainable over the next two decades and can't provide certain programs, amenities and services.\n\"We are trying to help frame a narrative because, right now, you have other people that are framing narratives that are just wrong,\" he said.\nMy opinion: I think the YMCA of Chesapeake should look closer at building new facilities on the existing site. In previous communities where I have been an editor, I have seen voters defeat bonds for new school buildings but then come back and approve bonds for projects where additions were built on to existing buildings.\nThe existing Cambridge YMCA is on 7 acres and offers space for sports fields and community gardens. Those would not be available with a move to Cambridge Harbor.\nAt the same time, a Cambridge Harbor location would be closer to U.S. Route 50 and would attract members from North Dorchester County and areas east of Cambridge, members who would not be interested in the current location deep in town.\nI think either location with added amenities would attract members. It would be easier to build on a new location while keeping the existing facility operational, but with planning, the same thing could be accomplished at the existing location.\nMembers need to keep an open mind about a Cambridge Harbor location. At the same time, YMCA leaders need to listen to the concerns of its existing membership.\nJim Johnson is the executive editor of The Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council president candidates speak out against sign vandalism\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 460\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Candidates for Town Council president are speaking out against recent sign vandalism ahead of Easton's May 6 election.In a letter to police Thursday, current President Frank Gunsallus said he was notified that a swastika was placed on one of his campaign signs at the corner of South Aurora Street and South Lane. He said that came after \"significant vandalism\" of a number of his other signs.\n\"This act of hate has escalated the situation into a deeply troubling reality that demands our collective attention,\" Gunsallus wrote.\nDon Abbatiello, the current Ward 2 representative running against Gunsallus for the presidential seat, said theft and vandalism do not belong in the town's elections.\nIn an interview Friday, Abbatiello said he informed Gunsallus of the defaced sign after discovering it while campaigning in town Wednesday.\n\"We obviously disagree on some issues, we're running against each other, but there's no reason to deface people's property,\" Abbatiello said. \"There's no reason to bring hatred into this at all. We are still a community. We're still neighbors. We should act like it.\"\nGunsallus contacted the Easton Police Department after seeing the South Aurora Street sign. He also says campaign signs have been stolen from his home.\nAbbatiello says a few of his signs have gone missing as well, though he's unsure if they were stolen or blew away due to wind.\nInterim Town Manager Alan Lowrey, Easton's police chief, said an investigation into the defaced sign on South Aurora Street is underway. Lowrey told The Star Democrat that as for missing signs, some were taken down by town code enforcers due to violating town code.\nPolitical sign violations include too many signs on one property or signs placed in a public right-of-way, Lowrey said. To avoid confusion moving forward, Lowrey has asked code enforcement to notify him of any signs not within the code so he can contact the candidate.\nLowrey says he's reached out to both Abbatiello and Gunsallus regarding signs that need to be moved or removed due to town code. Both candidates have complied, Lowrey noted.\nGunsallus and Abbatiello each denounced sign vandalism and acts of hatred.\n\"These types of things shouldn't happen during a campaign,\" Gunsallus wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat. \"However, I'm hopeful this can be a turning point for our town to come together, reject hate, and foster love in its place.\"\n\"We're a community, we all live here together,\" Abbatiello said. \"We need to get along with one another. And bringing in things like that, totally uncalled for.\"\nEaston Police Department Sgt. Patrick Sally says stealing or defacing political signs are criminal offenses. He emphasized that many homeowners and businesses have security technology, such as Ring cameras, that can help identify those stealing or defacing signs.\n\"You're going to pay the price if you're caught,\" Sally said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton looking to go deep\n\n September 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 984\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The 2023 high school football season wasn't the best of times for Easton High.Starting wide receiver Chase Raab was lost before the preseason. Quarterback Mikey O'Connor suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2. That injury list eventually ballooned to seven offensive starters, not exactly a recipe for a deep postseason run.\nSo head coach Matt Griffith inserted his younger players, hoping they would gain the experience needed to help the Warriors turn things around in 2024.\nAnd what a turnaround it was.\nAll Easton did last season was go from a 1-8 in 2023 to 8-4, the biggest about-face in the program's past 40 years. That turnaround included a pair of playoff victories, the first time the Warriors had done anything like that in at least 40 years.\n\"We had a good year,\" said Griffith, who finished with the highest win total in his 10 years at the helm, and earned his 50th career victory when Easton defeated Kent Island in the second round of the Class 2A East Regional playoffs.\nNow, Griffith and company want more.\n\"We're not going to rest on what we did last year,\" said Griffith, whose team joins Kent Island and Queen Anne's in the move from Class 2A to the 2A-1A ranks this season. \"And while that was a successful season for some, we're going to choose success (based on) playing in the first week of December. If you're not going into the season thinking you want to play in the state championship game, then you got to change your mindset. We want to be better than we were last year.\"\nEaston graduated seven seniors from last year, including O'Connor — now at Merrimack (Mass.) College — but return 17.\nFor the first time since 2018, an O'Connor will not start the season at quarterback for Easton. Brady Walls, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound junior who backed up Mikey O'Connor last season, takes control of an offense that looks solid at every spot.\n\"Size. Strong arm. High IQ,\" Griffith said of Walls. \"He's a competitor. So he's going to put us in a good place. He's done a good job so far managing the offense in the preseason, and we're looking forward to hopefully a big junior year from him.\"\nGriffith is also hoping to get some big games from his backfield, led by senior Dustin Blue (5-10, 212), sophomore Jamiere Copper (5-9, 200) and junior Jordan Horsey (5-11, 210).\n\"Physical, downhill runners,\" Griffith said. \"We relied a lot on the running game last year with Mikey and a combination of the running backs. I think the running backs will take more of the running load this year. That's not saying Brady won't (run). But Brady won't run as much as Mikey did.\"\nWhen Walls does drop back, he'll be looking at a receiving cast that has the potential to be among the Bayside Conference's best.\nLining up at wideout will be a combination of seniors Carter Mooney (6-0, 180) and Kent Island transfer Isaiah Diaz (6-4, 185), and freshmen Nicky O'Connor (6-1, 185) and Tatum Brooks (6-1, 180). There's also plenty of talent at slot, with seniors Zach Barnhart (5-8, 195), Kyree Acree (6-0, 175), sophomore Chad Stanley (6-0, 175) and Horsey.\n\"Isaiah, Nicky, Tatum and Chad are new to the system,\" Griffith said. \"They're learning it. I think they are going to continue to get better as the year goes on. The more time we have for Brady to throw the ball and go through his progressions, the better off we'll be.\"\nProviding that time for Walls and the holes for the backs is a seasoned group, led by three seniors — left tackle Tymiere Thomas (5-11, 275), center Jack Chapple (6-3, 225) and right guard TJ Truxson (5-11, 305). Junior Xavier Stowers (6-3, 240) returns from last year and starts at right tackle, while sophomore Brady Gilliece (6-4, 275) is at left guard. Junior Darrien Downes (6-2, 270) will be rotated in plenty.\n\"I think we're pretty happy with where we're at so far,\" Griffith said of his line. \"We still have a lot of work to do. Great group. So they all return from last year, and Darrien is a nice addition to that starting core.\"\nThe defense also looks solid, returning nine of 11 starters from last year — it would have been 10 of 11 had senior Dionte Copper not suffered a season-ending injury over the summer.\nThomas and Stowers are at tackle, while senior Jeremiah Stanley (6-2, 185) and junior Messiah Joseph (5-9, 185) rotate at nose guard. Senior Tracey Groce (5-11, 285), juniors Elias Leonard (6-0, 315) and Braiden Fluharty (6-3, 225) provide depth up front along with Downes and Gilliece.\n\"Second year in the system with last year being the first in a new system under Al (Waters),\" Griffith said of his defensive coordinator. \"I think we're able to play a little faster. It's less teaching and learning, and more scheme and technique.\"\nLinebacking could be a strength, with Jamiere Copper and Horsey starting inside, and senior Tayshaun Roberts (5-9, 215) and Blue setting up outside. Senior Alex Rhodes (5-10, 205) will get time inside, and juniors Teddy Antal (6-1, 185) and Nevin Whitaker (5-10, 215) figure to get snaps outside.\nThe secondary has senior Logan Friend (5-9, 165) and Brooks at the corners, though Diaz will also play there. Chad Stanley and Acree are at free safety, with Barnhart, Mooney and junior Jerrell Flanagan (5-10, 170) roaming at strong safety.\n\"I expect our defense is what kind of carries us early while our offense is still starting to click a little,\" Griffith said.\nSeniors Kai Ferrias and Luke Stanco share the place-kicking duties, while Griffith can use either Axel Spalin or Horsey to punt.\n\"The Bayside's a tough conference to play in, and we're going to be challenged every week,\" Griffith said. \"If our kids continue to do what we're asking them to do, and expecting them to do, we'll be able to compete with pretty much anybody that we play.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nothing more difficult than taking lead on change\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Well before and since his swearing in on Jan. 20, President Trump has been moving aggressively to secure Senate approval of a team of cabinet and sub-cabinet members to implement his Make America Great Again agenda.To date he has achieved significant, but not yet universal, success on those approvals.\nAs I write this there are at least three of his nominations where final Senate approval is increasingly likely but not certain.\nThey are are Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, Kash Patel for FBI director, and Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence director.\nEarlier last month Trump's nomination of Pete Hegseth to serve as secretary of Defense was approved in the Senate by the narrowest of margins.\nFollowing contentious committee hearings on his background and competence, Hegseth was confirmed only after Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie vote with a \"yes\" vote for him.\nIf any of the pending Trump nominations fail to receive full Senate approval it will be the first time since 1925 when a Republican controlled Senate rejected a Republican president's cabinet nomination. The president then was Calvin Coolidge and the failed nominee was Charles Warren for attorney general.\nTrump's immediate Democratic predecessors — Barack Obama and Joe Biden had all their cabinet nominations approved by the Senate. In both cases there were Democratic majorities in the Senate and some of their more controversial nominations were withdrawn from consideration before full Senate consideration of their nominations.\nThe reasons for resistance to Trump are not surprising.\nOver 500 years ago political observer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli wrote the following timeless observation on change:\n\"It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\"\nIn 2024 Trump ran and won on a change platform and his commitment to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things in Washington.\nThat is similar to the goal that former President Obama expressed when he first ran for the presidency.\nEarly and often on the campaign trail Obama said, \"Washington is broken. My whole campaign has been premised from the start on the idea that we have to fundamentally change how Washington works.\"\nAfter the election to his first term, Obama said with confidence that he had not miscalculated how difficult it would be to change Washington.\nHe said, \"I didn't overpromise. And I didn't underestimate how tough this was gonna be.\"\nAfter four years in office and his election to a second term Obama acknowledged with a combination of frustration, regret and self-reflection, that he had in fact miscalculated and underestimated how hard making changes was going to be.\nHe said \"I'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in a political slugfest … I haven't fully accomplished that. Haven't even come close in some instances. And, you know, if you ask me what's my biggest disappointment [it] is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\"\nTime will tell if Donald Trump acknowledges and says much the same thing after the end of his second term.\nThe first test of success or failure for Trump will occur in less than two years.\nIn November 2026, all the seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the seats in the Senate will be up for election.\nHistorically, but not always, these elections are largely a referendum on a president's performance and agenda.\nIf the Republicans do lose control of the House or the Senate in 2026, any unapproved elements of Trump's MAGA agenda will likely be stalled, if not stopped completely.\nConversely, if that does not occur, the odds for success for Trump in continuing to advance his MAGA agenda are greatly increased.\nIt also increases the odds for Vice President Vance securing the Republican nomination for and winning the election as president in 2028.\nGoing forward, only one thing is certain.\nEither way, we will soon be better able to affirm or challenge the thinking that in the political world, pursuing real change is often an exercise in futility, no matter who is elected president. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lions hope speed equals success\n\n August 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 761\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Brian Mooney brimmed with optimism his first two years as Queen Anne's County High's head football coach.As he enters this season, Mooney admits, \"This is the happiest I've been in my three years (as head coach).\"\nPerhaps the biggest reason for Mooney's sunny outlook is the Lions' collective team speed. Of course, anyone seeking a second opinion on that topic can ask Donny Graef, who was Queen Anne's head coach for 25 years and is now in his second year back as an assistant.\n\"It's not the fastest,\" Graef said. \"But it's definitely one of the fastest teams.\"\nPacing the fast cast is 5-foot-9, 165-pound junior Jadereon Thompson, who starts at wide reciever and safety, returns punts and kickoffs, and can go from zero to the end zone practically every time he touches the ball. He has plenty of fast company that includes senior running back DeRodney Smith (6-0, 170), along with senior Carter Dickey (5-8, 150) and sophomore Zavione Sudler (5-7, 145), who can spell Smith when needed.\n\"Jadereon's a burner,\" Mooney said. \"So is DeRodney. Zay can go, and Carter Dickey's really fast.\"\nThe group behind them aren't exactly slouches in the 40. The McDonald twins, Alex and Alan — both listed at 5-5, 140, are at wide receiver, though Alex could see time at running back. The receiving group also includes senior Brooks Blodgett (6-1, 175) and junior Chance Hegedus (6-2, 185). Senior Dorrin Phillips (5-9, 215) returns at fullback with junior Hunter Kelly (5-10, 195) behind him.\nMooney said he will make a decision over the weekend on his starting quarterback, which has been a battle between senior Lance Arnold (5-11, 185) and sophomore Colton Starlings (6-3, 190).\nIf it can stay healthy, the offensive line could also be a strength. Senior Drew Sutton (5-11, 235) returns at center. Lining up on the right side are a pair of classmates, guard Brian Maleski (5-11, 210) and tackle Gannon Brown (6-4, 215). Senior left guard Levi Frank (6-0, 160) saw time as a starter last season and is flanked by sophomore tackle Austin Mattei (6-3, 215). Senior Jamison Woodward (5-10, 180) starts at tight end.\n\"Hopefully we don't have to have as many combinations as we did last year,\" Mooney said of an offensive line that was plagued with injury from start to finish last season. \"They're growing. Austin is still learning. But if we can just stay healthy it should be a good group.\n\"Every one's bought into what we're doing,\" Mooney continued. \"So everybody has bought into their role. The typical things that you're kind of coaching all the time we're not having to go back and do all the time. This group is locked in. This group is special.\"\nThere is plenty of speed and grit on the defense as well.\nFrank and Phillips start at end with senior Ryan Robinson (5-11, 175) and junior Khalil Lively (6-0, 180) being rotated into the mix. Sutton returns at tackle and is joined up front by junior Brayden Combs (5-11, 220), with Brown and Mattei in the rotation.\nMaleski starts at inside linebacker and is paired with Kelly, who was moved up from strong safety. Woodward is behind them.\nThe secondary has the potential to be very good, with Thompson, Smith, Dickey and senior Wyatt Wilhoit (5-9, 180) at the safeties, and Blodgett, Hegedus, Alan McDonald and senior Elijah Billups (5-9, 150) at the corners.\nThe special teams could also be among the Bayside Conference's best with Thompson, Smith, Hegedus and Sudler handling punts and kickoffs. Junior Adrian Altamirano has shown a big leg in practice and could have a big impact.\nMooney was encouraged by what he saw during last Friday's scrimmage against a bigger St. Paul's team. But like a year ago, the Lions are thin and hope to avoid the string of injuries that hampered last season.\n\"Last year we felt really good going into the season and then had a couple of bumps with health,\" Mooney said. \"That's always the key for everybody. But I think the sky's the limit. I don't see any reason why this team can't go deep in the playoffs.\"\nQueen Anne's will be part of the 2A/1A East Region this season along with Southern (Anne Arundel), Calvert, Lackey, Hammond and fellow Bayside Conference rivals Easton and Kent Island.\n\"We're just going to take it one game at a time,\" Mooney said. \"I know that's coach-speak, but that's kind of how we have to be right now because of where we are in terms of numbers. We just got to re-evaluate where we're at every week and keep rolling. It's just an exciting time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No matter. Nothing stopped the world's No. 1 player on his way to a 7-under 64 to build a one-shot lead going into the weekend.Scheffler made eight birdies on another wild afternoon of weather at Royal Portrush, and his 15-foot birdie attempt on the 18th stopped inches short for another.\nThe result was a one-shot lead over former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who made four straight birdies to start the back nine until he cooled on the home stretch and had to settle for a 66.\nThe rain was heavy at times but never lasted long. The wind was breezy but never at strength that can cause fits. The scoring was lower, nearly two shots easier than the opening round.\nExcept for a few chasers, Scheffler made it look like it wasn't enough.\nHe was at 10-under 132 as he chases the third leg of the career Grand Slam, having won the PGA Championship by five shots in May.\nBrian Harman got the best of the weather — surprising sunshine — and took dead aim in his hunt for another claret jug. Harman played bogey-free for a 64 that left him only two shots behind, along with Li Haotong of China, who had a 67.\nEveryone else was five shots behind or more.\nThat includes Rory McIlroy, who went around Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland with plenty of cheers but only a few roars. McIlroy had a 69 but lost a lot of ground because of Scheffler, Fitzpatrick and Harman.\nHe started the second round just three shots behind. He goes into the weekend seven shots behind the top-ranked player in the world.\nFitzpatrick was at his lowest point just four months ago when he changed his caddie and coach and began pulling himself up. And now he takes that into the weekend against Scheffler.\n\"He's going to have the expectation to go out and dominate. He's an exceptional player. He's world No. 1, and we're seeing Tiger-like stuff,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I think the pressure is for him to win the golf tournament. For me, obviously I hope I'm going to have some more home support than him, but it's an exciting position for me to be in given where I was earlier this year.\"\nFitzpatrick was rolling along until a pair of short putts he missed, from 5 feet for par on the 14th and from 3 feet for birdie on the 17th. Even so, he holed a 25-foot par putt on the final hole and assured him being in the last group at 9-under 133.\nScheffler was sharp from the start. He hit eight of the 14 fairways — compared with three in the opening round — though his misses never left him too badly out of position. But he is seeing the breaks on smoother Portrush greens, and he looks confident as ever.\nNone of his eight birdies were closer than 7 feet. Five of them were in the 10-foot range and then he threw in a 35-foot birdie on the sixth. His lone bogey came on a drive into deep grass on the 11th that kept him from reaching the green.\nThe statistics led to a shrug.\n\"Overall, I'm hitting the ball solid,\" Scheffler said. \"The tournament is only halfway done. I got off to a good start.\"\nHarman was called the \"Butcher of Hoylake\" when he won the claret jug at Royal Liverpool two years ago because the British press was fascinated by the Georgia native's love for hunting. Now it's about his golf, and it was superb.\nHarman played bogey-free, only once having to stress for par as Royal Portrush allowed for some good scoring in weather that again did not live up to its expectation.\nNot that anyone was complaining. Temperatures were warm, at least by Irish standards. The breeze was noticeable without being overly punishing.\n\"They're very different golf courses, but the golf is similar,\" Harman said. \"You've got to be able to flight your golf ball. You've got to know how far everything's going. Then you can't get frustrated. You're going to end up in funny spots where it doesn't seem fair, and you just have to kind of outlast that stuff.\"\nThe group at 5-under 137 included Harris English (70), Harman's former teammate at Georgia; Tyrrell Hatton of England (69) and Chris Gotterup (65), who wasn't even planning to be at Royal Portrush until winning the Scottish Open last week.\nAlso still around is Bryson DeChambeau, who made a 13-shot improvement from the first round with a 65. Still, he was 11 shots behind.\nMcIlroy wasn't at his best in the opening round and was pleased to be only three behind. Now he has a real mountain to climb. But at least he's still playing, unlike in 2019 at Royal Portrush when he shot 79 and then had a terrific rally only to miss the cut by one shot.\n\"I didn't have this opportunity six years ago, so to play an extra two days in this atmosphere in front of these crowds, I'm very excited for that,\" McIlroy said. \"I feel like my game's definitely good enough to make a run.\"\nThat was before Scheffler began to run away from so many except a small collection of challengers. But this is links golf. And this is the Emerald Isle, where the weather seems to have a mind of its own.\nStill, Scheffler has gone 10 tournaments without finishing out of the top 10 and would appear to present a challenge every bit as daunting as Royal Portrush. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A yacht to do: Bay Bridge Boat Show comes to Kent Narrows\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 601\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n KENT NARROWS — Setting sail into the boating season with a new charter, the Bay Bridge Boat Show is coming to the Kent Narrows area at Safe Harbor Narrows Point April 11 through April 13.After 26 years at the Bay Bridge Marina, the new venue at Safe Harbor Narrows Point promises to retain the spirit attendees love while strengthening community fellowship alongside even more amenities and better parking.\n\"We are extremely excited that we were able to keep the Bay Bridge Boat Show in Queen Anne's County and think the new location at Safe Harbor Marina Kent Narrows will only enhance the economic impact to the region,\" Heather Tinelli, director of Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development said. \"It is our hope that patrons of the boat show will stay overnight, enjoy all of our wonderful dining options, shop locally and of course buy a boat.\"\nWhether boat enthusiasts looking to buy a new vessel or those looking for a day on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay, the powerboat show is complete with services, products, exhibitions and shipshape retail therapy.\nCommunity and conservation are a focus of this year's spring power boat show, according to Annapolis Boat Shows' President, Mary Ewenson.\nCommitted to sustainability and conservation and environmental impacts, the boat show is proud to welcome numerous non-profits, and environmental organizations highlighting resources with free seminars, including the Department of Natural Resources, Coastal Conservation Association of Maryland, and the Department of Agriculture.\n\"Getting people excited about boats is a good way to get excited about the Chesapeake Bay. If you don't get out on the Bay you don't know it needs protecting, Ewenson said.\nShe is excited that by partnering with local businesses and building connections with the community, the show really connects with the community and emphasizes local involvement.\nWelcoming attendees by land and water, both local and away, the boat show offers a unique opportunity to showcase the culture of the surrounding Kent Narrows, including additional shopping, restaurants, hotels, businesses, and the Cross Island Trail.\n\"It will really benefit the whole area. This is not a convention center, this is people's lives and businesses,\" Ewenson said of this year's show venue.\nIn addition to showcasing the local area, the boat show also seeks to provide accessibility to anyone with maritime interests, with onsite hands-on training available to make any land lubber sea worthy of a new vessel.\nWith new powerboats on the market to behold, an expanded demo dock will offer attendees the opportunity to climb aboard a wide array of powerboats of every style and size. From fishing boats and trawlers to pontoon boats and luxury cruisers, last year's powerboat show saw more than 250 boats, and at least as many are expected this season, she said.\n\"If you're a seasoned boater or a first timer, the show will offer something new for everyone to explore,\" said Annapolis Boat Shows' General Manager Sheila Jones.\nMarine industry career networking opportunities will also be available alongside information about nearby boating clubs and schools.\nAnd a great aspect of spring shows is that you can take your new boat out on the water right away, she said.\n\"Whether you're here for the boats, the education, or the food and entertainment, it's always a ton of fun. And the beautiful new venue means visitors may board even more exciting new powerboats and shop everything from gear and accessories to electronics, communication equipment, education, clubs, and more.\"\nShuttles will run between the lot at the old outlets off Exit 41 and the show.\nAn event certainly not to 'skiff', you can 'ketch' more information about the Bay Bridge Boat Show and other local shows at BayBridgeBoatShow.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Man charged with murder in fatal shooting\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Investigators have filed murder charges against a man who allegedly shot a visitor at close range outside his residence near Elkton earlier this week during an incident that was caught on security camera video, according to Cecil County District Court records.The suspect — Donald Raymond Snyder Jr., 41 — reportedly surrendered himself to the Maryland State Police late Thursday night at the agency's North East Barrack, in accordance with arrangements that had been made amid the investigation.\nSnyder is accused of gunning down Christopher Cimorose, 55, of Elkton, at approximately 9:20 p.m. on Monday in the driveway of Snyder's residence in the unit block of Locust Point Road, south of Elkton.\nMSP troopers and other first responders rushed to that Locust Point Road residence at 9:24 p.m. Monday, after Snyder called and told a 911 dispatcher, \"Someone just got shot,\" at that address, police reported.\n\"As the dispatcher was collecting the information on the call for service, she asked Snyder directly if he shot the gun. Snyder replied, 'Yeah',\" according to the charging document.\nAt the scene, troopers spoke to Snyder and his 46-year-old girlfriend, Michelle McCarthy, before driving them to the North East Barrack, where MSP Homicide Unit investigators interviewed them, police said. Investigators secured Snyder's weapon, which had been placed in the bed of a pickup truck on the premises before first responders arrived, police added.\nParamedics pronounced Cimorose dead at the scene, police reported.\nDuring the on-scene investigation, MSP detectives confiscated external security cameras on Snyder's property, after obtaining a warrant to do so, court records show.\nInvestigators note in court documents that \"a few of the cameras\" faced the driveway \"where the intentional killing of Cimorose took place,\" and that they produced a video showing the fatal shooting and the events leading up to it.\nInvestigators had sent the confiscated DVR security system to MSP's Digital Forensic Lab on Wednesday, and technicians there extricated a 19-minute-long, motion-activated video clip of what occurred outside Snyder's residence on Monday night, court records show.\nThe video first shows Snyder and McCarthy exit the Locust Point Road residence and then get into McCarthy's vehicle in the driveway at approximately 9 p.m. Monday, with McCarthy sliding into the driver's seat and Snyder getting into the seat directly behind her, police reported.\nAbout two minutes later, the video shows Cimorose pulling into that driveway in a red Nissan Versa, according to court records, which indicate that Cimorose was there to pick up McCarthy. The document does not provide a reason why Cimorose was there to pick up McCarthy.\nThe video then shows McCarthy exit her vehicle and walk to the front passenger's seat of Cimorose's Nissan and Snyder walk directly to the open window of the Nissan's driver's side door, police reported.\n\"Snyder almost immediately punches Cimorose in the head/face area, as he was still in the vehicle. As a response to being punched, Cimorose's vehicle lunged forward, dragging Snyder for a few feet,\" according to the charging document.\nBefore the Nissan came to a stop, Snyder armed himself, based on the footage, police reported.\n\"Snynder removes 9mm handgun from his waistband and points it at Cimorose. Cimorose places his vehicle in park, opens his door (and) attempts to get out of his vehicle — at which time Snyder fired three (3) times, striking Cimorose in the neck and chest area. Cimorose is observed falling to the ground next to his vehicle. Lying next to him was wooden table leg,\" court records allege.\nDuring his police interview at the MSP barrack later that night, Snyder maintained that Cimorose was the aggressor, court records show.\n\"Snyder stated 'As far as I can see, the man grabbed a pipe and came at me.' Snyder also stated, 'I never wanted to do this',\" according to the charging document.\nMSP investigators consulted with the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office before filing criminal charges against Snyder on Thursday, court records indicate.\nSnyder is charged with second-degree murder, a felony that is punishable by up to 40 years in prison if convicted, and five other offenses, including first-degree assault, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence and reckless endangerment, court records show.\nHe remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Friday, after his bail review hearing earlier that day, according to court records, which show that Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider presided over that proceeding. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Inventive recipes from the 1940s\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1294\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Yes, it is that time of year again. And I do not mean Super Bowl, or Valentine's Day or tax time. It is a time that I let slip by quietly.I was born on Feb. 11, 194... My mother told me it was 3 degrees that February morning. I was born at home, so that meant the doctor traveled across town on snow- and ice-covered roads. My sister was 10 years old and at that time. I already had six older brothers, soon to be followed by three more brothers.\nMy sister's birthday was Feb. 15, and she did not want to share birthday parties. Some world and national news in the 1940s included the Italian partisans killed Mussolini, Hitler committing suicide after destroying major cities in Germany, World War II ending, Harry Truman taking the office of President after Roosevelt passed away.\nNot only were things hard on our Bishopville farm, but the whole world was feeling the impact of World War 2. Creativity blossomed during the Great Depression and carried on into the 1940s.\nThe decade of the 1940s brought many things to our world: The microwave oven, ball point pens, Velcro, Tupperware and the frozen orange juice.\nHistory has shown us again and again that financial hardship drives people to get a little more inventive in the kitchen.\nWartime rations necessitated substitutes and ingredient-stretching techniques. As a matter of fact, on the back of my birth certificate are stamps for sugar and flour. Thankfully, my parents never needed to use them.\nAfter the war ended, food manufacturers explored methods that gave products a longer shelf life. During the latter half of the decade, more convenience products arrived on shelves as scientists delved into researching food preservation.\nLike most 1940s recipes, meatloaf experienced a resurgence in popularity during the Great Depression. The use of bread or cracker crumbs helped stretch the ground beef as it was getting harder and harder to come by.\nWhen the soldiers came back home from the Pacific they also brought home a love of SPAM. Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and Okinawa were places Spam was the most popular. Most of the time eggs were mixed with Spam because they were cheap and most everyone had chickens in the backyard.\n\"Victory Gardens\" were another big thing in the 1940s. Many papers circulated various vegetable recipes. Soups and stews were cost-effective meals that could also stretch more precious ingredients such as meat and dairy.\nNo bake cookies that used things such as Corn flakes were served in just about all houses, even the White House.\nOne invention that has surely at one time or another been in just about everyone's hands — the corn dog — was created by German immigrants in Texas, who were sausage-makers finding resistance to the sausages they used to make. They have been credited with introducing the corn dog to the United States in the early 1920s, though the serving stick came later.\nCarl and Neil Fletcher can claim that having introduced their \"Corny Dogs\" at the State Fair of Texas sometime in 1942. In 1946, on Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California, Dave Barham opened the first Hot Dog on a Stick location.\nSo, as you see, the corn dog has a long disputed history, but boy are we glad to have it.\nHere are some recipes from the 1940s this week to not only celebrate my birthday but to revisit a time where counting every penny and getting creative was a must.\nHOMEMADE CORN DOGS1 cup yellow cornmeal, 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ cup white sugar, 4 tsps baking powder, ¼ tsp salt, ⅛ tsp black pepper, 1 cup milk, 1 egg, 1 quart vegetable oil for frying, 2 (16-oz) packages beef frankfurters, a pack of wooden skewers.\nCombine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one, roll frankfurters in batter until well coated. Fry two or three corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\n1940s BROWN SUGAR MEATLOAFCooking spray, ½ cup packed brown sugar, ½ cup ketchup, 1 ½ lbs lean ground beef, 2 large eggs, 1 small onion (chopped), ¾ cup milk, ¾ cup finely crushed saltine cracker crumbs, 1 ½ tsps salt, ¼ tsp ground black pepper, ¼ tsp ground ginger.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 5-by-9-inch loaf pan. Press brown sugar into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan and spread ketchup over sugar. Mix all remaining ingredients thoroughly in a mixing bowl and shape into a loaf. Place on top of the ketchup and sugar crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until juices are clear.\nSPAM AND EGGS2 large eggs (beaten), 1 container fully cooked luncheon meat, 2 oz Cheddar cheese (grated).\nCube the meat. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into the skillet, then scatter luncheon meat over top. Cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over top and stir until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.\nGARDEN FRESH TOMATO SOUP4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes, 2 cups chicken broth, 4 cloves garlic, 1 large slice of onion, 2 tbsps butter, 2 tbsps all-purpose flour, 2 tsps white sugar to taste, 1 tsp salt to taste.\nCombine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl or pan, Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture turns medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt to taste.\nNO BAKE COOKIES½ cup white sugar, ½ cup light corn syrup, 2 tbsps butter, ½ cup peanut butter, 3 cups of corn flakes cereal.\nBring sugar and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in butter and peanut butter until thoroughly combined, then remove from the heat. Place cornflakes into a large bowl. Pour peanut butter mixture over top and mix until cornflakes are well coated. Drop 1-tablespoon scoops of the mixture onto a waxed-paper lined baking sheet. Flatten slightly if desired, then allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\n1 cup cold water,½ cup uncooked long grain white rice,1 tablespoon vegetable oil,1 pound ground beef,6 medium green bell peppers,16 ounces tomato sauce, divided,1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce,¼ teaspoon garlic powder,¼ teaspoon onion powder, salt and ground black pepper to taste,1 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes. Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward. Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper. Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers. Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Are you having suicidal thoughts?\" Be direct and compassionate.Research shows that asking this question will not put the idea into someone's mind.Share: \"You are not alone. Help is available.\" Connect them to services.For All Seasons is just a phone call away.Listen: You don't need to have all the answers. Be fully present without judgment.

    "content": "‘A gem’: State and local leaders celebrate Port Street Commons project\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 596\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A multi-use property bringing affordable housing and behavioral health services to Easton is officially complete.Port Street Commons, a 24,000-square-foot project led by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, celebrated the end of construction with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that included local and state officials. The space houses nine apartment units as well as a headquarters for The Arc, complete with offices and a behavioral health suite.\nSpeaking to more than 100 attendees Thursday morning, The Arc President and CEO Jonathon Rondeau said the organization is \"building a future where equity and inclusion are the norm.\"\n\"There will be people whose lives change within these walls because of the services they receive, the connections they make, the housing they can afford,\" Rondeau said.\nThe $11 million project, financed through a capital campaign, received $2.5 million in investment from the state and $750,000 in federal funding, Rondeau said. Chesapeake Neighbors, a housing subsidiary of The Arc, held a lottery in September for potential tenants that fell within the income requirements, with more than 250 people entering.\nThere are seven two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units, all of them featuring free Wi-Fi and appliances. Two of the first-floor units are tailored to accommodate tenants with disabilities.\nMembers of the Easton Town Council and Talbot County Council, along with Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), attended Thursday's ceremony.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said the project is a fit for the town's goal to revitalize the area next to the Tred Avon River. She noted Port Street Commons is the first project to fall under the town's mixed-use waterfront zoning.\n\"We're eager to encourage mixed-use facilities such as this, allowing for exciting new businesses in tandem with more affordable housing, both of which are critical for growth in our community,\" she said.\nThe site at 480 Port Street was identified in July 2021, and construction began just under two years later. In an interview, Rondeau said the quick timeline helps The Arc fulfill the community's immediate housing needs, adding that the town was a crucial partner.\n\"There's a lot of development happening here in Easton,\" Rondeau said. \"It's a small town, only so many inspectors and things like that. The town has been great. They've really worked with us to help meet those timelines when we had a problem.\"\nRondeau said four families who were randomly drawn have been confirmed, with the first of those moving in Dec. 2. All nine apartments should be occupied by March, he said.\nJulia Glanz, deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Housing & Community Development, and Carol Beatty, secretary of the Maryland Department of Disabilities, both complimented the housing project during the ceremony.\nBeatty said the apartments tackle \"one of the most common concerns\" she hears from Marylanders with disabilities — a lack of accessible housing that is also affordable.\nGlanz was excited about the project and hopes it can be an example for other mixed-use housing endeavors.\n\"It is, I think, a gem across the state,\" Glanz said in an interview. \" … From what I've seen in the last year and a half, this is very unique. And it's bringing so many different facets of life into one space.\"\nThe deputy secretary noted that the House Expansion and Affordability Act of 2024, which encourages higher-density affordable housing projects, reduces government barriers. However, Port Street Commons completed most of its three-and-a-half year turnaround before that act was passed.\n\"The Arc being able to do that without that legislation … is a testament to the community effort here in Easton and Talbot County, which we don't see everywhere,\" Glanz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How long was he on \"The X-Files\"?A: The actor's run as FBI Agent Fox Mulder began in 1993, and he has said that he didn't expect the Fox series (now repeating on Comet) to last as long as it did, nor to be as popular as it became. His regular weekly run on the show went through the seventh season, when headlines were made by a lawsuit Duchovny filed against 20th Century Fox Television, alleging that it sold rights to repeats of the show to Fox-affiliated stations for less than they were worth thus costing him some profits.The suit was settled, but Duchovny's contract for the show was up, so he left as a full-time cast member (with Robert Patrick assuming the role of a Mulder surrogate, John Doggett). However, Duchovny returned for part of the eighth season, with the explanation that Mulder had been abducted by aliens.He also came back for the presumed series finale in Season 9, but as it turned out, he wasn't done with the show yet.Fox gave \"The X-Files\" revivals as a limited-run program in 2016 and 2018, which were deemed to be the 10th and 11th seasons of the show. Series creator-producer Chris Carter has inferred that there are more stories in that universe to be told, but any discussions of a continuation of the franchise haven't come to fruition. The show also yielded two theatrical films in which Duchovny played Mulder (opposite Gillian Anderson's Agent Dana Scully), \"The X-Files: Fight the Future\" (1998) and \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" (2008). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Corporate tax breaks end up costing schools\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE CONVERSATION | Section: National \n \n 1063\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Built in 1910, James Elementary is a three-story brick school in Kansas City, Missouri's historic Northeast neighborhood, with a bright blue front door framed by a sand-colored stone arch adorned with a gargoyle.As bustling students and teachers negotiate a maze of gray stairs with worn wooden handrails, Marjorie Mayes, the school's principal, escorts a visitor across uneven blue tile floors on the ground floor to a classroom with exposed brick walls and pipes. Bubbling paint mars some walls, evidence of the water leaks spreading inside the aging building.\n\"It's living history,\" said Mayes during a mid-September tour of the building. \"Not the kind of living history we want.\"\nThe district would like to tackle the $400 million in deferred maintenance needed to create a 21st century learning environment at its 35 schools — including James Elementary — but it can't. It doesn't have the money.\nPROPERTY TAX REDIRECT\nThe lack of funds is a direct result of the property tax breaks that Kansas City lavishes on companies and developers that do business there. The program is supposed to bring in new jobs and business but instead has ended up draining civic coffers and starving schools. Between 2017 and 2023, the Kansas City school district lost $237.3 million through tax abatements.\nKansas City is hardly an anomaly. An estimated 95% of U.S. cities provide economic development tax incentives to woo corporate investors. The upshot is that billions have been diverted from large urban school districts and from a growing number of small suburban and rural districts. The impact is seen in districts as diverse as Chicago and Cleveland, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Storey County, Nevada.\nThe result? A 2021 review of 2,498 financial statements from school districts across 27 states revealed that, in 2019 alone, at least $2.4 billion was diverted to fund tax incentives. Yet that substantial figure still downplays the magnitude of the problem, because three-quarters of the 10,370 districts analyzed did not provide any information on tax abatement agreements.\nTax abatement programs have long been controversial, pitting states and communities against one another in beggar-thy-neighbor contests. Their economic value is also, at best, unclear: Studies show most companies would have made the same location decision without taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, schools make up the largest cost item in these communities, meaning they suffer most when companies are granted breaks in property taxes.\nA three-month investigation by The Conversation and three scholars with expertise in economic development, tax laws and education policy shows that the cash drain from these programs is not equally shared by schools in the same communities. At the local level, tax abatements and exemptions often come at the cost of critical funding for school districts that students from low-income households and who are racial minorities.\nIn Missouri, for example, in 2022 nearly $1,700 per student was redirected from Kansas City public and charter schools, while between $500 and $900 was redirected from wealthier, whiter Northland schools on the north side of the river in Kansas City and in the suburbs beyond. Other studies have found similar demographic trends elsewhere, including New York state, South Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nThe funding gaps produced by abated money often force schools to delay needed maintenance, increase class sizes, lay off teachers and support staff and even close outright. Schools also struggle to update or replace outdated technology, books and other educational resources. And, amid a nationwide teacher shortage, schools under financial pressures sometimes turn to inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or rely too heavily on recruits from overseas who have been given special visa status.\nLost funding also prevents teachers and staff, who often feed, clothe and otherwise go above and beyond to help students in need, from earning a living wage. All told, tax abatements can end up harming a community's value, with constant funding shortfalls creating a cycle of decline.\nINCENTIVES AND PAYOFFS\nPerversely, some of the largest beneficiaries of tax abatements are the politicians who publicly boast of handing out the breaks despite the harm to poorer communities. Incumbent governors have used the incentives as a means of taking credit for job creation, even when the jobs were coming anyway.\n\"We know that subsidies don't work,\" said Elizabeth Marcello, a doctoral lecturer at Hunter College who studies governmental planning and policy and the interactions between state and local governments. \"But they are good political stories, and I think that's why politicians love them so much.\"\nWhile some voters may celebrate abatements, parents can recognize the disparities between school districts that are created by the tax breaks. Fairleigh Jackson pointed out that her daughter's East Baton Rouge third grade class lacks access to playground equipment.\nThe class is attending school in a temporary building while their elementary school undergoes a two-year renovation.\nThe temporary site has some grass and a cement slab where kids can play, but no playground equipment, Jackson said. And parents needed to set up an Amazon wish list to purchase basic equipment such as balls, jump ropes and chalk for students to use. The district told parents there would be no playground equipment due to a lack of funds, then promised to install equipment, Jackson said, but months later, there is none.\nJackson said it's hard to complain when other schools in the district don't even have needed security measures in place. \"When I think about playground equipment, I think that's a necessary piece of child development,\" Jackson said. \"Do we even advocate for something that should be a daily part of our kids' experience when kids' safety isn't being funded?\"\nA young student in the East Baton Rouge district told the school board that money going to tax breaks for corporations could provide better internet access or be used to hire someone to pick up the glass and barbed wire in the playground. But at least they have a playground — Hayden Crockett, a seventh grader at Sherwood Middle Academic Magnet School, noted that his sister's elementary school lacked one.\n\"If it wasn't in the budget to fund playground equipment, how can it also be in the budget to give one of the most powerful corporations in the world a tax break?\" Crockett said. \"The math just ain't mathing.\"\nThis article was written by Christine Wen, Texas A&M University; Danielle McLean, The Conversation; Kevin Welner, University of Colorado Boulder; and Nathan Jensen, The University of Texas at Austin.

And they truly love what they're doing,\" he said.\nAlways on the lookout for agriculture stories, after his team met Jenell, Ferrier knew there was a great story to tell.\n\"The McHenrys personify the current crop of young farmers,\" Ferrier remarked. \"They're great people.\"\nMPT spent about three hours shooting at the McHenry property, a farm that has been in Kennedyville since 1965, with Associate Producer Luke Fisher writing the script. In a fast turnaround, the episode was created in roughly three weeks.\nFurther into the episode, Clendining informed the audience that farming is one of the most dangerous professions.\nThe McHenrys can certainly attest.\nIn his own words, Joe talked about how sudden his accident happened.\nNov. 5, 2022, at 6:30 a.m., Joe said they just had two weeks of terrible harvesting conditions. He was stressed, driving his tractor on US state 298, and had just glanced away to look at the dew on the soybeans.\nIn that flash of a moment things changed.\nHis wheels hit fresh gravel, and the rear end of the tractor kicked out, flipping into the ditch.\n\"I wasn't sure if I yanked the wheel, but that was the last thing I remembered until I woke up,\" Joe recounts.\nHe sustained a broken pelvis, dislodged spine, a puncture wound and internal bleeding.\n\"I was in a bad place,\" Joe acknowledged. Jenell can clearly remember the disconcerting events.\nAs emergency services rushed to the scene, she got a text from Joe's sister, asking if Joe was helping assist with the accident.\nJenell tried to contact her husband, and when she didn't receive a response, she felt something awful just happened.\nHer fears were realized, when she arrived by the roadside to see the flipped tractor and her husband being loaded in the ambulance.\nJoe came to before he blacked out again, with the familiar voice of a first responder, a friend's, fading. He awoke again at Christiana Care emergency room before being placed in a medicated coma to allow for healing.\nJenell prayed.\n\"I asked the good Lord to keep him breathing with no brain injuries, and that's what I got,\" she said.\nWith his friends and family praying, Joe underwent an experimental surgery where rods and plates were placed to help him walk again.\nAs MPT's narrator put it, \"He would spend the next 37 days in the hospital before moving to rehab.\"\nJoe did recover, with friends, his employees, and the community at his side.\nFrom strong adversity, the McHenry's keep going. Something that amazes Ferrier, even after his years of working for companies like Discovery, visiting exotic locales.\nMore than 16 million viewers have watched \"Maryland Farm and Harvest\" since its debut in 2013, Ferrier said.\n\"We celebrate agriculture in all its forms. Whatever you raise, grow or pick, we love telling the stories.\"\nView episodes on MPT Tuesdays at 7 p.m., or past episodes at video.mpt.tv/show/maryland-farm-harvest/.

This has been a lot of work on the staff, we really didn't have a lot of hard lift this year. We just set some priorities and staff made it happen, so it's spectacular.\"\nThe tax rate decreases from 69 cents per $100 of assessed value to 66 cents per $100 of assessed value on properties taxed within the boundaries of Denton. Town officials credit increased property values in Denton for being able to lower the rate.\n\"Because our property rates were higher, if we had stayed the same, people would have had the same tax rate but they would have been paying more money because of the percentage,\" McNinch said. \"That's when when we decide to go down, the impact is, $40,000 roughly on our budget.\"\nAccording to McNinch, the officials understand that some fees might increase, but they felt lowering the tax rate was the best decision for the town residents and for the council.\n\"We're aware that other taxes and fees might increase, but we need to hold our line ... we want to make sure we're providing the best services to our public and other things that might go up are county, state, utilities, that we don't have control over,\" McNinch said. \"But with us trying to reduce and trying to put these things in place. We understand it's tough out there right now. It is for us too.\"\nDenton tax revenues will increase by close to $150,000, while license and agencies revenues will decrease next fiscal year, according to the approved budget.\nWhile a majority of the expenditures saw minor increases and decreases, Park and Recreation received the biggest decrease, dropping by $60,000.\n\"We've gotten things done,\" McNinch said. \"We've gotten the Fourth Street Park done, we're partnering with the county, and the Sharp Road Park looks different. We've had park plans in place and and we've been able to get things done. So yes, that impacts the budget positively.\"\nTourism Visitor Center received a $14,000 increase, and Main Street received about a $4,000 increase in the budget. According to Mayor McNinch, Denton being named the first American Discovery Trail Town has an \"impact on the decision.\"\n\"We want our visitor center open as much as possible,\" McNinch said. \"We've been able to help support that a little bit more over the course of the last couple of years. We see the benefit of tourism for economic development.\n\"Things like the American Heritage Trail, we do see an increase in visitation to our visitor center. Those things are important, and we also increased the Main Street budget a little bit, because again that all works in trying to provide a community that people want to visit and want to live.\"\nFor more information on Denton Town Council fiscal year 2026 budget, go to dentonmaryland.com/departments/finance/tax-rates. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The county's recent initiative to recycle single-use boat shrink wrap has resulted in a significant increase in the amount of plastic diverted from landfills.In the second year of the program, the Queen Anne's County government, in partnership with Plastic Free QAC and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, has seen a 370% increase in the amount of recycled shrink wrap compared to last year.\nThis year, a total of six tons pounds of plastic shrink wrap was collected and recycled, a substantial increase from the 1.62 tons collected in 2023.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil expressed his enthusiasm, stating, \"This significant increase in our recycling efforts underscores the dedication and commitment of our residents and businesses to protect our county. By expanding the availability of MTAM recycle bags and increasing the public awareness, we have made it easier for everyone to participate in this important initiative.\"\nKey highlights of this year's success include:\nIncreased participation from individual boat owner with a notable rise in the number of individual boat owners participating in the recycling program, showcasing the community's growing environmental consciousness.Expansion of recycling bag pickup locations; the program expanded from one to four convenient pickup locations for MTAM recycle bags, including:West Marine in Chester, Rommel's Ace Hardware in Stevensville, Centreville Town Hall and Refill Goodness in Stevensville.Commitment from local marinas and boat companies. Several local businesses committed to responsible disposal of shrink wrap, among them: Bay Bridge Marina, Bosun's Marine, Atlantic Yacht Services and Pocket Yacht Company\nThe MTAM recycle bags, sponsored by the County Commissioners, were provided free of charge and made available at multiple locations. The dedicated MTAM shrink wrap dumpster at the Grasonville Transfer Station facilitated easy and eco-friendly disposal for boat owners from early April to June.\nThis initiative is part of Queen Anne's County's broader commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability. By continuing to work together, the county aims to set an example for other communities across Maryland and beyond.\nPlastic Free QAC started in 2018 with the mission to reduce single-use plastic usage in general and places focus on education and building public awareness, according to Sara Shelley, president of Plastic Free QAC.\n\"We are really thrilled with the community response,\" she said.\nUnderstanding that old habits with single-use plastics can be hard to shake, Plastic Free QAC looks to continually build involvement by connecting with individual boat owners and hosting community-wide clean ups, Shelley said.\nFor more information about the recycling program, including where to pick up MTAM recycle bags and drop off cleaned shrink wrap, visit https://lnk.bio/RecycleBoatShrinkwrap. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, about 99 percent of Medicare beneficiaries do not have a Part A premium since they have at least 40 quarters of Medicare-covered employment, as determined by the Social Security Administration.Medicare Part B covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment, and other medical and health services not covered by Medicare Part A. The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will be $174.70 for 2024, an increase of $9.80 from $164.90 in 2023. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will be $240 in 2024, an increase of $14 from the annual deductible of $226 in 2023.A beneficiary's Part D monthly premium adjustment is based on his or her income and affects roughly 8 percent of people with Medicare Part D. These individuals will pay the income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to their Part D premium.NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTHCelebrated every November, National Family Caregivers Month is a time to recognize and honor family caregivers, including spouses, adult children, relatives, and friends, who provide invaluable support to older adults and people with disabilities.More than 53 million family caregivers provide unpaid care across the country.AARP estimates that in 2021, family caregivers provided 36 billion hours of care valued at $600 billion, up from 34 billion hours of care valued at $470 billion just two years before. At the same time, at least 2.7 million grandparents-and an unknown number of other relative caregivers-carry the primary responsibility for caring for grandchildren whose parents are unable to do so.\"We recognize the need for a robust, coordinated approach to supporting family and kinship caregivers,\" said Maryland Department of Aging Secretary Carmel Roques. \"As the youngest Baby Boomers turn 65 in 2029 and lifespans continue to climb into the 80s and beyond, the demand for at-home care is going to soar.\"MARYLAND FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAMIn an effort to help family and informal caregivers care for loved ones at home for as long as possible, the Maryland Department of Aging administers the Family Caregiver Support Program (FCSP) through the Area Agency on Aging (AAA) network. AAAs provide FCSP services including counseling, case management, training, support group resources, information and referral, and respite care. To learn more about the program, funded by the Administration for Community Living, or find events taking place in your county celebrating family caregivers, go to aging.maryland.gov.

For example, I have seen many road signs claiming \"Slow Children Playing.\" Presumably the quick children are at home studying. Also open to misinterpretation was this sign in Northern Ireland: \"If you find the service in this cafe unsatisfactory, you should see Mr. Wilson the manager.\" The correct play in today's deal should be crystal clear to an expert.After a straightforward auction to four hearts, West leads the club king. How should South plan the play?Declarer has nine top tricks: six hearts, two diamonds and one club. If East has the spade ace, everything will be smooth sailing, but is that likely? West made a two-level vulnerable overcall.Surely he has the spade ace.The next thought is to play three rounds of diamonds, hoping both that they break 3-3 and that West has to win the third round. That is a faint hope against defenders with any acumen.The only way to benefit from a 3-3 diamond break is not to lose a diamond trick. South achieved this by calmly playing low from the dummy at trick one.South won the second trick with dummy's club ace, discarding a low diamond from his hand. He then cashed two top trumps in hand. Declarer continued with the diamond ace, a diamond to the king and a diamond ruff. When they split 3-3, South played a heart to dummy's jack and discarded a spade loser on the 13th diamond.After congratulating South on his play, West commented, \"Sorry, partner. Next time I'll lead fourth-highest from my longest and strongest.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best way to honor legacy of Anne Frank is simple\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 725\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent chain of events led me to think about another chain of events during World War II for a young girl who once aspired to be a famous writer.She ultimately achieved that goal, but not in a way that she had ever dreamed about or ever aspired to do.\nHer name is Anne Frank.\nAnne died at age 15 along with most of her family in a Nazi concentration camp.\nBefore she and her family were sent to the concentration camp, they spent two years hiding from the Nazis in a secret sealed apartment in Amsterdam. During that time, Anne kept a written diary now known as \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\"\nHer diary was published posthumously in 1947. Translated into almost 70 languages, it is one of the most widely read accounts of the Holocaust.\nI had largely forgotten about Anne Frank and her diary until a series of unexpected events unfolded during a recent weekend.\nOn a Saturday afternoon, my wife and I drove to St. Michaels to enjoy a beautiful early spring day. It was a by all measures a perfect day.\nThe next morning was far from perfect.\nIt started when my wife launched a frantic search for her wallet. Like most wallets it contained her driver's license, credit cards and health insurance cards. It also included a substantial amount of cash for a Monday bank deposit to be used to pay for long-planned and much needed home improvement project.\nAfter retracing all her Saturday steps, we concluded her wallet likely fell out of her back pocket while we were sitting on a park bench in St. Michaels.\nI called the St. Michaels police to ask if anyone had turned in a lost wallet. The answer was no, not yet. The officer volunteered to go to the park and search for it. When he called back, he told us there was no trace of it. He also told us some who find lost wallets take the cash and throw the wallet into a trash can. He was kind enough to search the trash can in the park, but with no success.\nOnce we accepted that reality, I started to write a list of all the onerous tasks that follow the loss of a wallet.\nAngry and frustrated, I said to my wife, \"This is what the world has come to. No one cares anymore except about themselves. You lose a wallet, and no one turns it in. Worse yet, they probably took your cash and credit cards with no remorse telling themselves it was an unexpected stroke of 'good luck.'\"\nMinutes later, there was knock at our front door. A couple from Washington, D.C., whom we had never seen before told us they were also visiting St. Michaels on Saturday. They discovered her wallet. Using the address on my wife's driver's license they drove to our house on their return to Washington and delivered it.\nThey refused any reward other than accepting a heartfelt thank you.\nAs I reflected upon that unexpected random act of honesty and kindness my thoughts turned to Anne Frank and words she wrote in her diary.\nWith a wisdom and eloquence well beyond her years she penned, \"It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.\"\nWith all due respect to the memory of Anne, I cannot fully embrace her thinking that people are truly good at heart. Many are, but some are not and never will be. This was confirmed by her death, the deaths of most of her family (all but her father who saved her diary) and at least six million other innocent people who perished in concentration camps during the holocaust.\nThat said, our experience with a lost wallet was a reminder the best way to honor the legacy of Anne Frank is simple. Not always easy but a most meaningful way.\nIn difficult times like these when dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality, we can and we should strive very day to be people who are \"truly good at heart.\"\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Solar on Eastern Shore farmland raise concerns\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVE KLINE | Section: Columns \n \n 497\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For 33 years, Eastern Shore Land Conservancy has welcomed each new year with a strong spirit of mission, to work each day to conserve this special place we all hold dear. This year is no different, as we return to the office after a restful break among family and friends.We are proud of our accomplishments in 2023 and move ahead focused on the many opportunities to protect the Eastern Shore in 2024.\nThis particular new year dawns with an urgent issue on the horizon: the siting of commercial-scale solar on Eastern Shore farmland. As the General Assembly prepares for the 2024 legislative session, solar siting policy is a high priority for many, as the state seeks to meet aggressive renewable energy goals, while also continuing to make progress on land conservation.\nGround-mounted solar projects can run from a few dozen acres to several hundred, and across the Potomac in Virginia, some individual solar projects are slated to consume thousands of acres of farmland, forest and open space. Some look to Maryland's Eastern Shore and see similar possibilities, with acre after acre of generally flat agricultural land suited perfectly for solar energy generation.\nBut Eastern Shore Land Conservancy is encouraging state lawmakers to move ahead cautiously. The University of Maryland estimates that our state has lost about half of its agricultural land in the last 50 years, and the American Farmland Trust estimates that in the coming decades, Maryland will likely lose more than 100,000 additional acres.\nWhile estimates vary widely, the legislated renewable energy goals that already exist seem likely to require between 10,000 and 20,000 acres of ground-mounted solar on agricultural fields. This doesn't include the acreage that could be affected by expanded transmission lines, substations, and other energy grid infrastructure.\nGiven the state landscape, one can imagine the majority of those acres — and perhaps the vast majority — could fall on Eastern Shore farmland, unless steps to ensure regional equity are taken. This is why, as legislators prepare to gather and address the business of the state, ESLC is advocating for a few priority policies related to solar siting.\nFirst, commercial solar development should never be allowed on state-held or co-held conservation easements.\nSecond, solar siting should be prioritized for the built environment. We shouldn't be losing some of the most productive soil in the world while warehouses and parking lots go unutilized.\nThird, for every acre taken out of production for solar development, solar companies should be paying a mitigation fee to conserve lands via permanent easement elsewhere.\nLastly, policies should be enacted to ensure Maryland's Eastern Shore counties aren't expected to bear a disproportionate burden of solar development in the coming years.\nAs we navigate the changing climate, the need to decarbonize our economy and transition to a renewable energy future is abundantly clear. But what is also abundantly clear is that climate change will make Eastern Shore food production even more globally important.\nWe should think long and hard before we place too much Eastern Shore farmland under a solar panel. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Turner gets life sentence for shootout with Calvert cops\n\n October 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 617\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A 23-year-old Prince George's County man who was convicted in June of attempting to kill a Calvert County deputy sheriff during an incident in December 2022 was given a life sentence Friday by a circuit court judge.In imposing Brandon Alexander Turner's sentence on 16 counts related to a high speed pursuit and shootout with deputies in a Huntingtown neighborhood, Judge Andrew Rappaport suspended all but 40 years of the life sentence for attempting to shoot and kill Deputy James Flynt.\nTwo counts of first-degree assault netted the defendant an additional 50 years with all but 18 year suspended, combined with 15 years with all but five years suspended for firearm possession with a crime of violence conviction. Those sentences will run consecutively, along with a three-year sentence for fleeing and eluding. Several other counts will run concurrently with the other charges.\nCombined, Turner's sentence is for over 60 years and due to the violent nature of the crimes he must serve at least half of that time behind bars before becoming eligible for parole.\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert H. Harvey Jr. (R) called the sentence \"fair and appropriate, given the magnitude of the crime.\"\nDuring Friday's sentencing hearing, Flynt addressed the court, reading a prepared statement.\n\"Mr. Turner is a coward,\" Flynt said, adding that his fellow deputies responding to the shooting scene in the Walnut Creek subdivision saved his life with their quick actions.\n\"This would have been a murder trial,\" Flynt said, adding that the leg injuries he sustained in the shooting still hamper his ability today.\n\"My life is changed forever,\" Flynt said. \"I've fought like hell to get back to full duty.\"\nNoting that he has undergone about 10 surgeries due to his wounds, Flynt told the court he will be on medication for the rest of his life.\n\"I will never be able to run like I used to,\" Flynt said. The deputy asked Rappaport to impose the maximum sentence on Turner.\nThe other two deputies involved in the shootout also told the court their lives were changed by the incident.\nDeputy Tyler Bowen also read a statement, calling the incident a \"traumatic, stressful event.\"\nIn a letter read into the record during the hearing, Deputy Anthony Aranda stated the incident has impacted his career and personal life.\n\"The sole focus must be on public safety,\" Harvey said of the sentence, adding that Turner's \"conduct was reprehensible. He has shown no remorse. He blames everyone else. He has been a disciplinary problem since his incarceration.\"\nThe defendant's attorney, Michelle Harewood, said her client suffers from a bipolar disorder for which he was not taking his medication.\nHarewood asked that Turner be sent to Patuxent Institute in Jessup so that his behavioral health issues can be addressed.\n\"If he had kept on his medication we wouldn't be here today,\" Shelton Turner, the defendant's father, told the court. The elder Turner added that his family and church \"prayed earnestly\" for Flynt after the shooting incident.\n\"I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me,\" Brandon Turner said in a written statement he read to the court prior to sentencing.\nThe Dec. 17, 2022, incident began in the Dunkirk area when the vehicle Turner and his wife were in was pulled over on the side of Route 4. Deputies had stopped and were about to search the vehicle when Turner fled. He led the deputies on a high-speed chase on Route 4 and several times fired a weapon out the driver's side window.\nFlynt, operating a patrol vehicle, disabled Turner's Kia with a precision immobilization technique. That's when the defendant reportedly began shooting at the deputies, who returned fire.\n\"You could have stopped at any time but you chose not to,\" Rappaport told the defendant before the sentence was imposed. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You return home from the former bored but refreshed. From the latter, you are enlightened but exhausted. You feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your holiday.In bridge, there are declarers who play as if they have their heads buried in the sand, and those who are all eyes open and aware of the possibilities.\nTheir differing approaches are highlighted in today's deal.\nNorth's raise to three notrump was correct, especially as East's opening bid had marked where the opposing cards lay.\nThe head-in-the-sand South won the first trick with the heart ace and immediately took the diamond finesse.\nHowever, East won with the king and cleared the heart suit. Declarer, with only eight tricks (two spades, two hearts and four diamonds), had to attack clubs. But East won immediately with the ace and cashed three heart tricks to defeat the contract.\nThe eyes-open declarer, who realized that East rated to have the club ace and diamond king for his opening bid, saw the right line. He crossed to dummy's spade king at trick two. Then he led a low club toward his king. East had to duck his ace, else declarer would have nine tricks via two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs. After winning with the club king, South took the diamond finesse, setting up nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, four diamonds and one club.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, maybe you agree with Eugene Ionesco: \"We haven't the time to take our time.\"At the bridge table, though, we should take our time.When the dummy appears, all three active players should pause to plan the campaign.Sometimes we must judge the right time to win a particular trick.Today's deal was declared by Roger Trezel, a Frenchman who died in 1986. How did he time the play in five spades after West had led the diamond king? West's bidding isn't recommended. First, why preempt when you might be able to make three no-trump? A two-diamond overcall is normal. Second, having jumped to four diamonds, West shouldn't have bid five.If he was willing to go to five diamonds, he should have bid it on the first round.Despite West's sacrifice, Trezel wasn't willing to assume that East had the club ace. To try to establish the heart suit without risking East's gaining the lead, Trezel ducked the opening lead.When West continued with a diamond to dummy's ace, declarer discarded a low heart. South drew trumps, cashed the heart ace, played a heart to dummy's king and ruffed a heart. Back to dummy with a trump, Trezel discarded two club losers on dummy's heart winners.Nicely done.At another table, South won the first trick with dummy's diamond ace. However, after drawing trumps ending in the dummy, he called for the diamond two. When East failed to put in the 10, South discarded a low heart and recovered from his earlier error. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carey Deeley, Jr. sentenced Todd Holtzman, 57, to 15 years in prison and suspended all but eight years of active incarceration after he pleaded guilty to robbery.The case against Holtzman stemmed from his role in robbery reported shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Monday, April 17.Police said a man, later identified as Holtzman, entered the Bank of America from its rear entrance on Goldsborough Street and confronted a teller, demanding bills in certain denominations.The teller told police that the man put a black grocery bag under the sneeze guard at the counter and asked for money without dye packs or alarms, according to charging documents. The teller also told police that the man said he would not hurt her.After the teller gave the man the money, the man exited the bank from the same entrance on Goldsborough Street.The total amount stolen was $3,210, police said in charging documents.Holtzman will have to pay Bank of America the full stolen amount as restitution.Video surveillance reviewed later showed Holtzman discarding the hoodie and sunglasses in the area of 25 N. Harrison Street, police said.A K-9 team from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office tracked him to the area of the Walmart on Elliott Road near the bus stop, but did not find him.A Delmarva Community Transit bus driver told police they recalled picking up the man from Walmart about 45 minutes after the robbery and dropping him off in Cambridge 30 minutes later.In the same hearing in Talbot County Circuit Court, Holtzman also pleaded guilty to fourth-degree burglary in connection to an incident at Walgreens about a week before the bank robbery. He received a three-year sentence, all of which was suspended, according to court filings.Following his release from prison, Holtzman will be placed on five years of supervised probation. He is barred from entering the Bank of America and Walgreens. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n \nA Talbot County Sheriff's Office vehicle is on the scene of a bank robbery in downtown Easton.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe downtown location of the Bank of America is situated on the corner of Washington Street and Goldsborough Street.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe rear door of the Bank of America opens on to Goldsborough Street. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is 25 years old, and I feel his marriage failed due to his misogynistic comments. Over the past couple of years, he started watching a YouTuber who has been giving him these ideas.If I'm honest, I also feel as if his actions are a result of my poor parenting.I am his mother, and I raised him to become the man he is today. Since moving in, he has been making my two daughters' lives much more difficult, and they will often get into arguments with him because he constantly talks down to them.My daughters tell me that I should kick him out of the house because he shouldn't be here, but I'm scared to do so because his finances are really tight right now due to his divorce and inflation.How do you suggest I navigate this situation? - Wayward Son DEAR WAYWARD SON: You may not be ready to put your son out of your house, but surely you can lay down the law.Establish ground rules for how you expect him to behave while he is there.That includes speaking respectfully to his sisters.Give him examples of how he has been talking to them and how hurtful his words have been. Go a step further and have a serious talk with him about what happened in his marriage, how you believe the YouTuber has negatively influenced him and even how you may have steered him wrong.

The girls would gather and compare the message candies from the boys.\nWhat fun that was. Then came high school, and the stakes were higher. The cute juvenile cards turned into single rose buds and candy.\nNo matter how you celebrate this special day — with or without candy — just tell that special person (or persons) \"happy Valentine's Day.\"\nHEART SHAPED PIZZA\n1 pound store-bought pizza dough, 1 tbsp olive oil (plus more for brushing), 16 slices pepperoni, All-purpose flour (for dusting), 1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce, 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella. Put the pizza dough in a medium bowl and coat well with the olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, put a large inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Fold a pepperoni slice in half and use a pair of kitchen shears to trim the edges into the shape of half of a heart. When you unfold the pepperoni slice, it will be a whole heart. Repeat this process with the remaining pepperoni, then set aside.\nDivide the pizza dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, stretch 1 ball of dough into a 10-inch round. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper, then slide the parchment and dough onto a second inverted baking sheet. Use a pair of kitchen shears or a paring knife to cut the pizza dough into the shape of a large heart, discarding the dough scraps. Spread half of the sauce on the dough in a thin layer and scatter half of the mozzarella on top. Top with half of the pepperoni slices. Use a pastry brush to brush the exposed edges of the dough with olive oil. Carefully slide the parchment onto the preheated baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make a second pizza.\nSURF AND TURF\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, 2 tbsps chopped fresh chives, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, 6 jumbo shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails intact), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon, 2 tsps chopped fresh thyme (plus 2 to 3 sprigs), freshly ground pepper, 6 slices pancetta (about 2 ounces), 1 10-ounce piece beef tenderloin (trimmed), sea salt, 8 asparagus spears, 1 tbsp unsalted butter. Pulse the parsley, chives and olive oil in a mini food processor until smooth. Thin with water, if necessary, and add 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and set aside. (This can be done up to 2 hours ahead.)\nToss the shrimp, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped thyme and pepper to taste in a bowl. Wrap each shrimp with a piece of pancetta. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the shrimp on a foil-lined broiler pan. Season the beef with sea salt and pepper, press the thyme sprigs into the meat and set aside. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Put the asparagus in a microwave-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and a pinch of sea salt. Heat a medium ovenproof skillet over high heat and add the butter. When the foam subsides, sear the beef until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold the meat and brown the sides. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook until a thermometer inserted into the beef registers 125 degrees for medium rare, about 4 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest while you cook the shrimp. Broil the shrimp until the pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, microwave the asparagus until tender, about 2 minutes. Slice the beef into 4 pieces. Serve with the shrimp, herb oil and asparagus.\nCLASSIC SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS\n1 pound spaghetti, 1 pound ground beef, 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley, 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (plus more for serving), 1 large egg, 2 garlic cloves (minced), Kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup onion (finely chopped), 1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes, 1 bay leaf, freshly ground black pepper.\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain. In a large bowl, combine beef with breadcrumbs, parsley, parmesan, egg, garlic, 1 tsp salt and red pepper flakes. Mix until just combined, then form into 16 balls. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate. Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to pot and cover. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve pasta with a healthy scoop of meatballs and sauce.\nVALENTINES DAY SUGAR COOKIES\n2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting), 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (at room temperature), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1 large egg. For Icing: 3 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsps milk, 1 1/2 tsps pure vanilla extract, red gel food coloring, pink gel food coloring, sprinkles (optional). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nFor the cookies: Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture and mix until well combined, scraping down sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, about 2 minutes.\nDivide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper until it's about 1/8-inch thick. Using heart-shaped cookie cutters, cut the dough and place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart (a small off-set spatula is really helpful when transferring the cookies). After both pieces of dough have been rolled out and cut, combine the dough scraps and re-roll and cut to utilize as much of the dough as possible. Bake until the cookies are just barely golden around the edges, rotating halfway through, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.\nFor the icing: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. The consistency should be similar to that of slightly thinned yogurt and should coat the back of a spoon. Adjust with additional confectioners' sugar or milk, if needed. Place 2 tbsps of icing into each of 2 small bowls. Add 4 drops of red gel food coloring to one bowl and 2 drops of pink gel food coloring to the other and stir until fully incorporated. Using a small spoon, drizzle a small amount of each color over the white icing and then repeatedly drag a toothpick through the icing until you create a marbled effect.\nWorking with one cooled cookie at a time, carefully dip it face-side down into the icing and allow any excess to drip off before placing the cooking back on the cooling rack. Add additional red and pink icing to the bigger bowl of icing as needed to maintain the marbling effect.\nHOMEMADE CANDY HEARTS\n1 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin powder, 1 tbsp light corn syrup, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp salt, 2 1-pound boxes confectioners' sugar (plus more for kneading), assorted food coloring (for tinting), assorted extracts (such as peppermint, strawberry or almond) for flavoring, cooking spray. Whisk the gelatin, corn syrup, vanilla, salt and 1/2 cup boiling water in a stand mixer bowl until the gelatin dissolves. Using the paddle attachment, beat in the confectioners' sugar on medium-low speed, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff, sticky dough.\nTransfer the dough to a clean surface and knead, adding more confectioners' sugar as needed (up to 1 cup), until the dough is smooth, pliable and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Flatten 1 piece into a disk. (Cover the rest with plastic wrap.) Add a few drops each of food coloring and extract to the center of the dough; fold in the sides and pinch closed, then knead until the color is distributed.\nLightly coat a large piece of parchment paper with cooking spray. Roll out the colored dough on the parchment until 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into hearts using 1-inch cookie cutters; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, using different colors and extracts. Let the hearts sit at room temperature, uncovered, until dry and hard, about 24 hours, flipping them halfway through. Write messages on the hearts using food decorating pens. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Elmer Davis in Ward 4.ROBERT RANKIN\nRobert Rankin is a newcomer to Easton politics, yet he displayed a firm grasp of the issues facing the town.\nWe liked his stands on issues, and most importantly, we liked that he admitted when he needed more information before voicing a conclusive opinion on issues we asked about.\nRankin's professionalism was evident. He called for a multi-faceted approach to increasing affordable housing in Easton, stressing the need to get more housing that is affordable for young families. His suggestions included working with developers to provide incentives, looking for more projects with townhomes and apartments, and redeveloping existing properties. It was a thoughtful answer.\nRankin also talked about his concerns on how new residential developments impact traffic, parking, schools and public safety. He wants an emphasis on a more strategic approach to approving future projects.\nHe wants to see more pedestrian-friendly and traffic calming features throughout the town. One suggestion included more crosswalks and sidewalks to better support pedestrian safety.\nHe was the only candidate to talk about increasing recreational opportunities on the east side of Route 50 where the majority of Ward 2 is located.\nHe suggested looking at retirement packages to assist in recruiting and retaining police officers in Easton.\nOne last note: Rankin has managed trade associations during his career. He knows what it is like to build consensus among many competing interests. Those will be valuable skills on the council.\nTHE REV. ELMER DAVIS\nThe Rev. Elmer Davis has long been a voice for people in the 4th Ward. He is also a voice of reason in the city during council meetings. Davis is not afraid to speak his mind, but his background as a preacher and pastor helps him look for common ground.\nDavis noted his position on the Town Council dais. As the Ward 4 council member, he is the last one called to voice an opinion on discussion topics. This gives him a chance to hear all of the other council members. Often his message is one of finding consensus in disparate views.\n\"I aim to continue bridging the gap between the council and the people I represent, ensuring every voice is heard and valued,\" he said.\nDavis was prophetic when he asked the question in our interview: \"What do we want Easton to be?\"\nHis multi-part answer is a walkable community with sufficient traffic infrastructure to keep the town moving. He suggested a bus service from hotels to downtown to get visitors to the shops that make Easton special. He was solution oriented.\nDavis called for ensuring that first responders have the equipment and resources to respond to any incident.\nHe offered the best option we have heard for building affordable housing in the community — having the town purchase land and then partnering with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity to build the homes, involving the future homeowner in the process.\nHe said the town needs affordable housing \"that people working at WaWa and McDonald's can afford.\"\nHe wants the council involved in approving housing projects in Easton. The Planning Commission, he said, should be making recommendations, not granting approvals.\nOne of his two opponents, Moonyene Jackson-Amis, would be our pick if Davis had not been doing such a fine job during his five years on the council. She is a former council member, an attorney and a community leader with multiple college degrees. She spoke passionately in our conversations about underrepresented communities in Easton. She continues to be a foundational rock in our town.\nBut Davis is our pick to continue his work on the council. He has done well these past five years, and he has become the face of Ward 4 with deep connections throughout the community.\nDavis has experience, civility and strong ties to the community. He talks about his close-knit connection to his roots in the community shaping his values.\n\"I believe there is still much work to be done to enhance the quality of life for our residents,\" Davis said. We agree, and the reverend is the person to do that. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Gov.Aruna Miller joined Special Secretary of Opioid Response Emily Keller, and local officials in Cambridge for the first of Maryland's Overdose Action Town Hall Series.During the event, Miller and administration officials heard directly from community members, who shared their ideas and insight on how the state can better address the overdose crisis.\"Overdose can impact any community - it doesn't discriminate by race, place, or socioeconomic status,\" Miller said. \"That's why the first step to finding comprehensive solutions to the substance use crisis begins by hearing directly from community members on what their specific needs are. Gov. Moore and I are dedicated to creating a seat at the table for everyone to come together to find pathways to recovery that truly leave no Marylander behind.\" The Opioid Operational Command Center recently announced the town hall series, through which Special Secretary Keller and OOCC staff will visit each of Maryland's 24 local jurisdictions.The tour is intended to give individuals an opportunity to speak about how the overdose crisis has impacted their communities and to discuss what more is needed to reduce overdose deaths across the state.\"It's going to take all of us working together to continue making progress in this fight,\" Keller said. \"From collaboration between state and local agencies to partnerships with community organizations, we all have a part to play. And that starts by listening to communities all across the state that have been affected by overdose, because we cannot do this work without them. Everyone's voice matters.\" The OOCC is beginning the town hall series with seven additional events scheduled for September, which is recognized as National Recovery Month for substance use disorders. For more details about the series and a list of upcoming events, visit Before-ItsTooLate.Maryland.gov/townhalls.According a statement released about the series, the Moore-Miller Administration is committed to holistically addressing the substance use epidemic and expanding access to care for individuals with substance use disorders, including through providing a 39 percent increase in support for substance use disorder services in the fiscal year 2024 budget. \n \n Caption: JOE ANDRUCYK/OFFICE OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n \nPictured l-r: Michael Coury, Cassandra Hershberger, Lt.

Other tasks included lowering the islands on the beach, removing temporary access to the islands and installing a grassy strip along the road to prevent sand from flowing into the road.\nThe work this month comes after Oxford's previous town manager signed off on the project's completion in June 2024.\nAt a town meeting in December, the Commissioners of Oxford announced the project had not been completed to the specifications Underwood and Associates originally presented. Commissioner Katrina Greer said she had brought together the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Underwood and Associates and the organizations that funded the project to ensure Underwood and Associates would address the town's concerns.\nWahl said there are a \"few concerns\" that Underwood and Associate's work this month did not fully bring the project into compliance with the project permit. She said she is working with regulating agencies to complete a list of those concerns.\nAlthough the project is still being evaluated to determine everything was completed, Wahl said the town is looking forward to having this phase of the project complete.\n\"We're doing everything we can to make sure that its purpose of providing stability on that coastal shoreline is adhered to,\" she said.\nCONCERNS FROM RESIDENTS\nThe Strand Beach project, which was approved in 2021, has stirred up questions and concerns from residents over the years.\nWahl said she has been meeting with residents on the beach to update them on progress. She said residents have raised concerns about the proximity of the dunes and evergreens to the road.\nShe said she has made a request to relocate the evergreens out of concern they are too close to the road. Regarding the dunes, Wahl said the town is preparing to install sand fencing to stabilize the area.\nFor resident Mac Sommerlatte, who lives next to the beach, a significant issue with the project remains.\n\"This is partially completed,\" he said.\nSommerlatte, who has been involved with the project since before 2021, said he has a contract with the town, which includes that the bulkhead on his property will be fixed as part of the project. He said only some of the bulkhead has been fixed.\nWahl told The Star Democrat the town's engineer examined the bulkhead on Sommerlatte's area and determined the \"whole area has been armored.\n\"And so there is no concern at all about stability of that location,\" she said.\nSommerlatte said he and his lawyer are reviewing information and considering filing a lawsuit against the town.\n\"It's not that I'm railing against anyone,\" he said. \"That's not what I'm trying to do. I just want them to complete the work that they agreed to before they started the project.\"\nWahl said she had no comment on the potential lawsuit.\nTHE NEXT PHASE\nThe town sees the shoreline project as the first phase in addressing the Strand. Wahl said once the town has signed off on the completion of the shoreline project, it plans to move on to raising the road and building a water retention area where the parking lot is.\n\"We definitely have to do some work to address the stormwater that is pooling on the roadway,\" Wahl said. \"So those are additional phases that the commissioners will be talking about here soon in a public meeting.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Main St., behind the spiral staircase and Little Free Library, the pantry operates on a \"take what you need, give what you can\" basis and is open 24/7. It provides nonperishable food, dry goods, feminine care products and diapers for Kent County residents and visitors.\nOriginally installed in 2021, the pantry was inspired by the grassroots \"Blessing Box\" movement that began in Arkansas in 2016 to help combat food insecurity without barriers or judgment.\nAshleigh Rogers, who installed the original pantry at her home, said the concept was also inspired by the philanthropy of chef José Andrés and the World Central Kitchen following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\"Sadly, the elements took their toll, and it was falling apart, so I applied for the grant from No Child Goes Hungry, and she had it on the way here within a day,\" Rogers said. \"I don't monitor it, so I'm not sure if needs have increased, but I do know it is used several times a day. The community has been so generous and has kept it stocked.\"\nCommunity members responded with donations during the \"Pack the Pantry\" drive held June 19–22 to help restock the upgraded pantry.\nFor more information, visit facebook.com/littlefreelibraryandpantryonmainstreet. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I was just picking up the baton,\" Gaddy said, explaining how he viewed his wartime military service as necessary and as a privilege. \"It was an honor. I knew what my purpose was. I was there to serve and protect our country.\"\nGaddy spent much of his tour of duty in battle zones and, as a result, he experienced that deep bond — that brotherhood — that soldiers have with one another because they're fighting side by side. \"You lived on a line and that puts you in a different frame of mind,\" he said.\nDespite the closeness that grows among soldiers in combat, there was little time for mourning in the heat of battle when a serviceman was killed, according to Gaddy. \"When one dropped out, you had to move up. Everything was too fast-paced. You had to keep the rest safe,\" Gaddy said.\nGaddy is blind today because metal fragments from a nearby explosion peppered his eyes in the midst of battle, sending him to a military hospital for about one week before he returned to duty.\nBut the damage to his eyes caused his vision to diminish gradually over the decades that followed Gaddy's honorable discharge from the Army in 1953. Gaddy's wife, Monolyne — they have been married 62 years — told the Cecil Whig that her husband has undergone 10 surgeries because he found himself plagued by cysts every time once-imbedded metal fragments surfaced on the front of his body.\nOn Sunday, Gaddy will be recognized for his wartime military service at Port Deposit VFW Post 8185 moments after the Memorial Day ceremony is completed, confirmed William Ward, who is the post commander. (Kevin Clark, a Gaddy family friend, was instrumental in bringing attention to Gaddy.)\n\"We are going to present him with a VFW coin at the end of our ceremony,\" Ward said.\nWard noted that Gaddy will be recognized during the portion of the program when the post honors \"our living veterans,\" which occurs after servicemen and servicewomen who made the ultimate sacrifice have been honored. During that latter part of the ceremony, Ward will present the Order of St. Michael medallion — a high honor — to one of the veterans affiliated with the Post 8185.\nAs for recognizing Gaddy, Ward commented, \"I will speak well of him, and I will speak well of his service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This time, they decided to answer.\"The gentleman said, 'I'm from animal control, and I have your cat, Butters,'\" Angelo Castellino said.\"I go, 'Is this some sort of punk call?'\" The Castellinos soon discovered it was not a scam - it was Riverside County Animal Control Officer Dalton Churchwell in California, who had found Butters in his yard late at night on Sunday, Oct. 3, and scanned him for a microchip.The couple had been living in San Diego and reported Butters missing 12 years ago in 2011. They had since moved to Stanwood in 2014 and lost hope of ever seeing the cat again.Luckily, the phone number attached to the microchip is the same one Shelley Castellino has today.\"I was astonished, it was kind of unbelievable,\" Angelo Castellino said.\"We figured that he was a meal for some coyotes.\" Angelo Castellino said he's unsure how Butters traveled so far, but that he was always trying to explore. The couple had adopted Butters and his brother, Barnacles, from a shelter in San Diego as kittens.After the news was shared, the Castellinos knew they wanted to bring Butters to their new home in Stanwood, but the expenses and logistics of flying a cat from California to Washington made for a tricky situation.The Animal Solutions Konnection Foundation, a California non-profit organization supporting the Department of Animal Services, soon heard the story.The organization decided to fund the cost of a flight to Seattle to see Butters safely return to his family.\"We were thrilled to work with the Department of Animal Services to make this reunion possible,\" said Carolyn Badger, president of the ASK Foundation, in a news release from Riverside County Animal Control.\"It was such a wonderful story, and we are very happy to know that Butters is home and safe with his family,\" she said.Butters' unlikely reunion finally happened Oct. 7, when Riverside County Department of Animal Services' longtime volunteer Larry Rudolph delivered Butters to the Castellanos in Seattle.Butters is now settled in his Stanwood home, and lives happily beside his brother, Barnacles, and the Castellinos' two dogs, Roscoe and Alita.Riverside Animal Services said Butters' defying of the odds was a testament to dedication and teamwork - but also a reminder to microchip pets to ensure reunification. \n \n Caption: ISABELLA LOY/STANWOOD CAMANO NEWS\n \nButters relaxes after his 12-year adventure.\n \nISABELLALOY/STANWOOD CAMA NO NEWS\n \nButters sits in the lap of Angelo Castallino. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Why are decoys so expensive? Artists, collectors share the value of carvings, community\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON – Decoys have long been used in hunting communities, but to the crowd at the Waterfowl Festival, the wood carvings serve more than just a utilitarian purpose.According to Cooper Rossner, a Talbot County decoy carver, the imitation birds and mammals can also be used as historic art pieces for nature lovers.\nAs a teenager in south New Jersey, Rossner was mesmerized by a carving demonstration in a natural sciences high school class. Rossner said right before his eyes, a carver turned a piece of wood into a Canada Goose.\nThis demonstration would be the first step into his lifelong passion for carving decoys. The carver at his school would soon become his mentor, and the following weekend he met an additional mentor during a Ducks Unlimited event.\n\"I was probably 15 years old, and here I am turning 30 in a week, and I'm still obsessed with it, still carving every chance I get,\" Rossner said. \"... carving is my world, and is my mind, and is my heart and soul. It puts everything that I love together: working with my hands, artwork, the history of it, the wildlife, the hunting aspect — it wraps it all up.\"\nThe hours of labor and craft artists like Rossner put into the carvings mean sometimes decoys come with a hefty price tag.\nJon Deeter, co-owner of Guyette and Deeter, a decoy auction firm, said his firm surpassed $200 million in total sales during 2020. In his experience, decoys at his firm would minimally be sold at $300. The most his firm had sold a single decoy for was $480,000.\nAccording to Deeter, pricing on decoys depends on a variety of factors. Vintage decoys made between 1850-1950 tend to be more valuable than contemporary decoys made after 1962. Additionally, the history and ownership of a decoy also impacts its value, similar to how provenance affects the value of fine art.\nRarity and originality also play a large role in the pricing of a decoy. The decoys made by renowned carvers like the Ward Brothers from Crisfield, Maryland can fetch prices in the six-figure range. Limited production, unique design or age can often command premium prices at auction, with the record being $1.144 million for a pair of decoys.\nDeeter emphasized that decoy collecting is an expensive hobby, but many collectors are not purchasing the high budget decoys and are there for the simple pleasure and admiration of skilly crafted decoys and the history behind them.\nTyler Bryan, an Eastern Shore collector and hunter, said he has around 75 decoys and enjoys the story and history associated with the decoys he purchases.\nBryan said he came to collecting naturally, influenced by his upbringing on the Eastern Shore and his fascination with nature. But one of the main reasons he continues to collect is the close community of decoy collectors.\n\"The decoy collecting community is really a fantastic group of people,\" Bryan said. \"It's tight-knit. Everyone knows each other. Most people know what everyone collects, and they're very helpful.\"\nBryan recommends decoy newcomers seek out a mentor because there are facets to collecting that will be much easier to someone if they have a trusted mentor to guide them along the way. According to Bryan, plenty of people within the decoy collecting community are happy to take on a mentee.\nRossner said decoy collecting often gets associated with much older people and can be seen as a \"dying craft,\" but in his eyes, it deserves more recognition for the layers of complexity it holds and the community that has welcomed him.\nRossner said he encourages anyone interested to spend time with other carvers and collectors and learn more about the shared love this community has for decoys.\n\"There's lots of people still doing it, but not as many as there once were,\" Rossner said. \"So you are living history when you're carving a decoy or you're doing an art form … you're doing something that's been handed down generation by generation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This colleague has known my daughter since she was a young child, so I feel extremely uncomfortable about this situation - and a little angry. My daughter is in her late 20s now, so the decision is ultimately up to her, but even if they were to hit it off, I know I'd never be OK with it. - Stay AwayDEAR STAY AWAY: Step back a moment and think about your colleague.What redeeming qualities does this man have as a person? What do you know about his relationship history? Has he ever done anything untoward regarding your daughter?Assess as much as you can about him and his character. It is understandably unnerving for this to be happening, but you are not in control of this.DEAR HARRIETTE: I have been a board member of my church for a long time, and it's a big part of my life. I am in a relatively new relationship with someone who is not interested in discussing church or religion and refuses to attend church-related events. This makes it hard for me to balance my personal life and my involvement in the church. It's important to me that they at least try to come to an event with me every once in a while. - Trying To CompromiseDEAR TRYING TO COMPROMISE: I understand why you want to make space for this person, but it doesn't sound like they are reciprocating. If your church life is that important to you, how are you going to make this work?

    "content": "Memorial proposed to recognize US Colored Troops in Centreville\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 699\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — For many years, Chris Pupke, past president of the Queen Anne's County Historical Society and advisory board member of the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center, has shared his knowledge of the county's African American history with the community through a series of lectures.His talks on the county's United States Colored Troops veterans, those enslaved and free men who gave their service and lives to the Union Army during the Civil War, have honored descendants and enhanced public knowledge of the county's diverse history.\nOn Aug. 13, joined by Jim Barnett, Tilghman Hemsley and Marcia Landskroener, Pupke presented a proposal to the Queen Anne's County Commissioners for the creation of a statue to honor the county's U.S. Colored Troops veterans.\nAccompanied by visual aids, his presentation featured the regiments and military campaigns in which Queen Anne's County free and enslaved men courageously served. In describing the invaluable service of the nation's Colored Troops veterans, Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that \"without the military help of the Black freedmen, the war against the South could not have been won.\"\nMore than 120 Queen Anne's County men fought with the 39th U.S. Colored Troops in the Battle of the Crater, part of the July 1864 Siege of Petersburg. They were trained to lead the attack until a last-minute change proved to be disastrous.\nWhen the U.S. Colored Troops were sent in to salvage the operation, they discovered the mission was lost. \"But they stood fast. These heroes stood in reserve, ready to do their duty, to honor their oath to the country, for which they paid a dear price,\" Pupke declared.\nSgt. James Bond of Centreville was enslaved by James Bordley of Centreville. Bond enlisted on Dec. 17, 1863 and was immediately made a sergeant. Bond may have been among the casualties of the Battle of the Crater.\nIn the fall of 1863, more than 125 men from Queen Anne's County enlisted in the 7th U.S. Colored Troops Regiment. The fight took them to the barrier islands from Hilton Head to Jacksonville. \"You know these men were brave,\" Pupke said. \"If you've ever walked the beach and seen the movie Glory, it was that kind of fight.\"\nParticularly poignant was the recollection by Col. James Shaw of the September 1864 Battle of Chaffin's Farm: \"Not a man faltered, but all who did not fall reached the work, charged boldly, and did all in their power to take it. ... they are all missing.\"\nBefore Queen Anne's County's Robert Riley enlisted in Company B, 7th U.S. Colored Troops Regiment, he had been enslaved on the Wye River. His Pension File included a surgeon's note of \"scars of whip on back when a slave.\" But as a soldier, Private Riley was present at the Battle of Fort Gilmer and among his fellow African American troops at Lee's surrender at the Appomattox Courthouse. Riley is buried in Chesterfield Cemetery in Centreville.\nTo honor these men who fought for their freedom and for their country, a group of veterans approached Tilghman Hemsley with the idea of creating a statue in their memory.\n\"I thought it was a very worthy idea,\" he stated. After walking the grounds of the Courthouse, Hemsley believed the best placement for the monument would be set in the same promenade as the memorial honoring county prisoners of war. The inscription would include the quote by Abraham Lincoln with the U.S. Colored Troops story engraved in granite.\nHemsley shared concept drawings of the proposed statue with completion for the monument expected for 2025.\nOn Sept. 7, from 5 to 7 p.m., the Queen Anne's County Historical Society will host a free fall picnic at Wright's Chance, located at 119 S. Commerce St. in Centreville. This event replaces the July event, which was postponed due to the intense heat experienced throughout the entire month.\nPupke will discuss Queen Anne's County US Colored Troops history. Kay Brown, a member of Bryan's United Methodist Church, will share church history and the success of Bryan's United Methodist Church in preserving a significant piece of Queen Anne's County history.\nThis opportunity was provided by a grant awarded to the church by the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust's African American Heritage Preservation Program. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It will serve Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nThe timing couldn't be better. Construction has finally begun next to the Talbot Community Center on a long-promised, modern inpatient medical facility — expected to open in 2028. Yet even the most advanced hospital is useless without skilled, dedicated staff.\nOur current Memorial Hospital depends heavily on traveling doctors and nurses. While competent and committed, they aren't rooted in our community. Many of us remember a time when our health care providers lived next door, when nurses were trained locally at the McQueen-Gibbs School, and when the hospital was the region's largest employer. The quality of care felt stronger because the staff had a personal stake in our well-being.\nMemorial Hospital once helped drive local economic growth. Quality health care made Talbot County attractive to retirees, professionals, and families alike — people drawn to both the lifestyle and the peace of mind that came with reliable, community-centered care.\nThe ITCH program aims to reignite that connection by:\nIntroducing health care careers early.Supporting local students through their journey.Building a skilled, homegrown workforce.Reconnecting the hospital and the community.\nThese are long-term goals, but the potential return on investment is huge — economically and socially.\nI urge my neighbors to support ITCH in any way they can. Whether through mentorship, donations or spreading the word, every effort matters. Let's bring the hospital back to the community — and the community back to the hospital.\nThanks to the Star-Democrat for shining a light on this promising initiative.\nHUGH M.

MICHAELS — A dog park in St. Michaels has been in discussion for almost four years. Now, with a special meeting planned, the town and commissioners are turning their attention to finding a location where the dog park can properly serve the community.The commissioners want to take into account multiple factors when decided the location of the dog park, including cost of building and maintenance, liability concerns, who is allowed to use the park, and limiting the amount of people affected by the noise and traffic.\nWhile a date is still being chosen for the special meeting, some dog owners in town said they were excited that the town is looking to get the ball rolling.\n\"It's exciting,\" said Jonathan Dietrich, St. Michaels resident and owner of two dogs, as he was walking his dogs through town. \"It's exciting as long as the location is right and everybody approves of it. I know it's been a very long journey, and it's pretty complicated, but it would be great. It would be great if we could get one but we'll see what happens.\"\nWhen dog park discussion started in St. Michaels four years ago, a group of lawyers in St. Michaels came together and created a group called \"The Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park.\"\nMember Devon Hewitt spoke at the August town meeting about donors for the dog park and potential locations.\nAccording to Hewitt the group of lawyers did research and came up with multiple locations, but the conversations fell through. After the new commissioners were elected, conversations began again.\nWhile determining the master plan for San Domingo Creek Park construction at the August Town Council meeting, discussion arose about a dog park being included in the master plan. The town commissioners decided not to include a dog park in the plan.\nOne of the reasons brought forward at the meeting was that if dog park plans were added to the master plan, the grant received from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources could be pulled back.\nWhile the location for the potential dog park is unclear, St. Michaels residents say they are ready to see movement.\nWhen Stacy Sass, a resident of St. Michaels, was asked how soon she would hope to see a dog park in St. Michaels for her dog Ginger to play in, she said, \"tomorrow.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The schedule would also promote building \"a more team concept.\"Dispatchers were \"100% for the 24-hour option,\" Sheridan said.\"I wouldn't sit here and talk to you today if I didn't believe this could be done in Caroline County,\" Sheridan said. \"I believe that people would want to work for Caroline County, and I think that instead of us always catching up and following everybody else, this gives us an opportunity to be a leader in the industry.\"Sheridan said that the shift changes, which he expected would implemented by January, were \"an operational issue\" that didn't require a vote by the commissioners, but he wanted \"to have an open line of communication\" with them.Included in its consent agenda appropriations, the Caroline County Commissioners unanimously approved several purchases for the department.On Sept. 12, the commissioners approved the purchase of four stretchers and four stair chairs from Stryker Sales Corporation for $114,641.At its Sept. 26 meeting, the commissioners approved the purchase of two Horton Model #603 ambulances for $316,801 each from FESCO Sales. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nThe Caroline County Department of Emergency Services recently purchased two new rescue units from FESCO Emergency Sales based in Elkridge approved by the commissioners. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It featured a textbook example for maintaining trump control.How should South play in four hearts after West leads the club king?Yes, I was the only North to rebid two hearts rather than one spade. However, I still like my call despite the poor trumps. It backfires when partner is 4-4 or 4-5 in the majors and not strong enough to bid again.Otherwise, she will rebid two spades, and I will raise. I win when she has five hearts and a weak hand. This way, we find our eight-card fit.Also, if she were to rebid two clubs over one spade, I would have to pass. Two hearts would promise some 16 high-card points. Note also that my wife's jump to four hearts promised at least five trumps. With only four, she would have rebid three notrump or fudged somehow!Finally, yes, she might have rebid three diamonds or four clubs (a splinter bid). I would have signed off with such useless trumps.The danger to four hearts is a bad trump break, which is almost a certainty at BBO!The correct technique is to win the first trick and to duck a round of trumps. You ruff West's club continuation and now cash the heart ace to see the expected 4-1 division. However, you play on diamonds to set up your side suit and cruise home, losing only three trump tricks.Starting with the heart ace and another heart is fatal here. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hollywood producer returning to Talbot roots for fresh perspective\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 377\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Chris Moore has many titles to his name: Harvard University Graduate, director, producer of \"American Pie\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" and one of his favorites: Talbot County native.Moore, after making his name in Hollywood, is coming back to the Eastern Shore to hear from the locals who helped him fall in love with film.\nAt the Oxford Community Center Thursday, Nov. 21, he will seek to engage in valuable dialogue with residents to better understand what movie lovers from across the country are wanting to see from the film industry.\n\"I could have been originally from somewhere else where, honestly, I wouldn't care what they had to say, but the thing about Talbot County, and what I love about coming back to it… is that it's a real slice of America,\" Moore said.\nMoore said he grew up going to the Avalon and loving the world that TV and movies took him to.\nAfter studying American history at Harvard, where he met and worked with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, he left for California, where he worked in the mailroom at an agency and later got promoted to literary agent before selling several scripts, including \"The Stoned Age,\" \"PCU,\" \"Airheads\" and \"My Girl.\"\nHe later went on to produce 1999 film classic \"American Pie,\" a breakout hit that launched Moore's career as a Hollywood producer.\nBut for Moore, a lot has changed since the 1990s, including the way that people watch films. Subscription-based streaming services have changed audiences' consumption of content by \"over producing\" content and making it difficult to gauge what people actually want to see, he said.\nMoore said he wants to take a step back and go back to his roots to better understand how to give audiences quality content. And for him there's no better sounding board than the people of the Eastern Shore.\nFor Moore, the event on Thursday will be interactive, funny and most importantly informative of what he believes best represents American culture and audiences.\n\"I don't want people to think this is like going to a college lecture,\" Moore said. \"We're going to have some fun and talk about movies and talk about entertainment, talk about fun stuff and in a way that people laugh and can engage and it can be a lively night.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Events include the Festival of Trees, which is held in the Tidewater Inn, as well as Carols by Candlelight, Santa's Workshop, Santa 5K Fun Run/Walk and a jewelry raffle.Every year, there is a theme for the festival, which is put on by the Friends of Talbot Hospice. This year's theme is \"Holiday Traditions.\" The trees will be decorated based on that theme, festival chairman Karla Wieland-Cherry said.\n\"It takes a year to plan. It's a lot of work,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"It's all volunteer work, all volunteers. And this is our 39th year. The big thing is the trees, so we have the trees sponsored by various businesses, organizations and individuals. And they can either choose to decorate the tree, or we also have a list of volunteers who will come in and decorate the tree.\"\nThe festival raises funds for Talbot Hospice. Wieland-Cherry emphasized the work of volunteers in raising hospice funds, as well as the family aspect of the weekend-long event.\n\"My children are involved, my son comes and volunteers, my daughter used to sing, my husband, he's the music chairman,\" Wieland-Cherry said.\n\" ... It's just a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season,\" she continued. \"I have such a blessed team of volunteers that work so hard to make this such a success.\"\nOn Friday night, the Preview Gala will kick off the festivities.

    "content": "One is enough for Queen Anne's\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Neither one needed a lesson on the importance of scoring first.\"The first team that scores is more likely to win than the second,\" Kent Island High head field hockey coach Laura Harding said.\n\"Getting that early goal, it sets the tone,\" Queen Anne's County head coach Shana Corder said. \"And I knew going into this game, I knew both teams were going to come out to win it in regulation.\"\nQueen Anne's and Kent Island played to a scoreless, double-overtime tie Oct. 19 before each team scored twice in a shootout in their regular-season finale.\nIt didn't take that long Tuesday afternoon.\nHaley Cole's goal on a corner just 7 minutes in proved enough, as the Lions blanked Kent Island, 1-0, for their second straight Class 2A East Region I championship.\nQueen Anne's (12-1-1) is seeded third in the 2A state tournament and will host No. 6 seed Centenniel (11-3) on Thursday at 4 p.m. in a quarterfinal.\n\"We're successful on our corners because our defense is so amazing,\" said Corder, whose team has won back-to-back Bayside Conference and regional titles for the first time in the program's history. \"And it pays off for us. And all you need is one to go in. And honestly going forward, this is how the state tournament's going to go. One goal is going to get it.\"\nOne goal was all that was needed on this beautiful autumn afternoon.\nQueen Anne's earned two corners in the game's first 5 minutes, then got a third with 7:20 remaining in the first quarter. Jordan Bilbo sent an entry pass to Ellee McLean, who quickly sent the ball back Bilbo. Positioned to the right of the goal, Bilbo centered a pass to an unmarked Cole about five yards from the cage. Cole didn't hesitate, quickly sweeping shot under the lunge of Bucs goalie Brynja Petursson and into the left side of the cage for a 1-0 lead.\n\"We've been working really hard on corner execution, and every practice it's been getting better and better,\" Cole said. \"And I got the perfect pass from Jordan and happened to be the one. It was really a team effort. We were all in there to get it done and earn the corner. I just happened to be the one lucky to tap it in.\"\nThat was plenty for Queen Anne's defense.\nSince yielding a goal to Crisfield on Oct. 7, the Lions haven't surrendered a goal over their last six games — not counting the 1 vs. 1 against the Bucs in the regular-season finale. Corder again played Cassidy Alexander (four saves) and Caroline Kimball (two saves) two quarters each Tuesday. And even though Sydnie Harris — one of the new mainstays on a rebuilt defense — was not 100%, she played tough minutes along with linemates Sydnee Carr and Mel Gill. Corder dropped forward Aly Edwards back on defense when Harris needed a breather.\n\"I just knew if we scored first I knew we could do it because my defense is amazing, and they're peaking,\" Corder said of a unit that has now logged 10 shutouts this season. \"They are peaking right now. They've done well all season.\n\"I had to put one of my forwards back to defense,\" Corder said of Edwards. \"But the kids listen to what we tell them in practice and they know everybody's role. So we're just able to be successful even being sick. I'm super proud of the girls.\"\nHarding was also proud of her defense, which limited an opponent to one goal or less for the 11th time this season. Petursson made seven saves, including a stop McLean's penalty stroke with 7:45 left in the second quarter, and made another save when the Bucs were down a man for 2 minutes in the third quarter.\n\"We made the save and we battled back on all the corners down here in the first half,\" said Harding, whose team stopped Queen Anne's on 10 of its 11 corners.\nKent Island (9-4-1) almost pulled even with 2:50 remaining, when a drive in the circle missed connecting with Ellie Burnside at the post.\n\"They have a good defense,\" Harding said of Queen Anne's. \"And they've got a great goalie. It's going to be a big battle again next year, too. I think we'll be right back here again next year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold. She probably has not had a \"but if not\" moment yet in her young life thus far, but I have no doubt she is developing the character and strength to face the challenges she knows are coming. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But her first weeks, she said, will be dedicated to completing a listening tour.Her latest post was the Barry Art Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, where she was executive director. Now she has a new challenge with helming the Academy.\n\"Every time I see a challenge, I lean in,\" Kasic said.\nShe was not entirely unfamiliar with the Academy Art Museum before applying for the job.\n\"When Eric Neil left the Academy in 2012 or 2013, he became the director of the Chrysler Museum of Art, and I was the director of the Chrysler Museum Glass Studio, which was like an annex,\" Kasic said.\nShe's been impressed with the museum's existing work and potential.\n\"When you break it down, there are classes. There are programs and exhibitions. There is collections. There is fundraising. There are galas. It is wild how much happens here with so little. I think this place is doing a great job of hitting a lot of audiences,\" she said.\nKasic is excited to work with the staff to continue these efforts.\nKasic has past in glass blowing, in which she said she learned about collaboration and teamwork. She created Cirque de Verre (circus of glass), which traveled around the United States to museums and art spaces that had glass blowing furnaces.\n\"Glass I love because you work in teams. It is hot. It is visceral. There is a lot of strong communication skills,\" Kasic said. \"I like things to be immersive, multisensory and interdisciplinary. When you think of olfactory, that is how you access your deepest memories. Music can change your mood in a minute. Art can do that as well.\"\nKasic has a masters degree from Rhode Island School of Design and has done residencies at Penland, Oxbow, Pilchuck and in Australia.\nAfter the Chrysler she moved to Vermont to start a family. She ended up being the director at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, which celebrates sustainable design and craft.\nThe siren song of Norfolk brought her and her family back to the Chesapeake, where she joined the team at the Barry Museum. She says it has become the glass art capital of the East Coast. There, Kasic helmed a 25,000 square foot expansion and closed out a $23 million campaign.\nNow at the Academy Art Museum, she sees a collaborative community that brings Plein Air, The Craft Show and the Waterfowl Festival into the institution. She also has a clear-eyed approach to what the Academy can offer the community.\n\"I would like to see more of our permanent collection on view. We have so much that exists but people don't get to see,\" she said.\nEven with these plans, she realizes that there is a lot of collaborating to be done.\n\"It is important to say how invested the board is in this place. I have seen more board involvement and more community investment than any other organization I have been in. People are so dedicated. It is really remarkable and it speaks to the strength of this place,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Participation is free, with pre-registration needed at christmasinstmichaels.org/events.\nThe 2024 Christmas in St. Michaels Collectors Ornament has also been announced and is the 21st in the series. This year's ornament depicts the Chesapeake deadrise workboat with its crew and a friendly canine companion. The image was provided by St. Michaels artist Sherry Smith.\nThe boxed ornament is available for purchase at select local retail shops and the weekend-long Christmas in St. Michaels Marketplace and Sweet Shoppe. Online purchases can be made at www.christmasinstmichaels.org/ornament.\nThe deadrise workboat has been a staple among Chesapeake watermen for decades. \"Deadrise\" refers to the almost flat, V-shaped hull that provides a shallow draft to accommodate the waters in creeks and rivers of the Eastern Shore. Boats range from 25-45 feet in length and are powered by large, inboard four- or six-cylinder engines, usually diesel-fueled.\nWorkboats typically sport women's names on the transom or bow, paying tribute to wives and daughters. Others, such as the one in this ornament, refer to the town, river or creek the boat calls home port.\n\"It is typical to see dozens of these deadrise workboats plying the waters of the Eastern Shore in the wee hours of the morning as they seek the day's catch, returning to the pier in the early afternoon to get their catch to market,\" says Christmas in St. Michaels Chair Pat Martin. \"We're honored to add this limited-edition ornament to our collection to pay tribute to watermen and their boats in the St. Michaels area and the Chesapeake Bay region at large.\"\nEvent details, online ticket and ornament purchases, and more about Christmas in St. Michaels are at christmasinstmichaels.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We have cities that have been ruled by Democrats for decades and they are the worst in the nation and if you don't think so just look at Baltimore, Chicago, L.A. and New York to name a few.How long will people be tied to one party that they would rather see our nation go down the tube then to do what is right for our children and grandchildren.If we continue in the direction that we are going, undermining our Constitution and Bill of Rights, we will be a dictatorship with one ruling party taking away our guns, closing our places of worship, giving us run away inflation and forcing us to buy total electric.

They're a very talented, dedicated vocal group and they love to perform at area venues during the holidays.\"\nIn fact, the group's two performances this Saturday at Mrs. Moo's holiday open house and again the following morning at Bulrushes Cafe will put the finishing touches on a very busy month for the carolers.\nLast Saturday, Dec. 9, the Cabaret Carolers performed for three hours at the Holidays Tree Lighting in Prince Frederick and several days earlier they performed at Asbury Solomons retirement community.\n\"The kids love to perform any time of year, but especially around the holidays,\" said Reisman, who has been associated with the group since its inception in 2001. \"They enjoy rehearsing together and they can't wait to perform.\nThey usually do three sets of six to eight songs beginning at the top of each hour.\"\nWhile most residents do not associate ice cream with the winter months and upcoming Christmas and New Year's Day holidays, Mrs. Moo's is going to sweeten the pot for the local group by unveiling an ice cream sundae named in their honor on Saturday.\nReisman admits that it is a fitting tribute to a youthful group that provides holiday cheer each winter.\nAly Cross, who has directed the group in \"Newsies, Jr.,\" \"A Christmas Story,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Once On This Island Jr.\" and will be directing \"High School Musical\" in the spring, also teaches all of the acting classes each semester.\nIn the spring, the acting classes will be held at the College of Southern Maryland's Prince Frederick campus.\n\"This group is very, very unique,\" Cross said.\n\"We have a great group of kids. There's no pressure on these kids to memorize things. It's a great chance for them all to sing Christmas carols together.\nThey're learning a little bit of choreography to go along with the songs.\nWhen they performed at the Asbury Solomons they were overwhelmed by the response from the audience.\" \n \n Caption: The Children's Theatre of Southern Maryland Holiday Cabaret Carolers will be performing concerts this Saturday afternoon at Mrs. Moo's in Prince Frederick then again on Sunday morning at Bulrushes Cafe.\n\n PHOTOS COURTESY BRYN CROSS\n\n The Children's Theatre of Southern Maryland Holiday Cabaret Carolers gives children a chance to showcase their talents. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Multicultural after-school program lets students learn through taste\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Thursday evening, over a dozen fourth and fifth graders walked through Bonheur Ice Cream and Pie in downtown Easton and learned from local chefs of the profession of devoting themselves to sweets.These students are part of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center After-school Program, a program designed to enrich Hispanic elementary school students of Talbot County.\nDuring the program, students focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics; reading skills; and food supplement nutrition education to ensure they are educated and well prepared for lessons inside and outside of the classroom.\nEstela-Vianney Ramirez, assistant director of the after-school program, said she has been working with the program for over a decade, and it is a beautiful experience to help expand the world for these students.\n\"It's very rewarding to teach the class,\" Ramirez said. \"Those memories really stick in their, the students', minds and enable them to actually give out to the community, too, because some of our volunteers in our after-school program were our students who went through the program 10 years ago.\"\nRamirez notes that she sees her former students working in offices and throughout the Eastern Shore, and she is happy to be a part of their development.\nDuring the tour of Bonheur, Chef Tyler Heim brought the students to the kitchen and explained the process of making ice cream and the work that goes into every pint. One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics — from prep to final product — exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Howard Anthony Community Service Award.For All Seasons is a behavioral health and rape crisis center. They are also the only agency in Talbot County doing this work in Spanish and English.\nThey bring in 20 to 25 new people a week for their new no wait five-days-a-week services. Because of COVID-19 they got skillful at telehealth and now offer services in all 24 jurisdictions in Maryland.\nAccording to Beth Spurry, the president and owner of Wye Finanicial Trust and a mentor of Dorman's, in the past decade, Dorman has taken the organization from just 24 employees to over 100, most of whom are women.\n\"Because those nearly 100 employees that are meeting the mental health, the rape crisis needs of our community are the employees that are handling the toughest of the tough and doing it with a smile on their face. I have a smile on my face because of them. So thank you for this award,\" Dorman said.\nA few days after the award was announced, she reflected.\n\"It is their largest award. I was first a part of Rotary when I first got out of college. It was called a group study exchange,\" Dorman said. \"The group study is a professional exchange. I was given the opportunity to apply to be a part of a group that traveled to Japan. I was there for six weeks. I visited higher ed places in the Ibaraki Prefecture.\"\nIt is a specialized award. You cannot have been in Rotary for 10 years. You have to have lived and worked in the community in which you were serving for 10 years.\n\"It is a big deal for them. They have an opportunity to pick one person from the community. So I was blown away when he (Tom Hill) called me and told me that it was going to be me,\" Dorman said.\n\"I think it brings to light the importance of living through service in your community. That is the core of who I am, as far as servant leadership. I am as good as the team I have put together. We continue to serve in the community. It spurs a conversation about the importance of service no matter how big or small,\" Dorman said.\nFor All Seasons hosts many events throughout the year, like the backpack giveaway and Frosty's Holiday Village, that reach thousands of people.\n\"In all of that, the biggest piece for me is providing an example for my children, for women, for girls, for young people. My kids know I am busy and on my phone all the time, but they always know I am doing really important work. And that plants in them that they can be someone in the community,\" Dorman said.\nShe said she has a supportive team that helps her. Starting with her husband and her kids, Dave and Melinda Finley at Anchor Church on Goldsboro, Alice Ryan of the Women and Girls Fund, and Spurry.\n\"I was given a huge gift at the awards ceremony in having her (Spurry) be the person to present me the award. Beth has not only been a guiding light, but a pretty strong mentor. She will say, 'I think you can do better and here is why.' She has been an incredibly encouraging mentor,\" Dorman said.\nShe said this was a really important moment in her career.\n\"If all fell away tomorrow, this is the community that has supported me as I am supporting them. I will have a part of the Anthony family legacy forever and be able to say here is the impact I had in the community, which I call home,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shelly was part of the Terrapin Program through Maryland Environmental Service, the agency heading up the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island.\nAs part of the research program, Shelly spent her first year growing from a tiny hatchling to a young terrapin at Kent County Middle School before being release back on Poplar Island.\nFor Copeland, this was his first time raising a terrapin, an experience he described as \"amazing.\"\n\"Not only was it truly great for the students to learn more about terrapin ecology and physiology, it was also a good opportunity for students to learn about the environmental impacts we as humans impose on literally our backyard, the Chesapeake Bay,\" Copeland said.\nCawthorne said she loved every minute helping raise Shelly and was very thankful for the experience.\n\"Seeing the look of awe and excitement in the students' faces whenever Shelly made her way to my classroom was nothing short of wonderful. The students learned so much about terrapins and we were very sad to see her go,\" Cawthorne said.\nFor more than a decade, the State of Maryland has been rebuilding Poplar Island.\nIn its day, there were families that called Polar Island home. It also hosted a getaway used by the most powerful people in Washington, D.C., including U.S. presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\nThe waters of the Chesapeake eroded Poplar Island so much so that by 2000, it was predicted the entire island would soon be washed away.\nThe Poplar Island restoration site is still under construction. While no people live on the island, many species of wildlife now call it home — or at least a stop on their migratory route.\nScientists led by biologist Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University are conducting a study of terrapins on Poplar Island. They locate nests and count and measure eggs.\n\"A lack of land predators, undisturbed sandy shorelines, and a variety of habitat types make Poplar an ideal terrapin nesting site,\" the Terrapin Program website states.\nWith around 800 diamondback terrapins — the state reptile of Maryland — hatching annually on Poplar Island, the researchers collect about 150 eggs each year and give the juveniles to schools raise.\nThis \"head start\" program aims to determine if this level of human involvement in terrapins' early stages of life gives them a better chance in the long run of surviving in the nature world, according to the Terrapin Program site.\nIt also gives students the opportunity to more personally engage with the Bay's ecosystem.\n\"Through this program, students are playing an important role in relevant, cutting-edge research focused on the conservation of the species,\" the Terrapin Program site states. \"The combination of scientific applications, hands-on involvement and the emotional attachment to the terrapins provides a unique opportunity to inspire a meaningful connection with the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nThrough releasing Shelly back into the wild, Cawthorne and Copeland both said they hope the middle school students learned that any action they take, no matter how large or small, can have a huge impact on the health of the Bay.\nThe field trip was funded in part by the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund.\nPart of Mid-Shore Community Foundation, the education foundation fund helps cover the costs of extended field trips, provides mini-grants to teachers and more.\nFor details about the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund, or to make a donation, visit www.kent.k12.md.us/Foundation.aspx. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But after some discussion from town residents, rules regarding chickens could change.\nAccording to town staff, the conversation has been ongoing through the past couple of months, but it gained traction after residents began preparing petitions and presentations on chickens.\nMason Sparks, a resident of the town, gave a presentation to the town on chickens at the commissioners' August meeting. At Monday's meeting, Sparks said that he knocked on 471 doors and received 178 responses from residents, 87.6% of whom were in favor of allowing chickens.\nResident Andrew Meyer also spoke on Monday in favor of chickens being allowed within the town limits.\n\"I just want to start by saying that I strongly support allowing chickens in town,\" Meyer said. \"There's towns and cities all over the country that currently allow chickens. Today, more and more people want to know where the food's coming from, and raising backyard chickens for eggs is one way that people can ensure that they have healthy raised source of food.\"\nMeyer addressed some concerns he said he has heard about chickens.\n\"As far as noise, hens are no louder than barking dogs or children playing. As far smells, a small backyard coop that's kept clean would have minimal smell. It's no more disturbing than any other farm smells that town is currently surrounded by. I think the benefits outweigh any small disturbance that would cause to any neighbors around the town.\"\nAfter hearing from residents, the commissioners voiced their opinions.\n\"It seems like the residents are definitely in favor,\" Commissioners Chad Leister said. \"I know that I personally reached out to all our neighboring town councils and spoke to them, mainly just to see, some I guess bad feedback they would have for the chickens, and, as you know, there wasn't really a whole lot of it. So, I think I'm willing to be okay with it.\"\nThe commissioners made a motion to work on the legal wording of the town code to draft an ordinance to allow chickens within the town. The ordinance is expected to be presented at the next meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Playing for money, North would have doubled five hearts and collected 300 points.However, worried that most pairs would buy it in four spades, North pushed on to five spades.Clearly, South had to avoid a club loser, and he knew to leave the key suit as late as possible. He ruffed the second heart, drew one round of trumps and played a diamond to the king. East took that trick and played another trump. Declarer won on the board, cashed the diamond jack, crossed to the spade queen and played off the diamond queen and 10, pitching clubs from the dummy.It was time to work out the club position. What had South learned?East was known to have started with three spades and five diamonds. The bidding also strongly suggested that East had four hearts. If so, his hand distribution was 3=4=5=1.Singularity rules. Declarer cashed his club king and ran the club jack, chosen to encourage an unwise cover.Well counted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Maryland Retailer's Alliance, more than 70% of Marylanders now live in jurisdictions with carry out bag policies in place.\nOn July 20, 2023, Centreville Town Council passed the ordinance to ban single-use plastic carry out bags within Centreville town limits.\nFor Town Council President Ashley Kaiser while the ban addresses single-use plastic bags the spirit of the ordinance is to encourage the use of reusable bags and eliminate the reliance on plastic bags, many of which end up polluting our highways and waterways.\n\"Consumers have an opportunity to play a significant role in the implementation of this bill. I don't think that anyone who is shopping at a local business wants to burden a local business, but instead wants to support them. If a paper bag fee is going to be a problem for you, decline the bag,\" says Kaiser. \"There are things people can do to change their behavior like making a point to remember to always carry reusable bags with them,\" she adds.\nFollowing that philosophy, the Town of Centreville launched a \"Bring Your Own Bag\" campaign in October in coordination with Plastic Free QAC. The campaign included specially designed reusable bags with a rack card featuring information on the bag ban as well as tips for how to remember to bring your bag to your next shopping trip.\nBags were handed out at Centreville Day in October and at the Centreville Farmers' Market Heck with the Malls market day in December and were made available at Town Hall. A limited supply of Town reusable bags and vintage farmers' market reusable bags are currently available for consumers to pick up at Centreville Town Hall from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nThe Centreville single-use plastic bag ordinance stipulates that retail establishments with the exception of food service facilities \"shall charge, collect and retain at least 10 cents for each paper carry out bag that it provides to a customer.\"\nExceptions to the ordinance includes, but are not limited to:\nNonprofit fraternal, civic, war veterans, religious, or charitable organizations and fire companies can still use plastic carry out bags.\nDue to cross contamination concerns restaurants may not allow customers to use their own reusable bags. Restaurants will provide paper bags, but will not charge a paper bag fee.\nThe Centreville Market's Market and cottage food businesses can continue to use plastic.\nPharmacies and opticians will not charge a paper bag fee for prescription items.\nConsumers and business owners who want to read the full text of the ordinance and frequently asked questions can visit townofcentreville.org and type \"plastic bag ban\" in the search window.

The event, held on the second floor of Hodson Hall, featured renowned speaker Heather Mizeur, who delivered the lecture \"Disagreement is Democratic.\"\nThe lecture, free to the public, included an introduction to the new PoliTalks leadership: co-presidents Charlotte Schurman and Grace Walsh. \"We feel confident in our team to take the group forward,\" Schurman said during a catered meal and Q&A session following Mizeur's discussion.\nSchurman and Walsh are continuing the tradition of PoliTalks: to provide a safe, respectful forum for political education and conversation.\nHook reflected on the club's success during a politically charged climate, noting that he was pleased to see people with differing views engage in peaceful discussions about polarizing issues during the Trump administration.\nMizeur, a former Maryland state delegate, candidate for Congress, and CEO and founder of WeAreOne Alliance, led these discussions. This was her second time giving the lecture. She discussed the guiding principles she learned while reaching across the aisle and campaigning.\nJust as she did at the Toll Science Center on Oct. 17, 2024, Mizeur introduced her mnemonic device: **RESPECTFUL**, which stands for Reciprocity, Engagement, Sovereignty, Pause, Equanimity, Curiosity, Trust, Freedom, Unhook, and Listen.\nIn this session, she focused on the \"S\" — **Sovereignty**.\nMizeur defined sovereignty as \"the ability to stand in your own agency.\" She explained that how we respond to political disagreements, while maintaining self-control and understanding, is key to sovereignty.\nMizeur stated that the nation's collective sovereignty is currently under assault. She criticized the Trump administration for trampling due process and weaponizing fear and control, leading to the dehumanization of people.\n\"The initial response to these policies,\" Mizeur said, \"is to react with fear and frustration, instead of responding with sovereignty, which is a conscious choice rooted in integrity.\"\nSovereignty, Mizeur explained, is a calming force that leads us to a different path, one that cannot be legislated or controlled.\n\"It's not earned, but inherited,\" Mizeur said.\nShe offered lessons on how to reconnect with one's own inherited sovereignty.\nMizeur emphasized that sovereignty does not mean being a doormat. It requires setting boundaries, practicing a firm \"yes\" and \"no,\" and avoiding separation from others, which leads to isolation and despair. She encouraged practices like journaling, speaking with a friend or partner, and engaging in joyful activities to help individuals maintain sovereignty.\nMizeur also emphasized the importance of listening to the body's warnings and stepping back from social media to detox and nourish oneself.\n\"Sovereignty is a practice, not a switch you turn on and off when needed,\" Mizeur added.\nShe said practicing these principles brings deeper joy, freedom, and can spark real change in hearts and lives.\nThe discussion continued over a catered dinner, where guests of all ages discussed how to apply these principles in their own lives. Some shared stories of losing friends or family members over political differences and blocking people on social media. Tensions over political debates had surfaced in families.\nOne attendee suggested that protests, such as the \"Hands Off Rally,\" should include what participants are fighting for, in addition to what they oppose, emphasizing the positive.\nA few attendees remarked that they no longer view people with opposing views as \"enemies.\" A central lesson from Mizeur's talk was to lead with curiosity and learn from everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.\nOthers acknowledged that life experiences can lead to differing viewpoints, and sometimes, religion plays a role in those differences.\nOne woman pointed out issues on which everyone could agree, such as the need for more jobs and affordable housing.\nHook, who founded PoliTalks after witnessing the need for peaceful discussions on campus following a Washington College lecture by conservative speaker Robert George, expressed his satisfaction with the club's success. George had cut his speech short on Sept. 7, 2023, due to protests.\n\"This is the best possible way we could have ended with the club,\" Hook said.\nHe thanked everyone involved, especially Mizeur, for her nonprofit work in coalition building through community partnerships. \"Heather brings a unique narrative to the conversation around political dialogue that we believe is important for our community to hear,\" Hook said.\nFor those who missed Mizeur's talks, they can sign up for her newsletter and receive information about her 2025 programming at [https://www.weareonealliance.org/](https://www.weareonealliance.org/).\nWhat's next for PoliTalks under new leadership?Schurman noted that environmental justice is a strong focus across campus. She plans to invite Serena C. McIlwain, Maryland secretary of the environment, for a future lecture.\nAs they call for more student involvement, PoliTalks plans to hold monthly meetings.\nSeveral members of the Chestertown government attended the event, including Mayor David Foster and Council Member Sheila Austrian of Ward 1. Austrian found the discussion eye-opening and thanked the college and PoliTalks for reaching out to the community in such a meaningful way. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cross St in Chestertown, has found an answer.\nTheir answer lies in a chalkboard displayed on the fence outside of their church for all to access. The board, entitled \"Today I pray for,\" was an idea that Rev. Claire Nevin-Field brought from her former church in Philadelphia.\nShe said the board, \"was a way to hold up the concerns, griefs and joys of the community around us, both so we could pray for those things people listed and so they would know we cared about them.\"\nIn November 2023, the board made its debut on the church fence. Parishioners Andrew Field and Elizabeth Riedel built the board. Nevin-Field said when the board gets full, they take a picture of it, pray for each spot and erase it.\nThe prayers are also announced every Sunday during morning service.\n\"The board has been warmly received. Anyone who has commented to me has been grateful for the chance to put a prayer 'out there,' and the people here at Emmanuel have been glad that we can offer this to the community. If we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, we have to see every single person, every blessed person, as beloved of God and so we want to honor and respect our neighbors by praying for those things that are of concern to them. It is an acknowledgement that we are part of the community of Chestertown, Kent County, Maryland … and that what affects one of us affects each of us.\"\nNevin-Field shared, \"I have been struck, both here and in Philly, by how people take this seriously. We have not had issues with people writing obscenities or things intended to harm a person/group of people. It seems that people take it in the spirit it is intended-to hold our neighbors in our hearts and prayers, and to share all the stuff of life together.\"\nWho is using this board? The reverend says, \"it is hard for me to say exactly who is writing on the board, but I do know it is a mix of people who come to church here and people who do not. It can be really poignant — people writing everything from someone they know and love, to refugees or prisoners or peace. It seems people appreciate the chance to name someone or something so others know and can pray with them. The things written on the board are read in the morning services every Sunday during the prayers — so we pray for everything and everyone listed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She knew the man. He drugged her before raping her, she said.\nAfter a few weeks of \"throwing up constantly\" and \"crying uncontrollably,\" Cheaton went to rehab to get treatment.\nShe said it was her therapist that told her she didn't have to face her assaulter in the Bradford House halls everyday, and there were resources that could keep him out of the building.\nAlthough Cheaton said she didn't call the police after she was raped, she did get restraining order against her rapist later on.\nBut despite the restraining order, Cheaton said she would still see her rapist in the halls at Bradford House.\nUnder the Violence Against Women Act, a housing provider may evict or terminate the assistance of a perpetrator of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Notice of Occupancy Rights under the Violence Against Women Act.\nAccording to the notice, those who have experienced domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking must have the option to stay in their subsidized housing and can request an emergency transfer from the housing provider for safety reasons.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat, Millennia Housing Management — which manages Bradford House — said the Bradford House property management team sends violations to anyone residing at the property that is the cause of an assault or theft.\nCheaton said she is not the only tenant that has been raped in the building. And this is not the only time Cheaton said she has been put in danger at Bradford House. She said she has also been held at knifepoint, threatened and assaulted on the property.\nIn one instance, Cheaton remembers taking her dog outside a few hours after midnight.\n\"I had just shut that door,\" she said. \"And somebody standing way down there at the end of the building was hollering at me.\"\nCheaton, who said she doesn't leave the door to the building open for anyone, said the person was telling her to leave the door open.\nShe said the man got in her face and threatened to shoot her. By the time police arrived, he was gone, Cheaton said.\nAccording to a Cambridge Police Department calls for service report requested by the Star Democrat, of the 1,099 calls for service to Bradford House made between Aug. 1, 2021, and Feb. 21, 2024, 18 were for reports of threats.\nAfter being threatened outside the building, Cheaton — who has had experiences with substance abuse — said she moved out of Bradford House for about a month to live with her daughter.\n\"To stay sober in a building like this is very, very difficult,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Diving into National Water Safety Month\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CAROLINE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT | Section: Life \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n May is not just about blooming flowers and warmer weather; it's also National Water Safety Month, a crucial time to raise awareness about the importance of water safety, particularly for children.As families gear up for pool parties, beach vacations and lazy days on the river, it's essential for parents to prioritize safety to ensure that every aquatic adventure remains a fun experience.\nSupervision is Key\nFirst and foremost, maintaining constant supervision is paramount when children are around water. Whether it's a backyard pool, a nearby river or the ocean, a watchful eye can make all the difference.\nTake turns designating a specific adult in your family or group as the assigned water watcher, and ensure they are not distracted by phones or other activities. Being present and attentive can be the most effective preventive measure against potential accidents.\nSwim Lessons\nEnrolling children in swim lessons early on is an investment in their safety and confidence around water.\nProfessional instructors can teach essential water skills, instill proper techniques and build a foundation for a lifetime of safe swimming. Caroline County Recreation and Parks, the YMCA and private swim instruction companies in the region offer classes suitable for different age groups, making it convenient for parents to get their kids started on this crucial life skill. Scholarships may also be available to help make lessons affordable for all families.\nKnow Your Limits\nUnderstanding the swimming abilities of your children is crucial when selecting water environments. Whether it's a calm neighborhood pool or a more dynamic beach setting, choose locations that match the swimming proficiency of your kids.\nInexperienced swimmers may benefit more from controlled environments with lifeguards and clear safety guidelines.\nWater Safety Gear\nEquip your children with appropriate safety gear. For non-swimmers or those still building their skills, life jackets and floatation devices are essential.\nEnsure that the gear fits properly and is Coast Guard-approved. These tools not only provide an added layer of protection but also boost confidence, allowing kids to enjoy the water with a sense of security.\nEstablish and Enforce Pool Rules\nIf you have a pool at home or if your children visit family or friends with pools, establish and enforce a set of safety rules.\nMake sure your children understand the importance of following these rules, such as no running around the pool, no diving in shallow water and always entering the water feet first. Consistent reinforcement of these guidelines will create a safe and responsible pool environment.\nEmergency Preparedness\nLastly, be prepared for emergencies. Ensure that you and your children know basic water rescue skills, CPR and how to call for help in case of an emergency. Quick response time is often crucial in water-related incidents, and having the knowledge and ability to act promptly can be lifesaving.\nIn conclusion, as we celebrate National Water Safety Month, let's pledge to keep our families safe, happy and splashing responsibly.\nBy prioritizing supervision, investing in swim lessons, choosing appropriate environments, using safety gear, establishing and enforcing pool rules and being prepared for emergencies, parents can ensure that their kids develop a love for water activities while staying safe in the process. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event raises money for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their motto is \"We ride for those who died.\"\nAnyone on any level of law enforcement can make the ride. Although Denton is a nice spot in the middle of their ride, there were no law enforcement officers from Caroline County in the ride.\n\"The Denton Fire Chief and Town Manager have all been great to us, opening doors. The vo-tech kids cooked lunch for us. The Culinary Center fed us,\" said Marlboro, New Jersey, Police Department Lt. Nicholas Szymanski.\n\"In 16 years, we have ridden through Denton every year. We had 650 on bicycles and another 150 or so on support. We started in Lewes, Delaware, and stopped just short of the bridge in Kent Island,\" Szymanski said.\nThese men and women have lots of visible support, not just from massive American flags hoisted between two fire truck ladders, but mini flag waving children who offer high fives along the way.\n\"We have chapter trucks and trailers that bring Gatorade, waters, snacks. We have a full mechanic's truck, ambulances and motor units. Believe it or not, we had the commissioner of Highway Patrol in California ride with us this year. We had about 50 motorcycles in our group alone. They will stop intersections for us. Once we start pedaling we don't stop,\" Szymanski said.\nTheir efforts have raised a lot of money over the years.\n\"Our chapter had 440 riders, and we raised over $400,000. We raised over $2 million overall. It is for fallen police officers. Our responsibility it to make sure that the names of the former police officers aren't forgotten,\" Szymanski said.\nAll the money goes to the National Law Enforcement Museum and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n\"All the names of the fallen officers are enshrined on (the memorial). There are 25,000 names on there at least. We did an expansion last year for more stones to have room for more names. We add five or 10 names to that wall every year,\" Szymanski said.\nThe names are important. But supporting the families who have lost loved ones is essential, he said.\n\"The most important of it — the reason we do this is we bring survivors along with us. That is somebody's family member that was killed in the line of duty. We have their wives, their kids, their family members, fathers, mothers ride with us. We had 50 survivors ride with us this year,\" he said.\nWhat started with 18 riders in 1997 has grown exponentially. Since then, the Unity Tour has raised $35 million.\nTo learn more, go to policeunitytourchapterten.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There has never been anything like it in women's basketball when an individual player has drawn so much interest from fans wanting to see her play.\n\"Nobody's ever had a player like this. She's a combination of Pete Maravich and Steph Curry,\" said Fox announcer Gus Johnson. \"She plays in a different dimension and realm. Her ability to see, understand and anticipate the game and then from a physical aspect shoot the ball from almost anywhere when she gets into the frontcourt. Not even Diana Taurasi had this kind of range.\"\nSchools that have hosted Iowa have seen an attendance increase over 150% compared to their other home games on average. Northwestern had the first sellout in school history on Wednesday night when Clark and Iowa came to visit.\nAccording to ticket marketplace Vivid Seats, the top five most in-demand NCAA women's games this year have featured Iowa. The average price of tickets for the Hawkeyes since Clark joined the team in 2020 is up 224% and the average distance traveled by a fan to watch Iowa play is up 34% from last season.\n\"It's honestly, hard for me to wrap my head around. It's crazy, it's crazy the way people scream my name and really support us and I try to make time for as many as them as I can,\" Clark said. \"Like whenever I walk off the court, it's so special just the way people scream our names and are so excited for our team. And that's something that never gets old. I was that kid a few years back, so it's crazy how time flies and I just try to soak it all in, every single moment.\"\nIt's not just kids who want to see Clark and her deep 3's in action.\nFormer Iowa high school teammates Susan Johnstad, Deb Littlefield and Stephanie Fournier met at the Iowa-Rutgers game on Jan. 5 in Piscataway, New Jersey. They played basketball and softball together at Roland Story High School, about 45 miles from where Clark grew up in Des Moines.\n\"It's been 30 years since we've all been together,\" said Johnstad, who suggested they travel from their current homes in Virginia, Massachusetts and Iowa to watch Clark. \"We played six-on-six basketball, and Iowa has such a tradition of supporting women's basketball. Clark's skill set is just amazing. In her recent commercial for Gatorade, she said she dreams big — and it shows.\"\nJohnstad says she's proud to see the joy last year's AP player of the year brings to fans wearing her No. 22 jersey, young and old.\n\"I'm a fan girl, for sure,\" said Johnstad, who is an administrator at Virginia Tech. \"I can see her play on television. But (it's fun) to be able to see the people lined up beforehand and the girls working on their signs and doing the face paints.\"\nClark is part of a new generation of stars that fans can easily and constantly see, through highlights on social media and games available on a whole host of networks and streaming services.\nBack when Candace Parker, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Sheryl Swoopes were dominating the game it was harder to see them play. Twitter and Instagram weren't around — YouTube was launched in 2005 — and players weren't allowed to star in national commercial campaigns like Clark is doing with State Farm and Nike.\nLast year's national championship game that featured Iowa and LSU drew almost 10 million viewers. This year, the Hawkeyes have already had games on NBC, Fox and ESPN. The overtime loss to Ohio State on NBC averaged 1.93 million viewers across the network and Peacock, peaking at 3.9 million during overtime. Over a million fans tuned in for Iowa's win over Indiana on Fox.\nAlso in that crowd for the game at Rutgers was New Jersey Devils President Jake Reynolds. With him were his three daughters, Makenzie, 13, Katelyn, 10, and Harper, 8.\n\"This is something we decided to go to. Not a Rutgers season ticket holder, but this was part of the Caitlin Clark phenomenon,\" he said. \"It was something that I sat there in amazement, just looking at the energy of what was going on around this event. Then I was blown away by just the response from so many fans. And then I was really proud to see so many young girls there.\"\nReynolds said watching Clark play in person has had a lasting effect on his daughters.\n\"To be able to, one, just witness the phenomenon that it is,\" he said. \"To be able to give my girls the opportunity and the experience to see that firsthand, someone that inspires them and someone that they aspire to be like, to be able to give them that experience and be able to share that experience with them is something that here we are several weeks later and it is still something that is talked about in our house.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The community gathered over several days to celebrate.Many Black residents of the town and NAACP members marked the occasion by observing Voting Rights Day on Sept. 26, participating in Unity Day activities on Sept. 28, and appreciating the new signage placed at the entrance to the primarily Black residential community of Brooklyn in Federalsburg.\n\"Federalsburg was hosting. The town was the organizer of the event. It is the first anniversary,\" Willie G. Woods, president of the NAACP Caroline County Branch, said. \"We were there to support what was happening in Federalsburg. They had a cross section of vendors and participants and music and food.\"\nWoods said it is important to stand up and be heard.\n\"You have to come together and share your ideas, your viewpoints and your respective cultures. And you have to respect the contributions that the diverse population is making,\" she said.\nBrandy James, a Federalsburg Town Council member elected in last year's historic election, said the event was a success and that there was a good crowd.\n\"It symbolized unity to me. We had people from every aspect of Federalsburg. The faith-based community was there. Law enforcement was there. Not just Federalsburg police, but also the Caroline County Sheriff was there,\" said James.\nShe said there were many vendors there, including the Caroline County Health Department and smoking cessation resources.\n\"The NAACP has a table, Men For Change, there were churches with tables out there. They were giving away free cotton candy, and the kids had a blast. It was a great way to see everyone from across the lifespan come together and celebrate the unity of Federalsburg,\" James said.\nShe said the actual business of sitting on the council is slower than she would like, but she said everyone is being fairly heard.\n\"I am hopeful to see more African American people run for office in the future, and I am hopeful that the town business will get a little more streamlined and more organized,\" she said.\nThe Sept. 26 celebration and plaque were requirements of a settlement in a 2023 lawsuit brought against the town in federal court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nThe sign that was placed at Brooklyn said, in part, \"In coordination with the Mayor and the Council of Federalsburg, created an opportunity for Federalsburg's Black community to elect two representatives to the Federalsburg Town Council. Through their efforts, with support of the ACLU of Maryland and the guidance from the United States District Court, the town adopted and implemented a new and fair election system, undoing the 200 year exclusion of Black residents from town government. Federalsburg's historic election on September 26, 2023 resulted in two Black women winning seats to the town council: Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James. This day forever marks a turning point in Federalsburg's diverse community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Ward 4 candidates talk property taxes, housing\n\n April 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Candidates for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council have offered varying opinions on the town's property tax rate.Incumbent the Rev. Elmer Davis, Moonyene Jackson-Amis and Cameron Keefe are squaring off in the town's election May 6. Each discussed their views on property taxes, housing and more in interviews with The Star Democrat's editorial board last week.\nCurrently, the town levies a tax on real property at 52 cents per $100 of assessed value. That mark hasn't changed since 2008. It's higher than Talbot County's other towns, but relatively low compared to Eastern Shore towns such as Cambridge, Denton and Salisbury.\nProperty values, though, have increased significantly in recent years. The state's 2025 reassessments showed the value of Group 1 residential and commercial properties in Talbot County increased by 22.1% from 2022. The town's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget projects $13.6 million in real property tax revenue, slightly up from last year. It was a tight and \"lean\" budget, Mayor Megan Cook has said.\nDavis, who's been on the council since 2020, said the property tax rate should be increased.\n\"I think the mayor's playing around a little bit. … They're not fiscally responsible,\" Davis said. \"We have not raised taxes, and here's the problem. We got that COVID money. We've been living high on the hog, and now we have to pay the piper.\"\nJackson-Amis, Ward 4's representative from 2001 to 2008, says the Town Council should have conversations with professionals about potential tax breaks.\n\"I think the property tax is a little steep,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"It seems like the idea is to get, to have a money funnel. A funnel as opposed to exacting what's necessary to support the budget.\"\nKeefe in his interview emphasized fiscal responsibility, while adding he understands new initiatives cost money.\n\"They make a lot of decisions that don't affect their wealth, but it affects everybody else's wealth,\" Keefe said of the council. \" ... We need to dismantle this ivory tower thing.\"\nHOUSING\nThe Ward 4 hopefuls each touched on plans to improve Easton's affordable housing stock. Keefe said \"we need to make Easton not just survivable, but livable.\"\n\"We can say all the buzz words we want, but I would love to see specifically starter homes in Easton, things that draw young families here,\" Keefe said.\nHe said he hopes to sit down with town planners to discuss their proposed inclusionary zoning ordinance that would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable.\nJackson-Amis says she's \"all for inclusionary zoning.\" She hopes to revisit the requirement that developers include 25% low or middle-income units in projects, an effort she supported in her prior stint on the council.\n\"If you're getting a benefit from the town, we need to be able to exact a benefit from you,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"If you're creating housing, we ought to know what our housing needs are, and that it shouldn't just be for the financial gain of wealthy people.\"\nDavis said he's \"not 100% sure\" current housing legislation in the works will answer all of Easton's housing needs. He advocated for the town to buy a piece of land and work with nonprofits.\n\"The town should buy a piece of land,\" Davis said. \"And the town should partner with Habitat (for Humanity) or some other organization to … ensure that we deal holistically with the person and the property.\"\nEXPERIENCE\nThe Ward 4 candidates bring different experience levels to the table.\nDavis, 58, said he focused on constituent representation during his time on the council, such as when he supported a seafood odor ordinance last year.\n\"I'm in the position as the council member because of the people,\" he said. \"I represent those individuals in my ward. I'm not the end-all, be-all. So if my constituents say that this is what they want, then I represent them well.\"\nJackson-Amis, 77, said \"we should look toward wisdom.\"\n\"Right now you need people with some seasoned ability to ferret out issues and help bring solutions to problems,\" she said. \"So I don't think age really should be that important, but I think the experience is what should matter.\"\nKeefe, 25, said he wants more youth involvement in the town.\n\"I know I'm young. That is by no means any reason to take this lightly,\" Keefe said. \"I think this is important. I think there's a lot of potential for good that can happen from this. And above all of those things, I want to be a representative who listens.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will impact town spending, how development takes place and whether we can work together to plan and achieve shared goals.\nWhile I don't doubt all the candidates are devoted to their families, kind to their neighbors, happy to live in Easton, and aware of the issues, we should all expect a great deal more from public servants.\nOnly one candidate, Moonyene Jackson-Amis — running to represent Ward 4 on the council — was truly impressive to me. This highly educated woman — a practicing attorney, compassionate activist and experienced local public servant — spoke in specifics, rather than generalities. It was clear that she understands the needs of the residents of Ward 4 and the town at large.\nShe talked about practical ways to help wage-earners qualify for licensing in their various trades by incentivizing contractors to take advantage of their skills, thereby facilitating their advancement. She called for a study on repurposing the current hospital as a regional medical center for military veterans. She advocated for updates to a program she initiated during her prior term on the council so that residents can afford to stay in their homes. She suggested a new tourist attraction that would make use of an unused existing building. And she had other practical ideas as well. It's clear she has a well-thought-out action plan ready to go if she's elected.\nWhat's more, Moonyene obviously knows how to leverage all the elements needed to bring plans to fruition. That is the essential asset drawn from her knowledge of the law and wealth of experience, an asset that others appear to lack. She wants to serve constituents, not herself.\nI believe our Town Council will be a stronger, more effective body if Moonyene is elected. I hope everyone in Ward 4 already has a plan to be at our fire station on May 6 to vote for Ms. Jackson-Amis.\nWENDY ROTH\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In some ways, that fiscal pressure has increased since.Michael Sanderson, the executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties, briefed the Talbot County Council on those financial troubles and more during a special meeting Tuesday.\nHe told council members a budget shortfall of potentially $600 to $800 million could be facing lawmakers in Annapolis. Fixing that is \"not easy, but not impossible,\" he said.\n\"There are a couple of years of that in our forecast, and then it gets really serious,\" Sanderson said.\nWhen fiscal year 2028 arrives, Sanderson warned that the state will run out of money in its trust fund that's been used for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive and optimistic education initiative.\nMany counties have been under significant financial pressure due to state requirements stemming from Blueprint. Sanderson says the state will be feeling that level of pressure soon.\n\"The counties are feeling it now,\" he said. \"The state doesn't really feel it for a couple years down the road, and that has been a meaningful disconnect.\"\nWithout significant timeline adjustments for Blueprint from the state, MACo feels there will continue to be that disconnect between the fiscal situation of the state versus the situation counties are facing. State funding for transportation, though, is already causing serious impacts, Sanderson said.\n\"The canary in the coal mine that's already chirping is in transportation,\" he told the council members. \" … The conversation in the summer time is sometimes ambiguous and hazy and that sort of thing. But this year, not so much. They were just saying, 'If there aren't already shovels in the ground, we can't afford the next thing.'\"\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has been forced to delay many statewide projects amid a significant budget deficit. Earlier this month, the department released a draft plan that showed $1.3 billion in cuts from the state's six-year transportation plan.\nSanderson noted the \"state's transportation challenge is not a function of the Key Bridge\" rebuild, which is set to begin next year.\nAt the county level, council Vice President Pete Lesher said Talbot County is \"finding itself in a slightly different place\" than others.\n\"We are going through a number of capital construction projects, our health department, our sheriff's office, our 911 center,\" Lesher said, emphasizing some of those projects are receiving \"pandemic-era related funds\" from the federal government.\n\"The pinch that a lot of counties are feeling right now, the income tax, is not yet being felt in Talbot County,\" Lesher said. \"We can look around at our neighbors and see what is coming, even though we are not yet in that position now.\"\nLesher thanked Sanderson and MACo President Johnny Olszewski Jr. for their work to represent the counties at the state level year-round.\n\"We know that we are stronger together in Annapolis,\" Lesher said. \"And we see every year what a powerful voice MACo is for all of us jointly.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was especially true on Sunday, when Casterella finished the Ironman 70.3 Eagleman in six and a half hours.The triathlon, held in Cambridge, consisted of a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a 13.1-mile run.\n\"I cried at the end. I was ecstatic. I couldn't hold my emotions in, and it truly just goes to show that with determination, consistency and resilience, you can do so much in any facet of life,\" Casterella said.\nThe 31-year-old was inspired to train for the Eagleman in 2024 after a yearlong battle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer most commonly found in older adults. Casterella said only 22,000 people a year get diagnosed with the disease, so it's important to create and spread awareness.\nWhen Casterella was diagnosed in October of 2023, his perspective on life changed.\n\"Your life flashes before you. You start thinking about your past, you start thinking about your present and then about your future,\" he said. \"And when younger people get diagnosed with a serious illness that is life or death, your future becomes so important, and you think about what you can accomplish and what you can possibly do before ending up in a coffin or six feet under. You start thinking about those things.\"\nWhile going through chemotherapy, Casterella found a community on social media.\n\"Social media was my outlet to find others who were going through disease and illness, but also attacking life while going through disease and illness,\" he said. Online, Casterella fostered relationships with people who he now considers mentors.\nSince going into remission, he uses social media to inspire others to \"attack life,\" even when facing adversity.\nCasterella said endurance sports are like going through a disease or illness. He had to endure a lot of things he didn't want to while going through treatment, but he saw it as a way to challenge himself mentally and physically, just like the triathlon.\n\"For me, coming out of this weekend, realizing that truly anything we set our minds to, dedicate, commit to, you can do anything. Don't just dream it. The things you wish you could do, just set goals will do it. I promise, it's never too late to start,\" he said.\nCasterella plans on racing in another Eagleman in the near future. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Family holding out hope for turf field project at Easton High\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The prospects of an artificial turf field at Easton High School are uncertain as the school year approaches.Jen Hawley's 18-year-old daughter, Elgin, has been a champion of the turf field. Elgin asked for it to be added to the school district's budget request last year as part of her wish with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nJen Hawley hoped to see the project take shape before Elgin left for college this summer. She asked Make-A-Wish to maintain its commitment to the project until July 31 before the nonprofit needed to begin working on a new wish for Elgin.\nTalbot County Public Schools received $1.5 million from the county meant to allocate towards outstanding capital projects this fiscal year, such as the turf field, which has an estimated price of $1.8 million.\nAt the end of July, Hawley said she was told the Board of Education is passing on partnering with Make-A-Wish for the turf field project.\n\"We're right back to where we started,\" Hawley said.\nIn mid-August of 2021, on the third day of field hockey tryouts, Elgin had an aneurysm on the field. It took almost two weeks after she collapsed before she began talking again, and it wasn't until February 2022 that she returned to school.\nElgin, who graduated this spring, hasn't been able to play field hockey since the aneurysm. When Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic granted her one wish, she asked for a turf field to be put in at Easton High.\nWith support from Make-A-Wish and a group of supporters known as \"Elgin's Army,\" the turf field was requested at a board meeting in July 2023 and later added to the budget by the board in December 2023.\nAt a Board of Education work session in June, President Emily Jackson said while she's a \"vocal proponent\" of the turf field project, she wasn't committed to allocating funds towards it this fiscal cycle.\n\"I am not necessarily saying, no, never let's not do it,\" Jackson said. \"But I'm saying that I think there are a lot of questions to be asked. Is turf the best option? Should we be going with really high-quality grass instead? What is going to cause the least number of injuries?\"\nThe board has not made an official decision allocating the $1.5 million. Capital projects that are vying for the funding, such as new auditorium lights at Easton High and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary, total to around $3.3 million.\nHawley believes if the district had acted sooner and actively partnered with Make-A-Wish, the $1.8 million estimate for the turf field could have been significantly lowered by donations, as well as a potential contribution from a turf field supplier.\n\"Having Make-A-Wish on our team … we could've gotten the field for much less,\" Hawley said.\nCounty Council Member Dave Stepp has been a proponent of the efforts of Elgin's Army and a potential turf field installation during the past year.\n\"Just from the overwhelming support of coaches and players who have shown up to express interest in how great that would be for our local athletes, I think that speaks for itself,\" Stepp said.\n\"I do know that they do have funds in reserve that they can make up the difference between the $1.5 (million) that we had given this fiscal year and the cost of the actual estimate,\" Stepp said regarding the Board of Education. \"So they can do that at any time they're ready to do so, and I'm optimistic that they will, and I hope so personally sooner than later.\"\nLesli Creedon, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic, said the organization is fully committed to providing Elgin another wish. Creedon said the average wish granted by Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic is around $10,000, and that the foundation was prepared to contribute around that mark toward a turf field installation.\n\"While I am disappointed that the BOE passed in the partnership with Make-A-Wish and do think (it's) shortsighted, I am hopeful that the county and its citizens will do more to support its young athletes and instill pride in our public schools,\" Elgin Hawley said in an emailed statement to The Star Democrat. \"And whatever they decide they continue to think of me and my story to move the field forward as a priority.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might also associate Jan. 6 with the political events of 2021.But Jan. 6 is actually the end of traditional 12 Days of Christmas celebrations.\nThe 12 days marks the birth of Jesus (Dec. 25) through the Coming of the Magi (the Three Wise Men).\nSome customs count the 12 days from sundown Dec. 25 until the morning of Jan. 6.\nEarly Christians celebrated Christmas on Jan. 6 until the Roman Empire moved the holiday to Dec. 25 in the 336 A.D. during the reign of Emperor Constantine. The late December date took the place of pagan holidays celebrating Roman gods and the Winter Solstice.\nStill, Jan 6. continued to be celebrated as Christmas by Britons and other Europeans in the Julian calendar.\nThe changeover to the Gregorian calendar in 1582 moved Christmas to Dec. 25 and closer to the Winter Solstice.\nIt was adopted by the British and Irish in 1752 which helped bring the calendar change to the American colonies.\nOther European countries, including Russia and its Eastern European neighbors, did not switch over until the early 20th Century. Orthodox Christians still celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7.\nStill, Jan. 6 holds a place in Christmas celebrations for Armenians, the Irish as well as folks in Appalachia and some Christian believers such as the Amish and Mennonites.\nArmenians - who are among the earliest in the Christian faith - still celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6.\nIn Ireland, the Jan. 6 celebrations have included women getting together for their own holiday festivities and the men of their households handling the cooking, cleaning and other chores for a day.\nIn Appalachia, Old Christmas still has a place for some with traditions such as getting together with family and friends, putting candles in windows and holiday food such as versions of fruitcakes (including apple stack cake), mincemeat pies and Christmas hams and serenading friends and neighbors.\nThere are also Appalachian superstitions that animals can speak at midnight on Old Christmas Day Jan. 6.\nThat superstition is on top Appalachians' holiday traditions such as eating ham hocks, black-eyed peas and greens on New Year's Day for good luck.\nThe Amish and Mennonites also celebrate Old Christmas with cakes, pies and other holiday foods as well as religious services. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/JENS MEYER\n\n Old Christmas is celebrated Jan. 6 in Appalachia and by the Amish, Mennonites, some Irish and other Christians. The birth of Jesus Christ was originally celebrated on Jan. 6 by many Europeans in the Julian calendar before being changed to Dec. 25. Jan. 6 is also the end of the 12 Days of Christmas, according to various customs.\n\n AP PHOTO/CZAREK SOKOLOWSKI\n\n Christmas was long celebrated on Jan. 6 in Great Britain, Ireland and other part of Europe until the changeover from the Julian to Gregorian calendars. Armenians still celebrate the birth of Jesus on Jan. 6 and Old Christmas is still commemorated in Appalachia and by the Amish and Mennonites. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board decided to push the decision back to the August meeting.\nMultiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over the Double Hills Road site.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school.\nReason included the use for indoor and outdoor activities and the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces… There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. It's got a large gym.\"\nWith the North Caroline High location, development prices will be about $500,000 cheaper. The site development for the North Caroline High location will be $10 million, while Double Hills Road would cost $10.5 million.\nAlthough in the community meetings multiple builds were shown, the new middle school, regardless of the location, will be a two-story building with a two-wing design.\nAccording to the Ed Specs Committee Powerpoint, the new anticipated project budget would be $103.82 million with state funding coming in at around $80 million and local funding covering the remainder.\nThe only concerns brought up about the North Caroline High site were the solar array on the property and the traffic Central Avenue could receive from a new school being added to the location.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nThe Board of Education will take all the information received and make a decision on what location will be picked at its August meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On your right, South opens one heart, you pass (I assume!), North responds one notrump (forcing or nonforcing, it doesnâ€™t matter), partner doubles (a takeout double of hearts), and righty rebids two hearts.What would you do?This problem faced four players at Bridge Base Online. You might pass, but that seems a tad cautious.Once you decide to do something, which suit would you prefer to be trumps: hearts or clubs?It seems clear to me that the answer is hearts. You cannot even guarantee an eight-card club fit, and you would have to win nine tricks. If so, surely you can take six or seven tricks in a heart contract for plus 200 or 500. Note the vulnerability.All four BBO players advanced with three clubs.Nine other Wests saw South open two hearts and East double in fourth position.Everyone ran to three clubs (using Lebensohl to warn of a weak hand).Now look at the full deal.How do two hearts and three clubs fareftIf the defenders are careful against two hearts doubled, they can take one spade, two hearts, two diamonds, one club and a diamond ruff for down two, plus 500.However, it isnâ€™t so straightforward. The play might well begin diamond, diamond, diamond ruff, a club to the king and another diamond. Then, though, South discards his spade loser and escapes for down one. East must shift swiftly to a spade, which is not obvious.Still, plus 200 would have been a cold top! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is definitely at the top of the list for a rookie of the year award.\nIf there was any fear of a drop-off with new leadership, Kilmon put those fears to rest and set a high bar for success in coming years.\n\"We know we broke every record we've ever broken,\" Kilmon said on Monday.\n\"We had the highest attendance ever,\" Kilmon said. \"It's hard for us to gauge because not everyone buys a ticket. But we do know that every parking space was full and every bus had about 45 minutes to an hourlong wait, and we had to add three buses on Saturday to accommodate the people.\"\nKilmon got a helping hand from Mother Nature who blessed the weekend with lovely weather and temperatures approaching 80 degrees under sunny skies for several of the days.\nThe executive director said multiple vendors — many of whom are already asking about next year — sold out or had record days at the festival.\nIf you have a 2025 calendar already, mark the weekend of Nov. 14-16 for the 54th Waterfowl Festival. We have no doubt that Kilmon will improve upon the tremendous success of this year's festival.\nThe success of the Waterfowl Festival is a success for the town of Easton and Talbot County too.\nDowntown Easton shops were packed all three days of the festival, and restaurants had waiting lists for tables.\nKilmon called the relationship between the festival and local businesses \"incredibly important.\"\n\"We're symbiotic,\" she said. \"So if they succeed, we succeed and vice versa.\"\nThe three-day festival has an economic impact of more than $3 million each year, Kilmon said. It benefits hotels, restaurants, retailers and even local nonprofits.\n\"It's typically one of the biggest fundraising events of the year because a lot of the food vendors and people involved in the festival, they are nonprofits,\" Kilmon said. \"And they're allowed to keep their proceeds, so it's extremely important to a lot of people.\"\nAt a breakfast Friday morning, Talbot County Economic Development and Tourism Director Cassadra Vanhooser extolled the virtues of the business community that makes the \"wonderful things\" that happen in the county possible.\n\"It's that private investment along with the public investment that builds the community,\" she said. \"And it's the festivals like the Waterfowl Festival — the granddaddy of them all — that weaves that fabric of the quality of life that we all love so much.\"\nThe festival may have just celebrated its 53rd anniversary, but it continues to grow and evolve.\nThroughout the festival venues music filled the air and complemented the many duck and geese calls typical of the festival. Overall there were 38 musical acts on multiple stages.\n\"That made the festival have a different vibe this year, I think,\" Kilmon said, \"just made it more of a friendly family party on every corner.\"\nFeedback has been \"incredibly positive,\" and Kilmon is excited to begin work on continuing Easton's Waterfowl tradition.\n\"Fifty-three years of our community coming together just gets better every year,\" Kilmon said. \"And we're already working on next year, believe it or not.\"\nIt is good that Kilmon and her team are already working on the 2025 show. This year's show will be tough to top. We have no doubt they will rise to the challenge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County considering new cannabis legislation\n\n July 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 523\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County is reviewing regulations on cannabis operations, but drafted legislation drew concerns from prospective business owners at a recent meeting.As drafted, legislation would bar cannabis growing and processing operations from locating within 500 feet of residential properties. That mark could be reduced for a specific project only if all property owners within that radius agree.\nAt a County Council meeting on July 8, a public hearing on the legislation was opened, during which two state license holders raised concerns. Discussion centered on changing the 500-foot setback to 200 feet.\nDave Ferraris, winner of a cannabis-processing license from the Maryland Cannabis Administration, which are awarded via a lottery, said the proposed restrictions would be \"detrimental.\"\n\"It's not the wild west,\" Ferraris said of cannabis operations. \"It's agriculture with oversight.\"\nEaston resident Lori Yates received a license for cultivation. She said on July 8 that passage of the county legislation would hinder her progress toward acquiring a property in Cordova, the now-closed Triple Creek Winery.\n\"It really would pull the rug out from us trying to work with the current owners,\" Yates said.\nOn the prospect of a 200-foot setback, Yates said she feels it would still allow for proper space \"to have it off of the public access road.\"\nBrennan Tarleton, the county's planning and zoning director, noted that in the original draft legislation, there's already a written-in opportunity to reduce the setback to 200 feet if the affected property owners agree. But he said moving the starting point down from 500 feet is a possibility.\n\"Two hundred feet isn't a pie-in-the-sky idea for a setback,\" Tarleton said.\nIf passed, the legislation would require processors and growers to obtain site plan approval from the county and operate on a lot of at least 20 acres. Additionally, operators must procure professional testimony that cannabis odor is not \"detectible from adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nFerraris voiced opposition to the \"no odors\" regulation, citing it is too extreme of a rule.\n\"Talbot County will realistically and effectively be disqualified from participating in cannabis processing and growing endeavors,\" Ferraris said.\nHe added that prospective cannabis operators aren't looking to exploit the county. \"We're not asking for a blank check. We're just asking for a fair chance,\" he said.\nTarleton noted the county mostly mirrored Easton's cannabis ordinance in regard to the odor requirement. He said Easton restricted to just indoor growing operations, though. Tarleton said council could consider exempting open-air growing operations from the \"no odors\" rule.\nTalbot's draft cannabis legislation also lays out standards for cannabis dispensaries to follow, largely falling in line with the state's recent legislation effective in July, 2024.\nDispensaries cannot be located within 500 feet of schools, child care centers, playgrounds, recreation centers, libraries, public parks or places of worship. They also can't locate within 1,000 feet of one another; that standard is present in Easton town limits, too, and in one case created competition between businesses.\nWhile Talbot County's potential regulations stick with the state, local jurisdictions are permitted under state law to change those distance requirements.\nThe county's cannabis legislation wasn't eligible for a vote on July 8. It may return to the council at its July 22 meeting or later in August. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "New exhibition at AAM features artist Darlene R. Taylor\n\n April 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 613\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A new art exhibition from multidisciplinary artist Darlene R. Taylor has debuted at the Academy Art Museum in Easton.The HEIRLOOMS exhibition runs through July 14.\nTaylor is an artist who is based in Washington D.C. and the Eastern Shore.\n\"In HEIRLOOMS, Darlene R. Taylor (b. 1960) affirms the resonance of memory in material culture as she imagines portraits of Black women obscured in historical archives. History is a muse that guides Taylor to know the past from the women who lived it. HEIRLOOMS examines the presence of Black women in Maryland's Talbot County communities and Taylor's own ancestry and follows the artist's experience researching and interpreting photographs found in archives and family albums. Taylor employs mixed-media collage using vintage linens, laces, cottons, and buttons collected and handed down from mother to daughter, friend to friend,\" according to an announcement from the museum.\n\"I've been using antique textiles for some time, many of which I found in antique stores locally in Maryland. But the works in HEIRLOOMS have an even more resonant history. I had been thinking about the way the handkerchief holds so many emotions and experiences—sweat and tears, joy and sadness. When I shared that thought with my friend circle, they responded by giving me handkerchiefs and linens passed down through their own families. In this way, my work is becoming its own archive of Black women's lives. The cloth holds memory, and when it is given to me, I am connected to an ancestor through that exchange,\" Taylor said.\nAccording to AAM:\n\"Her use of women's personal effects also draws inspiration in part from artifacts unearthed during two excavations commissioned by the Museum at the former home of Henny and James Freeman, one of the earliest- documented free Black landowning families who lived on the Hill Community site from 1787-1828. This site was gifted to AAM in 2023, and the Museum has plans to rehabilitate the existing structure on the site and connect it to new construction of an annex that will provide needed administrative space, as well as commemorate the historical significance of Easton's Hill Community. Part of the annex will be named The Henny and James Freeman Wing and showcase the objects unearthed from the excavations in outdoor displays that tell the story of the family and neighborhood. Of the more than 6,000 historical artifacts unearthed, the most remarkable finds were personal items including buttons, jewelry, children's toys, a woman's shoe buckle, and a hair comb. These unique objects offer a rare connection to Black domestic life in the eighteenth century— particularly the lives of Black women and children, whose stories were frequently lost to history.\"\n\"In trying to imagine these lives, I am always asking what is behind each woman's gaze. Much of my work is based on photographs of women I find in historic archives. Even though we can see their faces, we often know more about the objects pictured in the room than we do about the women. So I try to stand with each woman, to look at what she is looking at. I'm not staring at her; I'm seeing the world as she sees it and observing those elements that make up her world,\" said Taylor.\nA handmade paperback book HEIRLOOMS is available for purchase in AAM's Museum Shop as well as a limited-edition fine art print of the image The Storyteller with an excerpt of the poem Porch Telling written by Darlene R. Taylor.\n\"Taylor's HEIRLOOMS stitches together the forgotten stories of Black women, weaving memory and material into a vibrant tapestry of resilience and remembrance. We are thrilled to showcase Taylor's beautiful works on paper and to amplify voices that have historically been silenced,\" said. interim director Jennifer Chrzanowski. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Occasionally, the bidding will tell you -- as here. North's double of three clubs was for penalty, not takeout, as it would be today.This old deal features a truly incredible defense -- one of the most imaginative ever. The deal was reported by Frenchman Jacques Blaizot, who was sitting West. He was in the Palace of Da Lat, partnering Bao Dai, then the Emperor of French Indochina. (Later, the palace was in South Vietnam.)Defending against three no-trump, West led the club ace. How do you think the defense went?West opened with a cautious three clubs. North doubled for penalties, but South, with his distributional hand, wisely didn't pass. (Three clubs was unbeatable.) Then, when North bid three hearts, South thought he was facing a heart-club two-suiter. So, rather than look for a nonexistent spade fit, he settled for three no-trump.This is how Blaizot reported the play: \"I led the club ace and under the eyes of the panic-stricken spectators, Bao Dai discarded the diamond ace! I continued with the club queen and he discarded the spade ace! Immediately, silence filled the room. Discreetly, the spectators, struck with fright, got up and whispered into each other's ears. Then, little by little, a disquieting rumor spread through the palace: 'The emperor has gone mad. He threw away all of his aces.' But no! Bao Dai wasn't playing to lose.\"If the emperor had kept either of his aces, South could have established that suit without letting West on play. Now, though, West had to win a spade or diamond trick and could cash enough club winners to defeat the contract.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was on his way to his construction job, his family said. He was taken to ICE's field office in Salisbury and then transferred to Baltimore, where he spent three nights in Baltimore before being transferred to a detention center in Louisiana.\nEspinal was granted bond on Tuesday, family told The Baltimore Banner.\nHis arrest received regional and national attention. In Easton, it stopped services at his congregation and sparked weekly protests against ICE.\nEarlier this month, Easton Town Council members called for Espinal to be returned to his family.\nEspinal has been in the country since 2001 and has no criminal record, his family has said. Following his arrest, ICE stated that Espinal was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement said. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years.

Malkus led the Maryland opposition to defeat Maryland's 1962 Civil Rights bill, as proposed in the federal Civil Rights bill created to outlaw racial discrimination. This was the primary legislation outlining today's law of the land. When Malkus and a few other segregationists failed, he led the group to try to exempt individual counties from state legislation. Again, that failed, but in return, Malkus then tried to exempt bars from the accommodations portion of the bill.All of his various efforts to dilute the national and state civil rights bills failed, and the landmark national bill passed with the Maryland legislature complying.He publicly decried civil rights legislation of any kind as being \"un-American.\"He proposed a bill to provide criminal penalties for anyone claiming discrimination.He proposed a bill that would make it a crime to make false statements about a community — another unconstitutional act. He continually blamed the media and \"outsiders\" for all of Cambridge's troubles, without helping to correct its real economic and racial problems.He voted against the repeal of a state law forbidding interracial marriage.On national TV, he said Martin Luther King was a \"communist troublemaker\" and Gloria Richardson was a \"media-hungry agitator.\"He publicly supported Gov. George Wallace's bid for president in 1964.At a Goucher College televised conference with Gov. Wallace, he said, \"Cambridge's Nonviolent Action Committee employed the same tactics as Hitler.\"He sent a letter to President John Kennedy complaining that his attack by three black boys in Baltimore was not given as much news coverage as the shooting of Medgar Evers. This is the only letter on record to either President Kennedy or Attorney General Robert Kennedy addressing the issue of racial problems in Cambridge with an attempt to calm the issue – an odd letter for a state senator (of the same party), who never asked for federal assistance.\nCorrection: Gov. Hughes did not veto the building of the bridge – he vetoed naming the bridge after Sen. Malkus. The governor said: \"It didn't seem right for the bridge to be named after the state's staunchest segregationist.\"\nPATRICK HORNBERGER\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Galena passes budget while starting first time investment\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 622\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GALENA — After a public hearing for the budget where no members of the public attended, Mayor John Carroll and the Galena Town Council on Monday night passed the ordinance to their fiscal year 2025 budget.The total allocations divided between fund categories: General, $553,250; Sewer, $342,246; and Water, $173,675 — for a combined total of $1,069,171 matched their total income for a balanced budget.\nThe town budget includes a tax revenue of $258,000, alongside $76,678 in receivables for utilities.\nThe property tax rate, Carroll said, remains set at .0222 per $100 of assessed value. There was no increase in taxes, no increase for additional fees, water or in trash and recycling.\nTown Attorney Tom Yeager reminded the council they were passing the ordinance to pass the budget.\nUltimately, they approved of ordinance 2024-01FY-25 Budget.\nAlso during this budget session, the town embarked for the first time in investing. They decided to take some money out of their savings and place it in an interest bearing certificate of deposit account.\nFinancial and Administrative Clerk Marisa Pisapia, while bringing up various line items, got the attention of the council about this. Once they scoured places to invest they chose to secure their investment with PNC Bank for eight months at a 4.65% interest rate.\nCouncil member Sarah Merrell made it official.\n\"I make a motion to authorize doing a CD out of our water savings account,\" she said.\nThe motion passed unanimously.\nCarroll detailed the next step in the process. Right before they leave for the Maryland Municipal League June 23 — 26 in Ocean City, they'll meet with someone from PNC Bank. From there they'll set up an account to get things in motion.\nAs a first, reiterated Carroll, \"we're dipping our toes in it.\"\nIn other financial matters, Grants Coordinator and Tech Support Grant Audrey Erschen talked about the various grants she's been working on.\nShe received notification their Teen Play Area was included in the State of Maryland's FY2025 Budget, and must be approved by the Maryland Board of Public Works. The grant was for climbing equipment and installation.\nThey were not awarded this year on their No Gym, Think Outside Application, but she'll try again next year.\nAnd in the tech department, she was informed they would not have to replace their Quick Books until 2026 — a relief for the council.\nMaintenance and Facilities Coordinator Warren Walters had updates of his own particularly concerning the wastewater treatment plant. They had removed 42.55 tons of sludge in 2024, with a total cost of $2,957.24. Total effluent gallons (liquid waste or sewage discharged) discharged were 3,873,000 and daily average effluent gallons were 25,463.\nCarroll who wanted to get a general idea, said, \"It looks like we're averaging 25,000 gallons or so. That's what I wanted to see, where we're truly at. I want to know what our capacity is always. And when it fluctuates during a certain point of time.\"\nWalters, working with Erschen, said his goal going ahead is in mitigation procedures, aiming to reduce the production of methane and leachate that can contaminate surface waters. This process involves managing wastewater at its source, which can include water conservation and recycling.\nWalters is in conversations with the Environmental Protection Agency, so the town possibly won't have to spend money on the mitigation process. Carroll thought that a good idea, and mentioned that he's been talking with the University of Maryland Finance Center too. The idea is once they have their survey complete, they'll open up the conversation even more.\n\"We can attack it from both angles,\" Carroll said, \"state and federal.\"\nAfter hearing updates on all departments, Yeager commended the council on their work.\nCarroll noted the completion of the budget was a team effort.\nThe Galena Town Council's next meeting will be on Monday, July 1.

    "content": "Natural Resources Police use thermal imaging to rescue lost kayaker in Talbot County\n\n July 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 344\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BROAD CREEK — Police and firefighters teamed to locate a lost juvenile kayaker last weekend in Talbot County.On July 4 around 10 p.m., Maryland Natural Resources Police were informed of a lost kayaker in the Broad Creek area, which is on the west side of the county south of St. Michaels. Officials said he was on the water for \"several hours\" and around three miles from home.\nUsing thermal imaging cameras, a Natural Resource Police aviation unit quickly found the lost person — in around five minutes, according to Sgt. John Buchanan, chief pilot for NRP. Buchanan was in the aircraft with tactical flight officer Christian Helwig.\nBuchanan said the kayaker left out of Grace Creek.\n\"I think it got dark on him, and he didn't know where he was,\" Buchanan said.\nOnce located, police used a spotlight to direct a rescue boat from the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Company toward the juvenile.\nA video posted to Facebook by Natural Resource Police shows the aircraft hone in on the kayaker and direct the fire boat to retrieve the juvenile.\nBuchanan said such a rescue isn't too common, but it become somewhat prominent during boating season.\n\"(The) Chesapeake Bay and the tributaries are very large,\" Buchanan said. \"When you start thinking about the different rivers and creeks and stuff off the Chesapeake Bay, we go out on different search missions like that probably a few times a month.\"\nThe pilot emphasized Helwig's expertise is crucial to such rescues. Helwig handles the thermal imaging camera, which can expose subjects in dark conditions, as well as a mapping system to pull up addresses and latitudes and longitudes.\n\"He's gotten really good with it, he's worked really hard at it,\" Buchanan said. \"He's made us as a team very successful going out and doing these search missions.\"\nBuchanan advises those going out on the water, especially alone, to be prepared with a charged cell phone and other equipment in case of emergency.\n\"Have a life jacket if you're out at night,\" he said. \"Obviously have some kind of flashlight. And know the area, that's probably the biggest thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "QAC hears 5-year capital project preview\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — With a number of large projects on the horizon, the Queen Anne's County finance department provided a head-start to the budget process with an overview to the County Commissioners Nov. 26.Jeff Rank, director of budget and finance, presented data from a Capital Budget Work Session including a preview of major capital projects currently in the planning stages for the upcoming five years.\nDue to the fact that the county has more costly projects than usual, the finance department sought to present an early start to the review process, he said.\nThe total capital project expenditures programmed for the current year and planned for the next five years is about $285 million, according to Rank.\nGoing back 20 years, the average capital plan was about $31 million per year, which adjusted for inflation is about $35 million per year, he said.\n\"If we stick to this average which has been our current comfort zone this puts us at about $96 million above that threshold over the next five years, \" Rank said.\nUpcoming major projects include a new regional detention center in Church Hill at about $24.2 million, a potential Centerville Middle School replacement at $20.5 million, a $20 million recreation center, new sheriff facilities at $16 million, and historic courthouse renovations at $10 million, he said.\nProposed projects not yet programmed into the capital plan include Queen Anne's County Library expansion, new Board of Elections facility, and potential uses for the old Board of Education building.\nAlso presenting an overview of debt measures and debt management policy, Queen Anne's County has a cap of 10% for debt as a percentage of general fund expenditures, Rank said, noting over the next five to six years, the county is not expected to hit that cap.\nAnother county debt measure is debt as a percentage of real property assessable base, with a cap set at 2.5%. The county is only expected to hit a high of about 1.5% by the end of 2030, Rank said.\nThe other debt measure is per capital debt as related to per capita income. With a policy stating a maximum of 8%, the county is in compliance with 5% come 2030, he said.\nOver the past two years Queen Anne's County hasn't had any debt, but there is potential in the next three years, Rank said.\nCurrent debt measures are recommended by the Government finance Officers Association for counties nationwide, according to Rank, noting Maryland counties have burdens that most other counties in the country do not.\nMaryland counties are required to provide funding for local boards of education, pay for County Road systems to a higher proportion than most other counties in the country and Maryland also has high levels of service for public safety efforts in the county, he said.\nExcluding funding for the Board of Education, the county typically keeps annual cost increases very close to the annual inflation increases of three to four percent, Rank said.\nFor each year debt service increases at rates above inflation, cuts must be made to other county services including public safety, education, roads, and park maintenance, he said.\n\"It's when that happens we find it difficult to maintain our current levels of service with all the other things we have to pay for in the county,\" Rank said.\nThe Finance Department meets with the Board of Education quarterly to keep in better sync with their programming and projects, according to Rank.\nMoving forward the finance department recommends a smoother flatter debt burden from year to year rather than wild increases, he said.\nFor the upcoming capital budget schedule, departments have begun preparing budgets for next year's capital plan due Jan. 10.\nEarly to mid March will see finance meetings with County Administrator Todd Mohn who will submit the proposed budget to the commissioners March 25.\nBudget work sessions will be held at the end of March or early April and ideally the final budget will be adopted June 10.\nMany projects are dependent on state shared revenues and grants that the county can leverage additional dollars for, which will also be part of the decision making process going forward, Mohn said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Growing goodness — Sandy's Garden gives back to community\n\n April 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 584\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Sandy Zappia owner of Sandy's Garden donates her produce to the food pantries in Kent County, including the Maryland Food Bank.Fresh fruits and veggies are delivered to those in need, grown using no pesticides or herbicides with natural compost on 3.5 acres on Annie Crow Road. There, a small but dedicated operation of 20-25 volunteers build their organization aiming to make fresh and healthy food available each week.\nOn Saturday, a week before Easter, Zappia delivered a little bit of that joy to the farmers market on High Street, introducing the community to 25 of her baby chicks, the hardworking future egg providers for the community.\nAlthough it was a little cold out, the chicks weren't, warmed by heaters. The chicks greeted children, teens and adults who held and petted them — a friendly Chestertown welcome. Believe it or not, some have never held a baby chick, Zappia said.\nThe recent arrivals, coming from Murray McMurray hatchery are a rainbow assortment which will offer a variety of different colored eggs.\nZappia loved introducing her little feathered friends while teaching lessons on rural life.\n\"Today was exactly what I was hoping for, just spreading joy to people. What a great way to spend a Saturday.\"\nZappia encouraged people to add to their volunteer number as they prepare for summer planting season.\nFor Zappia, gardening is a passion, first discovered through her late husband while raising their three children on a West Virginian farm. When she moved back to Maryland to stay close to her immediate family, she put farming on hold, and had a fulfilling career as a preschool teacher at Friendship Montessori School.\nAfter her husband passed away, and her children were grown, going separate ways, that farming desire was restored. In Rock Hall, there were plans for a garden restaurant and for her to run the garden. Those plans fell through, and attempts for Zappia to purchase the garden did not take root.\nHowever, another opportunity arose, and she purchased 3.5 acres of cornfield, which would become the future home of her own operation.\n\"The idea for Sandy's Garden came about when the restaurant garden where I was working had more produce than we could use- so we donated it to the local food pantry. What an eye-opener! I had no idea of the need for fresh fruit and vegetables in the county. I realized at that moment that I wanted to help meet that need.\"\nSandy's Garden was established, and today there is a garden, a chicken coop to house her newest, adorable arrivals, a beehive to pollinate those plants and a greenhouse so they can grow crops year-round.\nAlthough they are not a 40-acre farm, they can grow a lot with what they have, Zappia exclaimed. With a goal to provide food to the pantry every week, with heart, hard work and dedication they have been doing just that.\nFor example, the date of the interview, April 18, they dropped off 38 pounds of spring crops, lettuce, spinach and kale. In May, they will add warmer weather crops, like tomatoes, green beans and peppers to the mix.\nZappia showed appreciation to all her volunteers, hoping for many others.\n\"I love to teach people but even if you want to just hang out with the chickens, you're welcome to do that too,\" Zappia said.\nSandy's Garden is a non-profit dedicated to nurturing our community by making sure everyone has access to wholesome food. Scope it out at at sandysgarden.org or 304-761-0286 or contact her at sandysgardeninc@gmail.com.\n'We are a happy little self-sustaining area,\" Zappia said, laughing. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "House GOP introduces bill to repeal Biden college plan\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration's plans to make college more affordable.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina), passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden's efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\" Foxx said, \"Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\"\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden's original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration's plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx's College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) praised parts of Foxx's bill, \"such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\" but the panel's ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning (D-Michigan) offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) offered a motion to remove the bill's rescission of Biden's SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\"The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration… creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\" Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Michigan) unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici's proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tables were set up in the gymnasium, where attendees could get information for health wellness; anything from house gutter protection to cochlear ear implant options.\n\"This expo is dedicated to fostering partnerships among local organizations that provide valuable services and education on essential health and wellness topics,\" said Gale Drenning president of HomePorts, a partner of the event.\nThis year, Acme Pharmacy provided flu and COVID vaccines.\nAt the next table over, the new Health Educator at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown, Sandy Wilson-Hypes demonstrated CPR practices on a mannequin, inviting guests to try it out.\nTeenager, Nate Perogoy was up for the challenge, exercising chest compressions to the tune \"Staying Alive,\" a perfect tempo at 100/120 compressions per minute.\nIn addition to the vendors, classes were provided.\nIn \"Unlock the Secrets of Ancient Nutrition,\" Bill Schindler author, internationally-known chef and founder of Eastern Shore Food Lab, instructed how to get the most nutrients from food and sustain your health amid a worldview of unhealthy practices.\nLt. Sean Maloney of the Kent County Sheriff's Office gave his presentation: \"Don't Be A Victim! The Latest Scams, Schemes, and Frauds.\" He said threats come from everywhere: computer hackers, romance scams, fake scanners at ATMs and stores, dumpster diving and mail.\nHe pointed out victims can be anybody, but especially retirees with disposable income.\nGloria Carter offered a dance-based cardio class, available Mondays and Wednesdays at the YMCA.\nThroughout the afternoon, while people went from table to table, they were treated to the musical talents of River Voices from Chester River Chorale directed by Stephanie LaMotte.\nOutside, under a blue sky and moderate weather, food was provided by Happy Chicken and Lockbriar Farms. Patrons enjoyed squash soup, pumpkin ice cream and fresh-pressed apple cider.\nThe expo was well-attended, with over 300 programs handed out, said a volunteer.\nThroughout the years the expo had many homes, but for the past three years the YMCA has been proud to host it.\nExecutive Director of the YMCA Erica Osterhout and her staff expressed excitement welcoming the expo each year. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Memories and recipes from grandparents\n\n September 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1276\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Grandparents Day is Sept. 7 this year. In 1978, the late Jimmy Carter, who was the president, designated the first Sunday after Labor Day each year to honor grandparents.What a wonderful day to honor those important people in our lives. My grandparents died many years ago, but the memories live on. Generations have changed; grandparents are younger (it seems), lifestyles are somewhat different, but we still have Mom-Mom and Pop-Pop.\nMy mother and I would sit and talk about days I spent with my paternal grandparents. They too had a large farm, and my older siblings and I would help with farm work.\nI recall thinking that the grandparents' farm duties were out-of-date compared to the \"modern\" equipment my dad used. Then my older brother's fourth generation farm down on the river was ultra-modern.\nMy grandparents were an important part of my life. My maternal grandmother died at age 18 when my mom was 2 years old, so I never had the pleasure of knowing this person who gave me the best mother ever. My paternal grandparents were dear to me as they were all I had.\nI have lots of stories to share with you all in the coming months. Stories of mischief and fun growing up with large families on large farms.\nFood seemed to be a very popular activity for grandparents when the grandchildren came. I have many great memories of special dishes such as fresh made biscuits, pies, dumplings, soups, stews, beans and fried chicken.\nCooking is a tradition that still happens today with my own grandsons.\nA few times a month, one of my grandchildren has spent the day with me. A few years ago, when we ran out of things to do, we started baking. This has been so much fun.\nNot only have we developed math skills, reading skills, and the ability to follow directions, but we have also developed an awesome relationship between generations.\nOur first bread to be made was banana bread.\nBANANA BREAD\n1/2 cup shortening, 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups flour, 1 tbsp sour milk, 1 tsp baking soda, 2 ripe crushed bananas, 1/2 cup crushed nuts (optional).\nCream shortening with eggs and sugar. Add flour, sour milk, baking soda, crushed bananas and nuts. Mix well and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for one hour. For best results, use a medium size baking pan.\nPUMPKIN BREAD\n2 2/3 cups sugar, 2/3 cup shortening, 4 beaten eggs, 2/3 cup water, 1 can pumpkin puree (1 lb), 3 1/3 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsps baking soda, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 2/3 cup chopped walnuts, 2/3 cup chopped dates.\nCream together sugar and shortening. Stir in eggs, water and pumpkin. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Mix well with the wet ingredients. Add walnuts and dates. Pour into two greased 9-by-5-inch pans. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour and 15 minutes.\nGRANDMA'S ROSEMARY DINNER ROLLS\n1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast, 1/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°), 3 cups bread flour, 2 tbsps sugar, 1 tbsp minced fresh rosemary, 3/4 tsp salt, 2/3 cup warm 2% milk (110° to 115°), 1 large egg (room temperature), 1/4 to 1/3 cup canola oil, 1 large egg yolk, 2 tbsps 2% milk.\nIn a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Place the flour, sugar, rosemary and salt in a food processor: pulse until blended. Add the warm milk, egg and yeast mixture; cover and pulse 10 times or until almost blended. While processing, gradually add oil just until dough pulls away from sides and begins to form a ball. Process 2 minutes longer to knead dough (dough will be very soft). Transfer dough to a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide and shape into 12 balls. Roll each into a 15-inch rope. Starting at one end, loosely wrap dough around itself to form a coil. Tuck end under; pinch to seal. Place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. For egg wash, in a small bowl, whisk egg yolk and milk; brush over rolls. Sprinkle it with remaining rosemary. Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, 18-22 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks; serve warm.\nEASTERN SHORE SWEET POTATO BISCUITS\n2 cups mashed sweet potatoes, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 1/4 cups flour, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsps baking powder, 5 tbsps shortening.\nMix sweet potatoes with sugar, flour, salt and baking powder. Add 5 tablespoons shortening last and mix dough. Roll dough and cut with biscuit cutter or roll into small balls 3/4 inch thick. Bake at 450 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes.\nFRIED CHICKEN\n1 frying chicken, salt, 1 1/2 cups flour, pepper, paprika, 1 1/2 cups shortening.\nWash chicken in cold water and cut into pieces. Soak in cold water for a few minutes with 1 tsp of salt. Drain chicken. Season flour with salt, pepper and paprika to taste. Heat shortening in a fry pan. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and place in the oil. Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 20 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. I usually mix my flour mixture in a brown paper bag and shake to coat. I also save the flour mixture to make a gravy in the grease when chicken is cooked.\nGRANDMOTHER'S SOUTHERN COLLARD GREENS\n2 tbsps lard or shortening (divided), 1 large onion (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (minced), 1 1/2 pounds smoked ham hocks, 6 cups water, wine, 2 tsps seasoned salt, 1 to 3 tsps crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp sugar, 1 large bunch collard greens (coarsely chopped).\nIn a six-quart stockpot, heat 1 tbsp lard over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender. Add ham hocks, water, seasoned salt, pepper flakes and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until meat is tender, 55 to 60 minutes. Add collard greens, wine, and remaining 1 tbsp lard. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until greens are very tender, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove meat from bones; finely chop and return to pan. Discard bones. Serve with a slotted spoon.\nGRANDMOTHERS CORN PUDDING\n4 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, 1 can (15 ounces) cream-style corn, 1/2 cup sugar, 5 slices day-old bread (crusts removed), 1 tbsp softened butter. In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add corn and sugar; mix well. Cut bread into half-inch cubes and place in a greased 9-inch square baking dish. Pour egg mixture over bread. Dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.\nGRANDMOTHER'S TANDY CAKE\n4 large eggs (room temperature), 2 cups sugar, 1 cup 2% milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 3/4 cups creamy peanut butter, 5 milk or dark chocolate candy bars (1.55 ounces each) chopped, 2 tbsps butter.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick and lemon colored. Beat in milk and vanilla. In another bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to egg mixture and mix well. Spread into a greased 15-by-10-inch baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack. Spread peanut butter over top; cool completely. In a double boiler or metal bowl over simmering water, melt chocolate and butter; stir until smooth. Gently spread over peanut butter. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland legislators kick off 447th General Assembly\n\n January 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 670\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — With snow piled up around the Statehouse, Maryland lawmakers returned to downtown Annapolis for the 447th General Assembly on Wednesday.More than 560 bills were prefiled in either the House of Delegates or Senate prior to the opening session. While both chambers began introducing bills Wednesday, the focus largely remained on the state's looming budget deficit that will be tackled in the coming weeks.\nThe state is predicted to face a $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Gov. Wes Moore (D), who some Republicans have criticized for his fiscal decisions, must submit his balanced budget proposal by next Wednesday.\nLeadership in the House and Senate acknowledged the deficit will be center stage but spoke optimistically about what's ahead.\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat from Baltimore County, said the House, which reviews the budget first, will \"use it to reflect our values.\"\n\"As we begin this session, I know there has been a lot of talk about our financial limitations. And there should be,\" Jones said. \"We can't deny our difficult fiscal reality. But instead of talking about what our budget can't do, I'd like to talk about what it can do. Most importantly, our budget has the power to protect the most vulnerable Marylanders.\"\nJones noted health care and transportation as areas that will continue to be prioritized, as well as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive education initiative.\n\"We don't want to talk about cuts and prioritizing programs, but we have to,\" Jones said. \"We don't want to talk about high-energy costs, but we have to. And we have to talk about protecting the investment we made for our students and teachers in The Blueprint.\"\nSenate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat beginning his sixth year in the role, said the General Assembly's efforts to fund and facilitate reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge last year showed the aptitude of Maryland's lawmakers.\n\"This institution showed exactly who it is,\" Ferguson said. \"Within days, we had put together legislation working with our House counterparts, with the governor, setting up the PORT Act in a bipartisan way to find ways to put resources immediately to use, to set the state up for success in the midst of crisis.\"\nFerguson said the budget deficit is the General Assembly's next significant challenge.\n\"I've been thinking about it a little bit differently recently, in that yes it is a challenge, but really, it's an opportunity for us in this body,\" Ferguson said. \" … What do we want our future to look like? How do we take this challenge and have the hard conversations about what do we prioritize to invest in people and to build communities in a way that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\nThe Senate president offered positivity through the fact that the state came in under budget and ahead of schedule on a significant project just outside of the Statehouse — the Maryland Department of Legislative Services building. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held tomorrow, he said.\n\"What emerged was everything that the state of Maryland should look like,\" Ferguson said of the new building that he called \"beautiful.\"\nLeadership in both chambers remained the same Wednesday. Ferguson and Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine, a Democrat from Prince George's County, were unanimously nominated to their positions.\nIn the House, Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein, a Baltimore County Democrat, was nominated and approved for a second consecutive year. Jones begins her sixth full term as speaker.\nOn Wednesday, the House Speaker reflected on the fact that her first job in public service was made possible by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, legislation the late President Jimmy Carter extended during his time in office.\n\"I know that we all love public service,\" Jones said. \"And when I think about public service, I think about the late President Jimmy Carter. As it turns out, I owe a lot to President Carter.\"\nJones said those are the ways in which \"government can do powerful things for regular people.\"\n\"Progress isn't linear, it's incremental,\" Jones said. \"It takes time. It takes resilience.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I've engaged in them all, and I value each for the lessons they teach. Losing, when it happens, can even make you stronger.In debate or sport, you must prepare. You must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and you must have a strategy. And win or lose, you are judged not only by the outcome but by how you carry yourself. I learned long ago: You lose with honor, but you win with grace.\nSo I ask — where has grace gone? Where has decorum gone? Today it seems acceptable to shout down opponents, to sneer and label, to point fingers instead of making points. These are tactics we would scold in children, yet they are now common currency in our politics.\nI always valued the end of a contest, when you could shake hands, smile and respect the person across from you — even if you didn't like them. The best opponent was never the one I agreed with, but the one I could respect.\nThe true test of character, in debate or in life, is simple: Would I welcome this person as my next-door neighbor? Increasingly, I fear too many of today's loudest voices would fail that test.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline superintendent projects 'good budget year,' discusses Blueprint\n\n December 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 617\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At last week's Caroline County Board of Education meeting, Superintendent Derek Simmons provided board members with a preview into the district's fiscal year 2026 outlook as budget season nears.Simmons said he and his team are in the process of developing a draft budget. What happens in this year's state legislative session is expected to impact how the budget looks, the superintendent said.\n\"We are really contingent upon what happens at the state level for our funding, and we do expect the General Assembly to be very engaged in things that could impact us budget-wise,\" Simmons said. \"So it is 100% likely we will not have a clear picture of our budget, of our revenue numbers until mid-April at best.\"\nAt the Dec. 3 meeting, Simmons reviewed the fiscal year 2025 budget, noting that around 60% of unrestricted funds were spent on salaries and wages. Those funds largely come from the state, as the district received around 66% of its FY25 revenue from the state in unrestricted money.\n\"When we talk about where our expenses come from, it's people,\" Simmons said. \"No surprise as we've said for years, we are a people business. It takes people to educate children. It takes people to make school work.\"\nContracted services accounted for just under 7% of the unrestricted budget. Board Member Troy Plutschak said he wants the board to find out how much auditing through outside companies costs.\nSimmons said the district is often audited, but that moving audits in-house would be difficult and put the district in a \"world of hurt.\" Potentially, one or two finance-related positions would be added, along with adding a stress onto the workload of school principals, Simmons said.\nAccording to the superintendent, he doesn't expect federal money or county allocations to drastically change heading into fiscal year '26. \"We knew '25 was the tight year,\" he said.\nAssuming no major changes are made to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to increase education funding, Simmons has an optimistic outlook. That's partly due to increased multilingual learner, special education and overall enrollment in the county.\n\"We are anticipating what should be a good budget year for Caroline County Public Schools,\" Simmons told the board.\nBLUEPRINTWhile there was positivity in the fiscal year 26 forecast, Simmons made clear to board members that the outlook could drastically change if state legislators enact major adjustments to funding in Blueprint.\nChanges to fiscal 26 funding \"can have absolute detrimental impacts to Caroline County Public Schools,\" he said, since Caroline County Public Schools is \"not a district that has extra wealth to go to to fill gaps.\"\n\"Not trying to paint a dire picture, but I don't want to paint roses where they may not exist,\" he said. \"They should. But I want to make sure that everybody in the public is very clear as well. It should be, but if they go changing things in the FY 26 formula, it will hurt in this county more so than others probably.\"\nState legislators may be tasked with discussions about Blueprint funding this winter, as the state faces a predicted budget deficit of $2.7 million for fiscal year 2026.\nBlueprint will require all schools to meet a minimum teacher salary of $26,000 by July 2026. Caroline County Public Schools has not met that mark yet, but Simmons said the district is making progress.\n\"We are still working to get our starting teacher salary up to the mandated $60,000 by FY27,\" Simmons said. \"We have done a great job through negotiations. We're roughly $5,000 away.\"\nLooking to the next budget cycle, salaries and maintaining adequate staffing levels are at the top of mind for the superintendent and his team.\n\"We need to stay competitive with salaries and benefits for all employees,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The parade took just over 20 minutes, which seemed like a long time for many of the children as temperatures reached the mid-80s.\nBrian Collison and his 14-year-old daughter, Constance, stood on a downtown corner, Brian playing patriotic songs on his trumpet with Constance accompanying him on the drums. The Collisons came from Denver, Colorado, to visit relatives in St. Michaels over the holiday weekend.\nFour friends from Crofton came to St. Michaels, the third time they marched in the parade. The four — Megan Elias, Ellie Cockrell, Taylor Sundick and Ella Davis — painted their faces red, white and blue.\n\"We love being patriotic,\" Sundick said.\nFollowing the parade a traditional Fourth of July program was held on the museum lawn starting with the Scout troop raising the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The program included patriotic and folk songs.\nThe Fourth of July weekend in St. Michaels concluded Saturday with Big Band Night at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum followed by fireworks at dusk. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed sees initial budget proposal\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education had its first look at the district's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 Monday.During a board work session Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones presented the draft budget, which totals $85.8 million in unrestricted dollars — an $8.6 million increase from fiscal year 2025, Jones noted.\nJones provided the year-to-year budget changes by looking at 12 different categories of expenditures. The areas in which increases were highest are fixed charges ($2.23 million increase), instructional salaries ($1.7 million increase) and other instructional costs ($1.47 million increase).\nJones added that while $9 million to $10 million in grants are expected next year, anticipated grant funding is more than $5 million less than last fiscal year. That drop in grant funding precipitated a portion of the rise in the requested unrestricted budget.\nIn Annapolis, it still remains to be seen how Maryland's expected $2.7 billion deficit is tackled and if legislative decisions will impact funding for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative.\nTalbot school leaders say budgeting will be a fluid process in the coming months as they keep an eye on state legislation and the Accountability & Implementation Board, an entity that ensures the state and county governments are correctly implementing Blueprint.\n\"There's one area where I did do a little bit of hedging our bets, on the conservative side,\" Jones said of the proposed budget. \"I don't think we'll know any of that until April or May. But as certain pieces of legislation gather steam and seem to gather support and seem likely, then I think we will work behind the scenes to figure out how we will address this if this comes to fruition.\"\nIn creating the draft budget, Jones and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district considered its top priorities: academic equity in math, an engaging environment for students and staff, recruitment and retention levels, and meeting Blueprint objectives.\nMonday's discussion included a breakdown of 33 proposed additional positions for the next fiscal year. The proposed budget includes a $3.6 million jump in salaries and wages.\n\"This list is whittled down, if you can believe it, from a longer list of wants and desires,\" Jones said. \"And it was very much informed by school administration. This is what they felt they needed in their buildings.\"\nADDITIONAL POSITIONSJones outlined the 33 additional positions that are in the requested budget. Six of those positions are for English for Speakers of Other Languages teachers, assistants or coaches.\nShe cited the district's need to serve its multilingual population, along with the state funding for multilingual learning, for adding the positions.\n\"Our (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program) data … demonstrates that we do consistently underserve our multilingual students,\" Jones said. \"And so, we just need to provide more resources there.\"\nBoard of Education President Emily Jackson asked if those English for Speakers of Other Languages positions will be difficult to fill.\n\"Because I know we've had problems — specifically with ESOL in the past — finding people who are qualified and had a desire to do that,\" Jackson said. \"And that's a quarter of the positions we're looking for.\"\nZulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies, said it's a challenge both in Talbot County and statewide. She said recruitment and retention are key aspects.\n\"We have to definitely start promoting earlier and just doing the best that we can,\" Jarmon-Horsey said. \"And doing things that are unconventional, like our on-site career fair that's going to be happening here this week.\"\nOther requested positions in the budget include: an art teacher at Easton Middle, a high school math coach, a middle school reading coach, four special education positions at Easton Elementary and a special education teacher at Easton Middle.\nOne athletic trainer to serve Easton High School and St. Michaels Middle High School was also on the proposed list.\n\"I'm happy to see that at the top of the list,\" Jackson said of the athletic trainer role. \"I would be in favor of two … making sure that we have coverage for all of our athletic events. I know sports parents, they have eyes on that.\"\nThe draft budget will be discussed again at Wednesday's monthly Board of Education meeting before the board hosts its joint meeting with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 22. On Feb. 10, the board will host a public hearing on the budget. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Witnesses, including neighbor Todd Hughes, reported hearing gunshots around 5 a.m., followed by someone knocking on a nearby door.\nPolice vehicles were first spotted in the area around 5:30 a.m., with tactical response escalating throughout the morning. At approximately 8:30 a.m., a SWAT-type vehicle with a large ram approached the house, officers repeatedly calling for the individual to come out, saying they wanted to \"check on him\" and were \"not there to hurt him.\"\nThe extensive operation disrupted community activities. Shortly before 1 p.m., parents were notified that students on bus routes near Flatland Road and Hilltop Drive would need to be picked up from school due to safety concerns. Radcliffe Creek School, the closest school to the incident, advised keeping students indoors.\nResidents in surrounding areas, including a trailer park near Sunny's Mart, were advised to stay inside.\nLaw enforcement personnel were observed in nearby woods, and a helicopter and drone were part of the operation.\nAt approximately 1:30 p.m., the subject voluntarily exited the residence and surrendered without incident. He was taken into custody and transported to a local medical facility for a mental health evaluation. Criminal charges are pending, Chestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon, lead agency on the incident, said.\nFlatland Road remained closed throughout the day, with motorists advised to avoid the area. Authorities used the Everbridge alert system to notify nearby residents of the ongoing situation.\nWhile initial police statements suggested no immediate public risk, neighbors expressed concerns about the incident's severity. The precise circumstances leading to the standoff remain under investigation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The capital fund budget came in just above $1 million.\nEaston's property tax rate will remain the same as it has been since 2008 — 52 cents per $100 of assessed value. The town is projected to bring in around $13.6 million in real property taxes, according to the draft fiscal year 2026 budget, slightly up from last year.\n\"When you compare tax rates across the region, Easton stands out,\" Cook said. \"We have the second lowest municipal property tax rate among surrounding towns, but we're also the largest community and provide the most comprehensive range of services.\"\nThe budget aims to equip town government departments with the necessary tools and training to do their jobs, Cook said. While \"it's not exciting as building new things,\" she said, it's an important focus.\nIn the draft fiscal year 2026 budget, just above $1 million is allocated for transfer to capital work. That's down from the around $2.2 million mark in fiscal year 2025.\nCook added that areas of government improvement will include adding safety features to town hall, providing leadership training to Easton employees and hiring a new town manager. The town has been without a permanent employee in that role since last August.\nExpenditure categories in the draft general fund budget include:\nPublic safety (police, fire, code enforcement, etc.): $11.5 million.\nPublic works: $7.1 million.\nGeneral government (financial administration, IT, HR, planning and zoning, executive functions, etc): $5.3 million.\nEconomic development: $503,000.\nRecreation: $192,000.\n\"This year's budget reflects a shift: from growth driven by outside funding to careful maintenance, steady service and smart planning for what comes next,\" Cook said Monday.\nA budget hearing is scheduled for the Town Council's next meeting on May 5.

    "content": "Cage-free egg bill cracks under pressure\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 760\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — A bill promoting cage-free eggs once got people excited but now it's stuck in committee, leaving sponsors uncertain if its future is on the sunny side.The measure would require all shell eggs raised or sold in Maryland to be cage-free by 2026. This would prohibit Maryland farmers with over 3,000 egg-laying hens from using what's known as battery cages, or conventional wire cages where hens are kept in close confinement.\nThe law would also require any eggs sold in Maryland supplied by other states to be cage-free.\n\"I think that we should be treating animals humanely,\" said House lead sponsor Del. Jennifer Terrasa (D-Howard County). \"I think that's the bottom line.\"\nBut despite early optimism, Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), the Senate sponsor, tells Capital News Service she doesn't expect the bill to advance this session, even though she thinks cage-free eggs are \"inevitable.\"\nA stalemate would be at least a short-term win for agricultural interests in their ongoing national fight with animal rights advocates. The Humane Society has been advocating for cage-free eggs across the country, recently launching a six-figure advertising campaign for this legislation in Maryland. Some farms have adopted cage-free practices voluntarily.\nMany farmers are against putting the requirement in law because of the increased cost of production, short phase-in period and potential for their birds to experience heightened health risks outside of the cage.\nFarmers want to make their own decisions for how to best raise their birds.\nSome advocates are surprised the legislation hasn't been successful in Maryland as other states passed similar laws regarding cages for farm animals. It's \"rare\" for Maryland to be behind on humane legislation, said Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, Maryland state director for the Humane Society of the United States.\n\"We've looked at what we consider the cruelest confinement practices,\" Bevan-Dangel said. \"And these battery cages are one of the most inhumane tools that are still being used when we look at the farm animal landscape.\"\nIf the bill were to pass, it's estimated that six million birds would come out of cages, Bevan-Dangel said. About 11 farms that produce shell eggs in Maryland meet the criteria of 3,000 egg-laying hens, Bevan-Dangel said, but the sale prohibition would affect birds in other states as well.\nAccording to state numbers, approximately 600 million eggs were produced in Maryland in 2022. About 10 million of those eggs came from smaller farms with fewer than 3,000 hens, which Bevan-Dangel said often use cage-free practices anyway.\nBut the farming community has pushed back on the legislation vigorously, citing financial concerns they say could put them out of business. Should surrounding states decide not to ban battery cages, Maryland farmers could be disadvantaged in the egg market, said Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau.\n\"We would be forced out of business, our employees out of work,\" said Bill Dix of ISE America, a Maryland-based egg producer.\nSome opponents argue there are cases where cage-free housing systems could even have negative effects on the welfare of hens. Access to the ground and other birds means more exposure to diseases, parasites and pecking order injuries, said veterinarian Matthew Weeman, legislative chairman for the Maryland Veterinary Medical Association.\nThe Maryland Veterinary Medical Association did not take a position on the bill but submitted informational testimony. Sometimes a cage is better for a bird and sometimes it isn't, said Weeman.\n\"We don't need a legislative mandate that says here you have to raise the bird this one way because that one way may not stand the test of time in perpetuity,\" Weeman said.\nMany supporters of the bill argue that the egg industry is increasingly shifting toward cage-free practices anyway. By June 2023, according to the USDA, the share of cage-free hens increased to 38% of egg-laying hens in the U.S. Even large restaurant and grocery chains have made cage-free commitments, thus contributing to the increase in cage-free practices.\nWeeman says this shift is not by industry choice, but instead by the work of activist groups. Some farmers are just giving in to the public pressure, he said.\nMandating cage-free eggs could price people out of buying eggs, farmers argue. In a 2023 report, the United Egg Producers determined that if regular eggs are taken from the market, the number of consumers who will forgo buying eggs will increase by 20 percentage points.\nBut Terrasa said this legislation would remove the cost of the premium for cage-free eggs, thus opening access to all Marylanders.\n\"I paid for it, that's fine,\" Terrasa said. \"But I think everybody should be able to make that same ethical decision without the cost of the premium on it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Staying open after hours, business owners and chamber members were able to network and get a peak at each other's storefronts.Chambers across the country have begun sponsoring \"crawl\" events where members are welcomed into businesses located close to each other, allowing participants drop-in visits to learn more about each participating business, sampling their products and meeting their owners.\"This was our first such event,\" said Chamber Executive Director, Linda Friday, of the Sept. 27 event. \"We were excited for our members to learn more about this special area of our community.We had nearly 70 participants registered to attend, with some never having even been in historic Stevensville before.\" The owners of the businesses were excited to share their history and success with Chamber guests as participants made their way through the few blocks on, and just off Main Street.Bill Huffnell, owner, and Amy Francis, director of Marketing and Communications, of Bay Point Wealth were on hand to greet visitors at their Stevensville office, which happens to be the historic Stevensville bank building of 1903. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and today still showcases the original ornamental pressed tin ceiling and vault. Huffnell provides the building as a site for the Kent Island Heritage Society to use on their tours for $1 a year.Members of the Historic Stevensville Arts & Entertainment District volunteers also greeted guests as they strolled Main Street; providing information on upcoming events, as well as regular activities taking place in the area, as was the Art East organization that supports local artists with regular meetings, trips, book discussions, and participation in community events.Across the street, Joan McWilliams's My Little Studio displayed the many talents of a shared-space gallery, where local artists and crafters rent space to create, show, and sell their work. Classes ranging from jewelry making to quilting are taught there as well.The sweets lovers were not disappointed. Over at the Tasty Toucan, owner Nikki Neboscynsky greeted chamber members Beth Mosner and Anna Hetzel, both from Miltec UV, who asked about her shop and how business was going.Mosner said, \"Lots of members were excited about this event. It's nice to learn more about what these unique businesses have to offer.\" Across the street at the Peace of Cake bakery, sisters Kirsten and Kim Cate were busy working in the open kitchen and receiving compliments from happy chamber members who were enjoying a variety of their freshly baked items.Owners and sisters Kirsten and Kim Cate started their business in the same location 22 years ago and are still going strong.\"Business is a challenge,\" said Kirsten, \"but baking is in our blood. For us, it's more than making a living.\" Chamber member Erich Krach, branch manager of Shore United Bank in Stevensville, said the crawl was his favorite chamber event so far. \"I enjoyed seeing their businesses and seeing what we can offer them for support,\" said Krach.Chamber Board Member Eva Stoops participated as a both a chamber board member and a business located along the \"crawl route.\" Stoops, co-owner of Chesapeake Environmental Lab, Inc., said she wasn't sure how the event would go at first.\"Right at 5 p.m. everyone started showing up,\" she said. \"It's a fabulous event for both the participating businesses and the chamber.Many people don't how much the chamber does in providing these kinds of services and resources.\" Jessica Dolbec, who volunteers for both the Historic Stevensville Society and the Arts & Entertainment organization and works for Improvement Zone that is located on Main Street, assisted the chamber with providing regular communication among the participating businesses.\"It's wonderful to see the businesses open at this time, normally they are closed by now,\" she said. \"I hope that this is a win-win for both groups.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nMaureen Wheatley is one of several local artists whose works are sold in My Little Studio in historic Stevensville owned by Joan McWilliams.

    "content": "Talbot County Democrats marked election night with celebration of campaign efforts\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Cheers filled the BAAM Center on election night as dozens of local Democrats watched votes roll in for the 2024 general election and celebrated the end of a highly divisive election campaign.To be in community among like-minded residents, Talbot Democrats hosted an election watch party filled with food, drinks, guests dressed in their best campaign gear and deep discussion about hopes and fears for the future.\nPatrick Firth, chair of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said this celebration was needed for the community on the Shore. Firth said the people gathered on Tuesday are the heartbeat of the Democratic community and more than anything deserved a celebration and to feel appreciated for all their work.\n\"We had a record of over 200 individual volunteers helping us throughout the election, from greeting voters to canvassing, to phone banking,\" Firth said. \"Talbot led the Eastern Shore this past weekend in canvassing, knocking on over 1000 doors in Talbot County.\"\nLined around the room were political signs showing support for Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks and Talbot County candidate for Board of Education Candace Henry.\nKathy Hostetter, resident of Wye Mills, said she was feeling hopeful Tuesday night though she understood the presidential race would be close. Hostetter shared her enthusiasm for Alsobrooks, who hours later would win a U.S. Senate Seat in Maryland.\n\"Talbot County is one of the most beautiful places,\" Hostetter said. \"We have a great state here in Maryland, we've got a great blue state. So tonight, we're very hopeful, and we want to keep it blue.\"\nHours after the party ended, former president Donald Trump triumphed over Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. Though initially expected to be a close race, Trump flipped several swing states in his favor and won the popular vote for the first time as a candidate.\nElection night was a mix of triumphs and defeats for Democrats in Maryland. Alsobrooks claimed victory over incumbent Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan. Additionally, Maryland voters overwhelmingly supported an amendment to Maryland's constitution for reproductive freedom.\nMichele Dappert, president of the Talbot County Democrat Party, said though Maryland is a famously blue state, this year's election has divided voters, especially in Talbot County.\nAccording to the State Board of Elections' unofficial 2024 General Election Results for Talbot County, over half of voters chose former President Donald Trump as their presidential candidate and an overwhelming number of residents voted for Republican candidate Larry Hogan for U.S. Senate.\nDappert said though there is political separation among those on the Eastern Shore, all voters have essentially the same end goal: to have their values understood, heard and put into practice.\n\"Look, I get it, politics can be contentious, but when you meet people locally at the door, most of us are just trying to get by, and we're just trying to send our kids to school, have clean water, be able to walk outside and feel safe no matter what you look like and who you are,\" Dappert said. \"And those are all very universal values, so I find it very important to defend them.\"\nSitting next to Dappert in a Kamala Harris camo cap and a blue shirt, which showed \"CLXXVII Minutes\" on the front and \"11,780 Votes\" on the back, was her father George Dappert. George Dappert explained the meaning behind his shirt.\nThe front represented, in roman numerals, the 186 minutes Trump watched TV during the Jan. 6 insurrection. The back represented the number of votes Trump was trying to find in Georgia to turn the state in his favor during the 2020 Presidential Election.\nGeorge Dappert said the Democratic Party has done everything they could in terms of getting out to vote, talking to people and getting the message out there for others to vote. For him, practicing the political right of voting is essential to democracy and he urges everyone to continue to be politically active regardless of major elections.\n\"It is what generations of our forefathers and foremothers have fought for, bled for, marched for, done everything that they could,\" George Dappert said. \"To willfully not vote is an abdication of your responsibility and what they have given from their past to our future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Experts discuss Mid-Shore impacts of human trafficking\n\n April 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 751\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Around 180 people attended the For All Seasons presentation on human trafficking on Tuesday night at the Avalon Theatre, where a panel of experts painted a picture of a changing landscape for trafficking crimes.With the increasing use of social media, traffickers find and groom their victims at home, a more methodical trust-gaining method than before the advent of the internet, they said.\nAccording to Thomas Stack, anti-human trafficking and sexual assault response manager for Mayor's Neighborhood Office of Safety and Engagement for the City of Baltimore, because young people's lives are so transparent online, traffickers can target individuals who are alone, mad at their parents and not doing well in school. Low self esteem is the target, he said.\n\"It is all about getting the word out there. Human trafficking has been around a long time, but the awareness has probably only been around for the last 20 years,\" Stack said. \"Maryland has a toxic mixture of both poverty and wealth. The poverty is a major risk factor for exploitation and the wealth is the buyers of sex, the people who are willing to purchase people for their pleasure.\"\nMaryland is also geographically vulnerable to trafficking, the experts said.\n\"We are two hours from Philly, three hours from New York, we have a lot of sporting events, we have two major cities, and we have airports and casinos, everything a trafficker wants,\" Stack said. \"Like we have the Preakness coming up. There will be a lot of males who have traveled here. The traffickers know that and will bring their victims of sex trafficking to service those males.\"\nThe speakers made it clear that human trafficking happens in the Mid-Shore community.\n\"There was a 15-year-old trafficked in Denton, so it is here,\" Stack said.\nBy becoming more aware of the problem, they said, community members can identify victims and reach out.\nHeather Amador, deputy director of victim services policy and programs for the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention and Policy, was one of the speakers. She said members of the community can look for signs of trafficking, like bruises, new tattoos and new suggestive clothing.\nRed flags can also appear online, Stack said, like if a teenager has multiple Facebook profiles with some that have nothing to do with their family or friends.\n\"Human trafficking is here. People don't want to believe that their neighbors are capable of such things,\" Amador said. \"A lot of human trafficking victims don't even identify as a victim. They see themselves as voluntarily engaging in it. They don't see the coercion that goes along with it. They are deceived to go down this path or forced into addiction. They think they are helping someone else out.\"\nAmador had one victim in her office who simply said she needed to make money. She was a runaway and had nowhere to go, Amador said, and she needed housing.\nAmador came across a case where a child had to perform a sex act to get lunch money in her lunch account and emphasized that that is trafficking too.\nFor All Seasons offers a host of services around human trafficking, from trainings, to getting the word out, to psychological services, to addiction services.\nBeth Anne Dorman, CEO and president of For All Seasons, says it takes a village to combat trafficking.\n\"Our anti-human trafficking efforts focused on a team-based approach,\" she said. \"We collaborate with law enforcement, first responders, Department of Social Services, child advocacy centers, school administrators, teachers and the hospital, officials from the towns and counties we serve.\"\nThen she introduced a video of Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, who created and helped pass legislation to make the Maryland Regional Navigator program when she was a legislator. This program supports survivors of trafficking. For All Seasons is a participant.\n\"Maryland recorded 118 cases of human trafficking involving 173 victims. This figure includes sex and labor exploitation. Child sex trafficking is also a concern. Since 2012 over 500 children have been identified by Child Protective Services as reportedly being trafficked in Maryland. This remains vastly under reported,\" Lierman said in the video.\nShe said she was committed to ensuring access to services for every survivor of sex trafficking in Maryland. She highlighted For All Seasons as \"essential to the safety and wellness of our communities.\"\nThe night ended with a call to action for the audience.\n\"It is a hidden crime so we all have to be alert,\" said Susan Ahlstrom, regional navigator at For All Seasons. \"We all have to be vigilant.\"\nFor more information on human trafficking and available resources, visit missingkids.org, polaris.com and netsmartz.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The winner takes home a trick-or-treat bag filled with $10,000!\" And that's $10,000 every episode.New contestants park their brooms at the kitchen door and take on Goldman and Pansino's cookie challenge every week, showcasing talent from far and wide.So far this season, the competing cookie confectioners have faced monsters big and small, exploring what would happen if our favorite Halloween treats had a taste for us, too. Bakers have been asked to: make two-sided trick-or-treat bags - with one side being light and fun while the other is dark and spooky - out of lemon candies, black licorice and peach rings; decorate cookies with scary self-portraits; craft life-size oozing zombie parts out of cookies, overflowing with gooey marmalades and jams; and create creepy, 3D haunted mirrors - each old and cracked with crunchy treats like kettle chips, pretzels and corn chips.This week, \"Edible stained glass is one of the most colorful and bewitching trends in the cookie world, and four cookie experts make glowing Halloween stainedglass cookies,\" the network promises.\"After one cookier is eliminated, the remaining three masters build giant, elaborate Halloween fun houses that would thrill any Halloween carnival-goer. The judges will really feel like they are at a carnival as the bakers must incorporate fun fair flavors like caramel apples, grilled corn, popcorn balls and deep-fried sandwich cookies.\" In the season's final episode, the final four competing cookie makers hope to scare the pants off hosts Goldman and Pansino by making edible, three-story haunted houses. Then, in the last round, Food Network has shared that, \"The three remaining cookiers host a séance by making playable spirit boards. To make sure there is maximum 'spirit' in their boards, they will include spirits like apple brandy, cinnamon whiskey, coffee rum and black currant liqueur.\" A rambunctious carnival filled with delicious treats, Season 2 of Food Network's \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" airs new episodes Mondays through October. \n \n Caption: Rosanna Pansino co-hosts \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Stories: U.S. Army veteran honored for 50 years with the DAV\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Ralph Gough began working with the Disabled American Veterans when he was medically discharged from the military in 1974, and last month — a half century later — he was recognized for his work.The Lexington Park resident, who serves as a judge advocate, received an award on April 27 for his 50 years of service with the St. Mary's DAV Chapter 26 in Lexington Park.\n\"It's a wild moment,\" Gough said as he sat at a picnic table at the Leonardtown Wharf a few days before the ceremony. \"Where has the time gone? I look at it from the time I've come in and I look around [now]. A lot of friends have passed on and I wish they could have been here. It's been rewarding. It makes me feel that that I reached someone [to help].\"\n\"It's cool,\" said DAV Chapter 26 Vice Commander James Williams, who has been a member of the St. Mary's chapter the past three years. \"He won't tell you but he's the go-to guy. If you have questions or problems he has the information.\"\nGough said the DAV is an important resource for veterans; its website provides a calendar of upcoming events, services and 28 links veterans can click on to access forms and information.\n\"It's helped improve communication with other veterans,\" he said, \"and it does [benefit] claims which helps us increase our compensation, and for those who don't get compensation it helps them get theirs.\"\nThe DAV Chapter 26 is open 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesdays at the Local Lodge 4 Machinist Union hall at 21795 Shangri-La Drive in Lexington Park. It has moved a few times over the past couple years.\n\"We don't have a home and we've been fighting that for years,\" Gough said. \"And if we did have a home where we could be open eights hours a day or whatever, we as veterans could come in and get together.\"\nGough was asked if the DAV is a type of fraternity for veterans.\n\"Yes it is, and once you get to know [the vets] and they start to come in and there's a bond that you never break,\" he said. \"My only downside is that I've met a lot of people who went to Vietnam and I had no overseas experience. I'm glad I didn't [have to go overseas], but it can be hard to bond [with those who have]. They have the stories and I can't imagine.\"\nGough graduated from Great Mills High School in 1968 and was drafted two years later. He was sent to Fort Holabird in Baltimore, then to Fort Dix, N.J., for eight weeks of basic training. He later attended Redstone Arsenal, Missile and Munition Center & School in Huntsville, Alabama, before being assigned to the 200th Ordnance Detachment GMGS Unit Training Command to begin on the job training. The GMGS is a type of grenade launcher.\nHe later went to Quartermaster School at Fort Lee, Virginia., to become a missile repair parts specialist, which he did the rest of his military career and made him eligible for promotion to E-5 Special Fifth Class.\nBecause of an injury to his foot, Gough received a medical discharge on Oct. 11, 1972.\n\"It helped me a lot,\" Gough said of the services he received from the DAV in the 1970s. \"They do it all for you. I've stayed around for 50 years just to see if I could help people.\"\n\"It's the most rewarding job I've had,\" Williams said. \"Every Wednesday my mind is set to help veterans, because every veteran has a different story.\"\nHe began working at the DAV in 1974 and has held several positions, including a stint as commander from 1993-1995.\n\"As long as I can move and have a little breathe [in me],\" Gough said, \"I'll always be there to help people.\"\nFor more about the St. Mary's County DAV Chapter 26, call 240-925-5439 or go to www.davch26stmarysmd.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republicans continue to push Talbot Board of Elections on election judge breakdown\n\n October 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — County Republicans continued to push the Talbot County Board of Elections to equal its selection of election judges during the board's monthly meeting on Wednesday morning.The breakdown by party was 62 Democratic judges, 50 Republican judges and 11 unaffiliated judges in September, according to Election Director Tammy Stafford. Local officials have indicated at meetings that the number of judges for each party may now be closer to equal, but this has not been confirmed by the Board of Elections.\nElection officials have said the makeup is \"fluid\" and will change up until Election Day. During Wednesday's meeting, Stafford said \"judges are always needed\" and that her office \"continuously\" accepts interest forms.\nAccording to Sept. 18 meeting minutes read aloud Wednesday, staffing for the election began in June of 2023. Training for those who filled out interest forms began in early 2024.\nIn the last month, concerns have circulated regarding a party imbalance of election judges, or those who staff polling places on Election Day.\nLocal officials, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and Talbot County Council Member Dave Stepp, have cited that the board is not in compliance with state law.\nMaryland election code states \"each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges\" from \"the majority party\" and \"the principal minority party.\"\nState election law permits judges not affiliated with either party for precincts with six or more judges, as well as \"one or more election judges who are minors.\" The number of unaffiliated judges \"may not exceed the lesser of\" the majority or minority party, law states.\nThese concerns led to a flurry of responses from state agencies emphasizing the security of the electoral process. In an Oct. 2 statement responding to a letter sent by Gamble to the Talbot Board of Elections, State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said voters should feel \"confident\" in the state's election security and \"compliance with the law.\"\nAttorney General Anthony Brown weighed in as well, writing a letter to Gamble on Oct. 7.\n\"Even at the individual polling place level, while all local boards make best efforts to achieve exact party balance, this is not always possible for reasons outside the local board's control, including the number of judges from each party who volunteer,\" Brown wrote.\nStafford stated at the Sept. 18 meeting that the training for election judges can no longer be done after Oct. 8 since the room used for training is also used for canvassing.\nDuring Wednesday's public comment, Gary Judy, a member of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee, said he's heard from Republicans who applied to be an election judge but were not told there are no vacancies for this year's general election. He said the fact that the board did not achieve exact party balance is \"extremely alarming to Talbot County voters.\"\n\"We decided to keep close track on it this year,\" Judy said, \"and can confirm that there were more than enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges to fill the available Republican positions of the equal representation required by Maryland election law.\"\nOn Wednesday, Judy provided board members with copies of a letter written by the Maryland Republican Party addressing election judge concerns in Talbot County. Adam Wood, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, later told the Star Democrat that the letter was a \"draft\" letter and had not been sent to the state board.\nShari Wilcoxon, also a member of the Republican central committee, spoke during public comment, asking the board to ensure \"parity\" of election judges.\n\"I think that it is an actual embarrassment that this board is allowing the executive director free rein to break the law,\" Wilcoxon said. \"It is your duty to hold her feet to the fire, and that she does what is Maryland law.\"\nWilcoxon questioned why election judge applications were denied in February and March.\n\"February and March had to do with the primary,\" Stafford responded. \"Let's be specific here. That was the primary. Those were the first people who were contacted for the general (election).\"\nThis led to tense back-and-forth between Wilcoxon and Stafford.\nBoard President Susan MacKinnon stepped in, asking Wilcoxon to stop speaking.\n\"You have had the opportunity to speak, you are now being disruptive,\" MacKinnon said to Wilcoxon. \"You are being disruptive, and if you continue being disruptive, I will call a recess and have you removed.\"\nWednesday's meeting was the board's last regularly scheduled meeting before the election Nov. 5. During Stafford's report to the board, she said \"logic and accuracy testing on the electronic equipment was completed\" on Sept. 16. The Board of Elections will have its logic and accuracy testing documentation available for public inspection Friday at 10 a.m. at 215 Bay Street in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A $500,000 grant was given to the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, which is funding STEM centers at 10 different schools in Maryland, including Lockerman.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said the foundation's contribution is bringing unique experiences to Lockerman students.\n\"There's no way that this level of resource and these tools would be able to get in the hands of our middle school kids if it wasn't for your partnership and Ripken Foundation's work,\" Simmons said.\nOn Tuesday, students showed off the new tools and gadgets that were funded by the grant, such as a 3D printer, coding robots and electronic kits. In the school cafeteria, two students flew drones.\nSixth grader Gracie Spiering showed off her knowledge of how to make backpack security alarms or model cars using littleBits Electronic kits. She knew how to order the kit's pieces and wires, and learned how the coding worked.\n\"It's been so much fun to have in class,\" Spiering said. \"Everybody's been so ready to come into that class.\"\nMeanwhile, many students have been utilizing the 3D printers to make ornaments for the holidays. Seventh grader Madison Watson said it's been a smooth learning process thanks to the help of her teachers.\n\"It's pretty fun to have them just at any time we really want them to be here,\" Watson said.\nLockerman Middle School Principal Jeannine Necessary said students love learning how to use the new materials. Staff members were trained and encouraged to integrate the STEM tools into everyday learning, the principal said.\nDuring the ribbon-cutting, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel said the healthcare system appreciates students involved in STEM because the students are \"highly motivated and educated.\"\n\"We're here to promote STEM because it's such an important part of the healthcare system,\" Kozel said. \"We're local, we're small, we're a community hospital system, but we need our community to help support our workforce needs.\"\nWith a handful of students excited to show off the new technology on Tuesday, Simmons reflected on how much the grant means to the Denton middle school, given the district's financial challenges.\n\"About 60 to 65 percent of our students qualify for free and reduced meals, which puts a little bit different lens on the opportunities that our kids have to access things,\" Simmons said. \"It also puts a lens on the opportunity the school system has funding-wise to be able to provide those avenues.\n\"We are thrilled that we were selected by you guys, in partnership with the Ripken Foundation, to be able to provide opportunity and access that we could've never funded for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the man declined, Gibbs allegedly started yelling aggressively as she accused the alleged victim of \"being smart with\" her and then ordered Hand, who was standing nearby, to kill him, police added.\nAt that point, Hand allegedly started beating the man with a \"metal blunt object,\" prompting the alleged victim to hold up a mattress to deflect the blows, according to the charging document.\nThen Gibbs and Hand cut open the man's tent with their knives, court records allege.\nThe man told investigators that Gibbs yelled, \"Stop,\" to Hand and, at that point, the suspects got into white 2019 Dodge Ram and sped away, police reported.\nAfter the suspects had fled, the man realized that his bicycle and $150 were missing, police said, noting that his bike is valued at $150. During the incident, the man's tent and mattress were destroyed, translating to a $500 loss, police added.\nCourt records indicate that the man told investigators that he was \"longtime friends\" with Gibbs, whom he described to police as \"an older white female of medium build with no teeth.\" He, however, did not know her last name — only that it started with a \"G,\" police noted.\nThe alleged victim described Hand as a \"middle aged\" white man of \"skinny build with face tattoos,\" police reported.\n\"Due to the suspect descriptions, officers believed the suspect description provided matched those of Brandy Gibbs and Justin Hand, who(m) officers are familiar with through prior contact,\" according to the charging document.\nWhen an investigator displayed photos of Hand and Gibbs, the alleged victim identified them as the suspects, court records show. Investigators were able to track down Hand and Gibbs and arrest them, police reported.\nHand and Gibbs are each facing numerous criminal charges, including home invasion, first-degree assault, robbery, theft, malicious destruction of property and related conspiracy counts, court records show. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Hundreds of people enjoyed boat docking contests, steamed local crabs, live music and family activities to celebrate the 13th annual Watermen's Appreciation Day hosted at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum on Sunday.Watermen's Appreciation Day brings people together to celebrate the longstanding history of watermen on the Eastern Shore, as well as fundraise for the Talbot Watermen's Association.\nJeff Harrison, president of the association, said the event began in 2010 and has grown throughout the years. For Harrison, the number of people attending every year shows the local community's support for watermen.\n\"There is this appreciation for the local watermen in this area and, of course, all over the Bay,\" Harrison said. \"And we are actually trying to grab a hold of that in some of our fundraisers and to let people know that we do appreciate them and that we're glad that they appreciate us also.\"\nHarrison, dressed in a yellow volunteer shirt, was part of a team of over a 100 volunteers assisting attendees and contestants.\nThe Harrison family were all part of the volunteer team. Ashley and James Harrison, along with a group of five boys under the age of 13, stood behind a volunteer table near crowded bleachers awaiting the boat docking competition.\nAshley Harrison said volunteering at the Watermen Appreciation Day event is a family tradition she married into and has decided to establish in her family. This tradition stems from her husband, who comes from a family of watermen and who began volunteering when he was a young boy.\n\"We like doing stuff for the children,\" Ashley Harrison said. \"We have three of our own, and we love seeing them have fun at events as well. And we like helping our community and showing our visitors that come here that this is a really great place to come and we're a tight knit community.\"\nUnder the sun, hundreds of people crowded and squeezed together to catch a glimpse of the boat docking contest. Boat owners of all ages showed off their skills and embraced cheers and support from the crowd.\nShannon Mitchell, vice president of engagement for the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, said this event is a part of a partnership between the museum and local watermen to benefit the watermen in their fundraising, sponsorship and silent auction work. The museum benefits from the admission intake, she said.\n\"This one is very much mission-focused in supporting our local watermen,\" Mitchell said. \"It's a big piece of why the museum exists to begin with. They tell a big story about the Chesapeake Bay and our region, so it's really exciting to see everyone come out and support them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Following the land sale from the church, the garden had to look for a new home and McKnight reached out to the County Commissioners over the summer for assistance.\nFormed in 2015 as the Galilee Community Garden, the Kent Island Community Garden serves the need for a community garden in the Harbor View area of Chester and has since blossomed to include church volunteers, local Master Gardeners, Boy Scout Troop 495 and neighbors of all sorts ready to get their thumbs green.\nThe community garden also partners with the University of Maryland Extension Master Gardeners Program for educational opportunities.\nThe garden offers many beds of vegetables, flowers, and a separate herb garden with an irrigation system and compost area.\nThe Maryland Food Bank cites that one in three Marylanders face hunger. \"With several of our gardeners in independent living facilities and one handicapped gardener, we realize how critical it is to establish a new space for our community garden,\" McKnight said.\nVoicing their appreciation for the garden, the county Commissioners approved a $1,500 grant to help the garden blossom at its new location.\nThe new location's property next to the offices of the Fire Marshal is an ideal location to offer sufficient land for growth along with the necessary utilities as well as close proximity to the Cross-Island Trail, local schools, and the public library.\n\"It's going to be a great resource for the county,\" McKnight said.\nThe Kent Island Community Garden is always looking for new gardeners and civic minded groups to help build garden beds, according to McKnight.\nThe all inclusive garden stakes claim in having the only handicapped-accessible garden beds in the county, he said.\n\"We are a diverse and unique group of twenty gardeners and are the only community garden in Queen Anne's County that is open to all, \" McKnight said.\nLooking ahead, the garden hopes to build a few garden beds before winter sets in and In the spring seeks funds to install a deer fence around the perimeter, he said.\nMore information about Kent Island Community Garden can be found by contacting McKnight at McKnightJohn143@gmail.com or 202-257-3754. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There will be a universal permit requirement in order to store food processing residuals. It creates limitations on how residuals can be stored and permits the county to fine violators.\nIt would require that those storing the material use closed-top containers, going a step further than recently passed state legislation.\nAttorney Stewart Barroll said commissioners and Caroline County staff had heard \"voluminous\" public comments that have been taken into account.\nPrior to voting, two amendments were approved by commissioners involving distances from the storage containers.\nCommissioner Franklin Bartz said he would prefer the storage distance and an occupied dwelling be increased to 2,000 feet measured horizontally rather than the 1,250-foot distance that was in the bill.\nAfter discussion, the commissioners unanimously voted to approve the change.\nCommissioner J. Travis Breeding requested a second amendment that would require the storage not to be within 500 feet of a well. This way, it would allow property owners to move wells somewhere else on their property to be 500 feet away from stored residuals to not contaminate water sources.\nCommissioner Larry Porter brought up the discussion of postponing voting on the act until the Maryland Department of Agriculture shares their regulations. The vote had been postponed at the prior two meetings so the commissioners could review the proposed amendments to the legislation.\nBreeding said there would not be a need to postpone for regulation changes because commissioners are acting well within the parameters of Maryland statue.\n\"There's only so much that the Department of Agriculture can do,\" Breeding said. \"Everything that we have done inside of this legislature is not in conflict with the statue that the state has.\"\nThe bill was unanimously approved by the commissioners and has been enacted into the county law. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DoCo Axe Co. aims to support community\n\n March 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — For DoCo Axe Co. co-owner Sabrina Franciotti, the business is about more than having fun.Although DoCo Axe Co. offers fun in multiple forms — from virtual reality escape room adventures to a virtual golf simulator to virtually-projected axe throwing games — Franciotti said the local business is also a great place to practice healthy coping mechanisms.\n\"Coming to a place like us is actually super beneficial to your mental wellness,\" Franciotti said. \"Being around other people doing this activity that we coach you through, we can help you with. ... It's cathartic to sink the axe in the wood.\"\nFranciotti, along with Rob Chase and her husband Carmen Franciotti, took over the business in December 2022.\nAlong with offering a place for people to practice healthy coping, DoCo Axe Co. wants to help the community in other ways.\nThis year, the local business started naming a DoCo Axe DoGooder of the Month. Every month, people can nominate someone who is doing good in the community. Whoever wins the title that month receives $50 from DoCo Axe Co.\nFranciotti herself is also working to do good in the Cambridge community and beyond. In 2022, she started a nonprofit called Homeless & Human, which works to advocate and resource share for people who are experiencing homelessness or on the verge of homelessness.\nFranciotti understand that the resources available to those experiencing homelessness \"far under-weigh the overwhelming needs.\" For years, she experienced homelessness as a single mother with two kids and a full-time job.\nTechnically, Franciotti said, she is still homeless, living with her sister.\n\"Most people are struggling to find housing,\" she said. \"Even well-employed people.\"\nOwning DoCo Axe Co. has given Franciotti the opportunity to make more connections in the community and get the word out about her nonprofit.\n\"We have a donation box,\" she said about DoCo Axe Co. \"We tell every single person who comes through the door what they're supporting is this.\"\nFranciotti said that conversation is important because a lot of the business' clientele don't know about the needs of the homeless population.\n\"So we can have this opportunity to chat with people about how it's teachers and nurses and the person who's working at the grocery store ... (who) are struggling to find housing and just survive day to day.\"\nAlthough DoCo Axe Co. has made itself a part of the community, it is facing multiple challenges as a local small business. Franciotti said the business is not currently making a profit.\nThe main challenges come from difficulties with staffing, a decrease in consumer spending and rising costs, from operating expenses to card processing fees, she said.\nFranciotti said the problems DoCo Axe Co. is facing aren't unique in Cambridge. She said other local business owners she has spoken with are facing similar challenges.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher said finding staffing is one of the biggest challenges local businesses are currently facing.\nThe reason for this challenge includes a decrease in the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in people retiring early and even a lack of childcare options.\nChristopher said that even if a person can find childcare, the cost can be so expensive that it doesn't make sense to work and pay for childcare.\nChristopher also said the expectations for people who are graduating school and entering the workforce aren't \"level-set with what the economy needs.\"\n\"So we've got to attack all three of these things to get the (staffing) problem solved,\" he said.\nPromoting a business and the cost of running a business are two other major challenges local businesses face.\n\"The dollars and cents,\" Christopher said. \"Because if you find the staff, can you afford them?\"\nThere are multiple ways that people can support DoCo Axe Co. — and not just with a wallet.\nFranciotti said learning about the business, having conversations about it, sharing and interacting with social media posts and even clicking on the website to boost its search engine optimization can all benefit DoCo Axe Co.\nAnd for those that have the means to support businesses with their wallet, Christopher said a dollar spent locally goes far in the community.\n\"You go to DoCo Axe and you spend that dollar, they're going to then use that dollar to pay for other things in the community, so it stays here,\" he said. \"That's the key. Rising tides raise all boats.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Deepening Divides - Democrats Split Over 'Anti-Zionism Is Antisemitism' Measure; Poll Shows U.S. Racial, Generational Differences Over Israel-Hamas War\n\n December 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 954\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday declaring that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism\" prompting a split among Democrats.A majority of House Democrats did not vote for the measure as a public opinion poll from Gallup shows substantial divides among Americans over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza by age, race and political persuasion.\nWhites, older voters and Republicans tend to back Israel in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks while younger Americans, people of color and Democrats disapprove of Israel's air strikes and ground invasion of Gaza aimed at the Islamic militant group, according to a poll released Nov. 30 by Gallup.\nThe congressional measure condemning antisemitism passed with support from 216 Republicans and 95 Democrats. The resolution's most controversial component was plank equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nZionism is a movement and belief system that supports the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East.\n\"Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThirteen Democrats voted against the measure and 105 Dems voted 'present' or did not vote neither supporting nor opposing the resolution.\nOne Republican - U.S.\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the anti-Zionism/antisemitism measure. Another four GOP lawmakers did not vote.\n\"Anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism,\" Massie said in a social media statement pointing to congressional remarks by U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, that some Orthodox and other Jews are not in agreement with modern Zionist constructs.\nNadler, the House's most senior Jewish members, said some Orthodox Jews believe only the Messiah can establish a new state of Israel and the measure can label progressive Jews and others critical of controversial judicial reforms in Israel as antisemitic.\nNadler and U.S. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, were among those voting present on antisemitism measure.\nThe 13 Democratic no votes came from progressives who have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\nOpponents of the measure - which referenced rises antisemitic vandalism and violence - included U.S. Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \"We must be steadfast and clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors and inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful,\" said Jayapal who had to clarify recent comments about whether she condemned Hamas' rapes and violence against women and girls in the Oct. 7.\nGOP SUPPORTS MEASURE U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, voted for the antisemitism measure along with Maryland Democratic U.S. Reps.\nSteny Hoyer, David Trone, Dutch Ruppersberger and Kweisi Mfume. Maryland Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes voted present.\nHouse Republicans overwhelmingly backed the resolution which labels some pro-Palestinian slogans as antisemitic.\n\"More Jews were murdered on October 7th than on any other single day since the Holocaust.\nLet that sink in. We have even seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be absolutely clear: such hate has no place in the halls of Congress nor our national discourse. It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and Members of Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and discrimination against the Jewish community,\" said U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tennessee, one of the main sponsors of the resolution.\nGOP backers of the measure point to a rise in antisemitic incidents and pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian rhetoric that calls for or insinuates the destruction of Israel. They also point to the 106 no or present that did not support the measure - 105 of them from Democrat.\n\"The world has seen a drastic rise of antisemitism since October 7th that is deeply disheartening and extremely concerning,\" said U.S. Max Miller, R-Ohio. \"Elected leaders must have the courage to condemn and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism.\nWhile I am glad this resolution passed the House today, I am disappointed that 106 of my colleagues failed to take this opportunity to condemn antisemitism forcefully.\" AMERICA DIVIDED The Gallup poll released Nov. 30 shows significant splits over the Holy Land war by race, political party and gender.\nThe polls shows 71% of Republicans back Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza versus support from 36% of Democrats.\nFifty nine percent of men approve of Israel's war in Gaza versus 44% of women, according the Gallup Among people of color, 64% disapprove of Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza while 61% of whites backs Netanyahu's efforts to dismantle the militant group.\nThere is a similar split my age with 67% of younger Americans (ages 18 to 34) disapproving of Israel's war against Hamas and 63% of voters 55 and older backing the Israel Defense Forces' military effort.\nPalestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 17,000 people have died since Holy Land war stared in October Israeli officials say Hamas fighters killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 terror attacks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Noa Mittelman, 15, center, and Maya Talby, 15, right, hold up flyers of people kidnapped by Hamas during a rally and march for Israel, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Wash.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Muslim protesters burn U.S. and Israel national flags during a rally against the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A demonstrator waves a Palestinian flag as Kenyan police officers fire teargas canisters during a protest against Israel and in support of Palestinians, in Nairobi, Kenya Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was an upsetting moment, and I just did what I could to help both in terms of the emotions of the folks as well as the physical reality of the situation,\" he said Sunday morning.\nThe fire, which involved a second-floor closet at the Y, was one of two that the Easton Volunteer Fire Department and other departments responded to at the YMCA Saturday, according to Easton Fire Chief JR Dobson.\nAt around 5:30 p.m., firefighters were once again called to the Y, where an HVAC unit was on fire on the building's roof.\nNeither fire resulted in any extensive damage to the building, according to YMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill.\nDobson said the first fire was extinguished by the Y's sprinkler system before firefighters arrived at the scene. The second fire was quickly extinguished by firefighters using a fire extinguisher after gas feeding the HVAC unit was shut off, the fire chief said.\nThe fires closed the Y for the remainder of Saturday, but regular operations resumed Sunday morning with all facilities but the racquetball courts open for use. The racquetball courts were largely undamaged, Gill said, but due to their proximity to the first fire, a sprinkler had gone off over them, meaning they had to be closed Sunday while staff worked to dry the area.\n\"We were fortunate there wasn't a substantial amount of damage to the building,\" Gill said. \"And now we're working with local authorities to provide any information we can to help them investigate.\"\nWhile the second fire's cause was ruled by the Office of the State Fire Marshal to have been a mechanical failure with the HVAC unit, Dobson said, the cause of the first fire is still under investigation.\nGill said the first fire is not believed to have been caused by any mechanical or similar failure.\nThough the fires did not cause extensive damage to the facilities, Hyman said the events were particularly upsetting for Y staff and regulars because of the role the YMCA plays in the Easton community.\n\"We're lucky,\" he said. \"Our YMCA is not just a place to work out and exercise. It really is a community. It's a very wonderful group of people… I've been a member of the Y for years, and it really is a community across cultures, all kinds of folks. And it's a really special place.\"\nDobson said multiple departments, including the Easton, Oxford and Trappe volunteer fire departments and Talbot County Emergency Services, responded to the events Saturday. These departments worked with staff and others on the scene to evacuate the building and secure the area.\nGill said although Saturday was \"a little bit of a traumatic day,\" the coordinated community response to the fires served as a reminder of the importance of the YMCA.\n\"The Y has been around for 168 years, so it's an institution in the community that serves one in three people, and it's wonderful to see so many people care for it at that level,\" Gill said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
