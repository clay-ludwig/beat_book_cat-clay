Sure, the Warriors were a heavy favorite, and took care of business early on the way to just their second win in five games.\nBut with key dates looming with Kent Island and Cambridge-South Dorchester next week, Easton not only got a desired result against the Indians (0-9) but a much-needed boost of confidence.\n\"We needed all the hits today because the past couple games we haven't really been hitting,\" said Orrell, who finished 3 or 4 with three RBIs, four runs scored and her second homer of the season. \"So I think that boosted our confidence level. And it definitely boosted the team morale.\"\nBrice agreed, especially after last week's losses to Stephen Decatur and Colonel Richardson, and Tuesday's setback at North Dorchester.\n\"Dropping the couple games last week really affected us,\" Brice said. \"So we really needed this one today so we can get some traction going into the meat of the season. We have Kent Island coming up. We have Cambridge coming up. Those are good ball clubs so we got to be on our toes.\"\nTownsend (3-3) seemed to be on her game from the beginning, fanning the first two batters she faced before plunking Amber Moore, and then striking out Aleah Shah to end the first.\n\"I feel my curve was really tight today, and I feel my riser was good as well,\" said Townsend, who notched all 15 outs via strikeout. \"I feel like I had a natural rise going on today and I got a lot of hitters out with that. I was focused. I feel like this is what we needed.\"\nJoseline Gabriel singled through the left side of the infield with one out in the second inning for Wi-Hi's first hit. But Townsend fanned the next two batters to end the frame, then struck out the side swinging in the third.\nThe Indians had their best chance to spoil Townsend's shutout bid in the fourth. Shah hit a one-out single to right and advanced to second on an error. Townsend struck out Kennedi Hull. Gabriel then reached on an error, sending Shah to third. But the Indians' lone baserunner to reach third would remain there, as Townsend got an inning-ending strikeout.\n\"I can't say enough about Sammy,\" Brice said. \"There was freshman sensation, then sophomore sensation. Now, she's a junior sensation. She needed this win as well. She had a couple of rough outings the past couple of games, but she needed the win.\"\nWicomico put two runners on in the fifth with two outs, but Townsend punctuated Easton's third shutout of the year with her 15th K.\nAfter scoring three runs on four hits in the first, Easton batted around in the second, pushing six more runs across with five hits. Gemma Vogel (2 for 3) opened the inning with a double, stole third and scored on an error. Lyla Roe (2 for 3, RBI), Orrell, and Townsend (3 for 4) each stroked singles in the rally, and Lane Kennedy (2 for 4, 2 RBIs) doubled.\nEaston widened its lead to 12-0 in the third before scoring six more in the fourth.\n\"We did what we were supposed to do today,\" Brice said. \"I can't complain. We hit the ball very well today. We haven't in the past couple of games. So today hopefully going into next week we keep the bats rolling.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This means he will serve no jail time.\nAdams said Schwaninger will have to serve five years of supervised probation, register as a Tier I sex offender and submit to supervision, meaning that he will have to comply with a sex offender management program.\nThe state agreed not to prosecute the remaining four charges Schwaninger faced.\nBefore handing down Schwaninger's sentence, Adams said that by obtaining and possessing the videos, Schwaninger was participating in the child pornography industry.\n\"The most important thing we can all do is protect children,\" she said.\nDuring the plea hearing, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale gave descriptions of the four videos that Schwaninger pleaded guilty to having. He said the children in the videos were real children, not created by artificial intelligence.\nCoale said that although Schwaninger had not manufactured the videos, his \"participation in that market allows the market to flourish.\"\nSchwaninger's attorney Thomas Maronick Jr. said his client \"looked at some pictures he should not have\" and didn't distribute them. Maronick said Schwaninger has since met with a counselor experienced in treating sex offenders. Maronick said the counselor did not feel that Schwaninger had a problem that requires \"lengthy\" therapy.\nThis was \"a crime of curiosity,\" Maronick said, later adding that Schwaninger didn't realize the industry he was supporting.\nSchwaninger told Adams that he came across the videos on social media toward the end of 2023.\n\"It was like watching a train wreck,\" he said about the videos. \"I know better.\"\nSchwaninger said the videos were on an old phone and didn't realize they were on the phone he was using at the time of his arrest. He said he thought he had deleted the videos. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Why are you running for Greensboro Town Council?\nTrust me, this was not planned or even an aspiration of mine however, once I started seeing my responsibilities as a homeowner becoming more costly with nothing changing for the better, I began attending town council meetings. I found like minded people asking the same questions.The more I showed up and listened, I realized that we've been going around in circles, with no improvement in sight. I finally decided to be a part of the change that I'd like to see.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nTo ensure that the most qualified people are employed by our town and ensure they have what they need to be productive and successful. To call for accountability of rental landlords and property owners on the upkeep and condition of their properties. If anyone needs help, we guide them to the resources they need. Sending out fines to already struggling families only causes hard feelings and more trust issues. Create and maintain safe neighborhoods by working with & alongside the Greensboro Police Department.\n3. Transparency with the residents has been questioned by Greensboro residents. How would you plan to be transparent with the residents?\nThrough honesty and respect, by allowing the community to have a voice in decisions that directly affect them. I would like to create a monthly/quarterly newsletter (put together by volunteers) that would include a calendar of events, our meeting dates/times, church services and our food pantry schedule.\n4. Multiple solar projects have been proposed for Caroline County. What rules should Greensboro have in place for these projects?\nUnfortunately you are asking this question a few months too late. I petitioned the courts along with 2 other residents to block Halo from being able to move into our town but because those that came before us and not looking ahead, we lost. We will need to look outside of the box and stay up on the local and state happenings so that we can stay ahead of the curve. Thinking that \"it won't happen here\" has not done our town much good. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This was the 14th year of the recognition awards.\nThere were six people honored for their work: Federalsburg's District One Councilman Brandy James, Principal of Federalsburg Elementary School Stephanie Brohawn, coach and volunteer William Eric Smith, community activist Cynthia Fletcher, Haitian community liaison Cederick Turner and Roberta Butler of the NAACP.\nBetty Jarman, the media spokesperson for Men For Change, said, \"The keynote speaker for this event was Vaughn Evans Sr. He was the principal of the North Dorchester Middle School in Hurlock.\nShe said, \"The Men For Change theme this year was 'Let's Get Busy,'\" which featured heavily in Evans' address.\nIn his speech, Evans urged the audience to get busy doing productive, positive things to support youth with the resources they need to become successful.\n\"They are our future leaders and enterprising entrepreneurs,\" he said.\nHe said that the essence of his message aligns with Colossians 3:23-24, which encourages community service and giving back. The bible verse starts, \"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.\"\nJames, whose son was in the program years ago, said she is something of a \"behind the scenes person\" for the nonprofit.\n\"I am just part of a puzzle, and it takes more than me to push the wheel. It is a community effort,\" she said. \"It was exciting to be acknowledged, but it was more exciting and more rewarding to see the others who were acknowledged.\n\"So much greatness being acknowledged — magnificent work. It is because of those individuals that so much goodness is happening in Federalsburg,\" James said.\nRecognizing these volunteers is part of MFC's mission. They want the community to know what is happening.\n\"This is important because we want the broader community to know the people that are doing outstanding volunteer, work without any fanfare. These people are not looking for recognition. We want them to know that we appreciate the work that they are doing,\" Jarman said.\nState Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) made citations for all the honorees, though he was unable to attend the event in person.\nA recent graduate who participated in the program was also honored Saturday evening. 2024 Colonel Richardson High School graduate Elson Davis was presented with a certificate.\nJarman said, \"The event was well attended by young people, young Black men. I thought that was a wonderful thing that they were there to support the honorees.\"\nJarman also took the opportunity to highlight an upcoming partnership between Men for Change and another local organization, the Federalsburg Activity Center.\n\"We are also partnering with the Federalsburg Activity Center and their after school mentoring program and other activities going on at the center,\" Jarman said. \"It is still in construction, but we hope it will be open by September.\"\nThis project, still under construction, is repurposing the Dollar General in Federalsburg. Men For Change is still open to receiving donations.\n\"Once the center is open, we will need more volunteers,\" Jarman said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The county's recent initiative to recycle single-use boat shrink wrap has resulted in a significant increase in the amount of plastic diverted from landfills.In the second year of the program, the Queen Anne's County government, in partnership with Plastic Free QAC and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, has seen a 370% increase in the amount of recycled shrink wrap compared to last year.\nThis year, a total of six tons pounds of plastic shrink wrap was collected and recycled, a substantial increase from the 1.62 tons collected in 2023.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil expressed his enthusiasm, stating, \"This significant increase in our recycling efforts underscores the dedication and commitment of our residents and businesses to protect our county. By expanding the availability of MTAM recycle bags and increasing the public awareness, we have made it easier for everyone to participate in this important initiative.\"\nKey highlights of this year's success include:\nIncreased participation from individual boat owner with a notable rise in the number of individual boat owners participating in the recycling program, showcasing the community's growing environmental consciousness.Expansion of recycling bag pickup locations; the program expanded from one to four convenient pickup locations for MTAM recycle bags, including:West Marine in Chester, Rommel's Ace Hardware in Stevensville, Centreville Town Hall and Refill Goodness in Stevensville.Commitment from local marinas and boat companies. Several local businesses committed to responsible disposal of shrink wrap, among them: Bay Bridge Marina, Bosun's Marine, Atlantic Yacht Services and Pocket Yacht Company\nThe MTAM recycle bags, sponsored by the County Commissioners, were provided free of charge and made available at multiple locations. The dedicated MTAM shrink wrap dumpster at the Grasonville Transfer Station facilitated easy and eco-friendly disposal for boat owners from early April to June.\nThis initiative is part of Queen Anne's County's broader commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability. By continuing to work together, the county aims to set an example for other communities across Maryland and beyond.\nPlastic Free QAC started in 2018 with the mission to reduce single-use plastic usage in general and places focus on education and building public awareness, according to Sara Shelley, president of Plastic Free QAC.\n\"We are really thrilled with the community response,\" she said.\nUnderstanding that old habits with single-use plastics can be hard to shake, Plastic Free QAC looks to continually build involvement by connecting with individual boat owners and hosting community-wide clean ups, Shelley said.\nFor more information about the recycling program, including where to pick up MTAM recycle bags and drop off cleaned shrink wrap, visit https://lnk.bio/RecycleBoatShrinkwrap. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of these items are to be completed to match the approved permit and site plan.\nWahl said Underwood and Associates is required to complete this phase of the project by April 19.\nIn December, the Commissioners of Oxford announced that although the Strand Beach project was signed off on in June by previous Town Manager Cheryl Lewis, the project had not been completed to the specifications that Underwood and Associates had originally presented.\nThe plan for the project was to create a berm, place hooks along the east and west areas of the Strand to bring in sand, create small islands in the water to reduce waves coming onto the beach and plant low marsh grasses on those islands. During the commissioners meeting in December, Commissioner Katrina Greer said not all the grasses had been planted on the islands and the islands were two feet higher in elevation than they were supposed to be.\nThat month, Greer brought together the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Underwood and Associates and the organizations that funded the project to ensure Underwood and Associates would bring down the elevation of the islands and take out the sand that goes out to the headlands at no cost to the town. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A LEGEND LOST - Orioles great and 16-time Gold Glove winner Brooks Robinson dies at 86\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 40 | Section: Sports \n \n 1312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE - Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, whose deft glovework and folksy manner made him one of the most beloved and accomplished athletes in Baltimore history, has died. He was 86.The Orioles announced his death in a joint statement with Robinson's family Tuesday. The statement did not say how Robinson died.The Orioles held a moment of silence before their game against the Washington Nationals, and the teams lined up outside their dugouts to pay their respects.Also before the game, fans gathered around the 9-foot bronze statue of Robinson inside Camden Yards.\"Great player, great guy on the field, great guy off,\" said fellow Orioles Hall of Famer Jim Palmer, who was overcome with emotion.\"Respectful, kind. And you don't meet too many guys like that. Brooks was a genuine person. There was no acting. Brooks was just a genuine person.\"Coming of age before the free agent era, Robinson spent his entire 23-year career with the Orioles. He almost single-handedly helped Baltimore defeat Cincinnati in the 1970 World Series and homered in Game 1 of the Orioles' 1966 sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers for their first crown.Robinson participated in 18 All-Star Games, won 16 consecutive Gold Gloves and earned the 1964 AL Most Valuable Player award after batting .318 with 28 home runs and a league-leading 118 RBIs.\"An integral part of our Orioles Family since 1955, he will continue to leave a lasting impact on our club, our community, and the sport of baseball,\" the team said.He finished with 268 homers, drove in 1,357 runs and batted a respectable .267 in 2,896 career games. Not bad for ol' No. 5, the boy from Arkansas.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred described Robinson as \"one of the greats of our National Pastime.\"\"Brooks stood among the greatest defensive players who have ever lived,\" Manfred said in a statement.\" He was a model of excellence, durability, loyalty and winning baseball for the Orioles.\"I will always remember Brooks as a true gentleman who represented our game extraordinarily well on and off the field all his life.\"MLB Player Association Executive Director Tony Clark cited Robinson's role as an advocate for his fellow players.\"Tributes to Brooks Robinson will duly note his brilliance at third base . But his impact transcended the field - as a prominent voice in the early days of the MLBPA and a relentless advocate for his fellow players through his work with the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association. His humanity, kindness, integrity and commitment will long endure.\"The Hall of Fame applauded Robinson's role as a member of its board.\"For generations of fans, Brooks Robinson's talent on the field was surpassed only by his incredible character and integrity. His love of the Hall of Fame brightened Cooperstown, as did his devotion to the Museum as a long-standing and valued member of our Board of Directors.\"Robinson will be forever remembered for his work ethic and the skill he displayed at the hot corner, where he established himself as one of the finest fielding third baseman in baseball history, whether charging slow rollers or snaring liners down the third-base line.\"Brooks was maybe the last guy to get into the clubhouse the day of the game, but he would be the first guy on the field,\" former Orioles manager Earl Weaver said. \"He'd be taking his groundballs, and we'd all go, 'Why does Brooks have to take any groundballs?' \"I wouldn't expect anything else from Brooks. Seeing him work like that meant a lot of any young person coming up. He was so steady, and he steadied everybody else.\"Robinson arrived in Baltimore in September 1955 as an 18-yearold after spending most of his first professional season in baseball with Class B York. He went 2 for 22 with the Orioles and struck out 10 times.He jockeyed between the majors and minors until July 1959, when he stuck around in Baltimore for good.\"I think maybe he always knew what it's like to be in the big leagues at 19. And then I think when you get to the big leagues, you get here, you got to stay here, you got to figure out how to get better,\" Palmer said. \"You have to decide who you want to be like. I think for all of us who knew him he was the best.\"Brooks Calbert Robinson Jr. was born in Little Rock on May 18, 1937. He eventually made Baltimore his home but never really lost his southern twang, which was just fine with fans in blue-collar Baltimore, who appreciated his homespun charm and unassuming demeanor.Dubbed \"Mr. Oriole,\" he was a sports hero in Charm City, in the pantheon with former Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas and Orioles infielder Cal Ripken, who performed for a different generation.Many Orioles rooters who never got to see Robinson play still were able to enjoy his observations as he was part of team broadcasts.Ripken was known as The Iron Man because he played in 2,632 consecutive games, but Robinson wasn't fond of sitting on the bench, either. From 1960-1975, he played in at least 152 games in 14 seasons and in 144 games the other two years.\"I'm a guy who just wanted to see his name in the lineup everyday,\" he said. \"To me, baseball was a passion to the point of obsession.\"Robinson retired in 1977 after batting only .149 in 24 games. His jersey was retired that year.Robinson's most memorable performance came as MVP of the 1970 World Series, when the Orioles bounced back from their stunning defeat to the New York Mets the year before and Robinson redeemed himself after batting just 1 for 19 in that series.Because he was so sensational in the field during Baltimore's fivegame triumph over the Reds, few remember he hit .429 and homered twice and drove in six runs - or that he made an error on his first play in the field.In Game 1, Robinson delivered the tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning. One inning earlier, he made a sensational backhanded grab of a hard grounder hit down the line by Lee May, spun around in foul territory and somehow threw out the runner.Robinson contributed an RBI single in the second game and became forever a part of World Series lore with his standout performance in Game 3. He made a tremendous, leaping grab of a grounder by Tony Perez to start a first-inning double play; charged a slow roller in the second inning and threw out Tommy Helms; then capped his memorable afternoon with a diving catch of a liner by Johnny Bench. The Series ended, fittingly, with a ground out to Robinson in Game 5, a 9-3 Orioles win.\"I'm beginning to see Brooks in my sleep,\" Reds manager Sparky Anderson said during the Series.\"If I dropped this paper plate, he'd pick it up on one hop and throw me out at first.\"Anderson also said, \"He can throw his glove out there and it will start 10 double plays by itself.\"Palmer and other teammates would say that the country got to see what Robinson did routinely during the regular season. Robinson used to blush when asked to recall his heroics in October 1970.\"I tell people that I played 23 seasons and I never did have five games in a row like I did in that World Series,\" he said. \"It was a once in a lifetime five-game series for me, and it just happened to be in a World Series.\"His legacy in Maryland continued long after his retirement.There's a Brooks Robinson Drive in Pikesville, and the annual state high school All-Star game played at Camden Yards is named in his honor. \n \n Caption: Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson played in 18 All-Star Games and led the Orioles to two World Series titles.\n \nOrioles third baseman Brooks Robinson (5) leaps across the infield to congratulate pitcher Dave McNally (19) and catcher Andy Etchebarren after the final out of the 1966 World Series against the Dodgers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The juvenile allegedly stabbed the woman multiple times during an altercation.\nThe 16-year-old suspect, who was not publicly named, is charged as an adult with attempted first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to injure.\nPolice also arrested Franky Florestal, 29, and charged him with two counts of accessory after the fact to attempted first-degree murder.\nFlorestal, a Federalsburg resident, posted $5,000 unsecured bond following a bail review Thursday, according to court records.

He wanted to pitch.\"\nDustin Blue pitched three-plus innings of two-hit ball before running into a jam in the fourth inning, but by then the Warriors had built a lead that was never in jeopardy en route to an emotional 11-2 victory.\n\"He wanted to play last night,\" Pritchett said of Dustin Blue. \"As soon as we knew (of Matt's passing), the kids, the players and families wanted to play. We felt that was the best way to honor Matt. Matt would have wanted us to play. I think we showed it was the right decision.\"\nMatt Blue was a three-sport athlete at Easton High before graduating in 2002. He went on to play goalkeeper for Salisbury University's soccer team before returning to teach in Talbot County. The former boys' head soccer coach at Easton High, he was diagnosed with cancer in December, 2022. Matt continued teaching at Easton Middle School, and remained an assistant on Easton's varsity baseball team until he passed Friday. Matt Blue was 40 years old.\n\"I thought the kids responded,\" Pritchett said. \"They loved Matt Blue. They loved the coach. The community has a tremendous loss. It's going to be hard to replace him. I don't think we will.\n\"So I thought the kids, in the face of a lot of emotion, a lot of feelings, and a lot of loss, they did a good job,\" Pritchett continued. \"They were here together playing the sport they love, supporting Dustin, the family. I'm very proud of them.\"\nMatt Blue gave a speech prior to last year's St. Michaels at Easton game on April 13. Before Saturday's game, the public-address announcer reminded players, coaches and the large home crowd settled behind the backstop of one of Blue's main themes of recognizing the moment.\nHis son did just that on a wind-chilled afternoon of gray clouds and big patches of blue sky.\n\"It's incredible,\" Southern head coach Kyle Lynch said of Dustin. \"The effort. Obviously the emotion. You don't know what's going through his head, but he threw tremendously. He was great. We have a lot respect for them and coach Pritchett. But what Dustin did was truly pretty special. Been around baseball for a long time and haven't seen anything like that.\"\nDustin's first pitch of the game was a strike to Thomas Martin. He got Martin on a grounder to short, then hit JC Wilson with a pitch. Easton catcher Colin Moody threw out Wilson trying to steal second then watched Dustin get a called strike three on Gavin Crandall to end the inning.\nEaston's starting pitcher issued a one-out walk to Owen Meyers in the second, induced Andrew Cook into a fielder's choice, then zipped a pickoff throw to first that led to Cook getting caught in an inning-ending rundown.\nSouthern's Brendan Hinkle was hit by a pitch to lead off the third. But Nick Youmans grounded into a fielder's choice, struck out Dylan Clarke looking before Martin hit a deep fly that Warrior left fielder Carter Mooney made a nice play on.\nWilson lined Dustin's first offering of the fourth sharply through the middle for Southern's first hit. Wilson was erased on a fielder's choice. O'Brien was then hit by a pitch before Meyers dumped a singled into shallow left, loading the bases. Cook hit into a fielder's choice to plate the Bulldogs' first run before Pritchett came out to relieve Dustin with Garrett Fink.\n\"I thought he threw great,\" Pritchett said of Dustin (2-0), who remained in the game at shortstop. \"I think (he threw) 60-something percent strikes. He commanded all three of his pitches. Again under a tremendous amount of pressure and emotion. Just showed a lot of character; lot of grit. It's a tremendous effort again in the face of tremendous loss and emotion. He's a tough kid. I'm proud of him.\"\nEaston (3-1) scored all the runs it needed during a six-run second inning — all with two outs — against Bulldogs starter Crandall (1-1). Carter Mooney began the scoring, lining a stand-up RBI double down the left-field line. After Cullen Murphy walked, Dylan Cassell roped another run-producing double to left. Murphy scored on a wild pitch. Josh Dressler (2 for 4) singled to score Cassell for a 4-0 lead. Dressler eventually scored on a wild pitch before Dustin capped the scoring with an infield, RBI single.\nThe Warriors tacked on another five runs with two outs in the third for an 11-0 bulge. Murphy singled to center off reliever Rhett Dorval and was lifted for courtesy runner Mikey O'Connor. Cassell was hit by a pitch. Dressler singled into the hole at short, plating O'Connor. CJ Dugan (2 for 4) delivered the inning's big blow with a two-run single. Dustin (2 for 4) followed with an infield single.\nFink, who escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, yielded a run in the fifth, but didn't give up a hit in two innings. He was relieved with two outs in the bottom of the sixth by O'Connor, who struck out three of the five batters he faced to close the win.\n\"I think it's a healthy distraction,\" Pritchett said of playing the game. \"I think the kids needed it. They wanted it. And they proved it was a good decision for all of them. I thought their energy was high. They were positive despite the emotion.\"\nAfter the game, Pritchett handed the game-ball to Dustin.\n\"Dustin looked fabulous,\" Pritchett said.\nCOLONEL 10, NORTH DORCHESTER 5\nAMERICAN CORNER — Senior Daniel Hesson hurled a complete game Saturday morning, striking out nine, as the Colonels remained undefeated.\nDerrick Mitchell hit a two-run homer for Colonel Richardson (5-0) and finished with three RBIs. Jordan Regulski and Johnny Beaven each had two hits.\nSOFTBALL\nNORTH DORCHESTER 7, COLONEL 2\nAMERICAN CORNER — Emilee Cohee surrendered four hits, struck out 12 and issued one walk Saturday as the defending Class 1A state champions stayed unbeaten.\nCohee, Mackenzie Lewis, Maggie Hubbard and Maddie Nagel (two RBIs) each had two hits for the Eagles.\nMakayla Newcomb suffered her first loss of the season as North Dorchester totaled 11 hits. Newcomb struck out six and walked two. Aubrey Taylor led Colonel with two hits, including a double.\nQUEEN ANNE'S 8, CHESAPEAKE 5\nCENTREVILLE — Abbie Denes blasted a three-run homer in the first inning and Autumn Huber was 3 for 4 with a four-inning homer Saturday to lead the Lions.\nCaroline Taylor and Reece Brooks each had multiple-hit games for Queen Anne's. Hannah Martin earned the win, allowing just one run and four hits over six innings.\nBOYS LACROSSE\nEASTON 9, STEPHEN DECATUR 8\nBERLIN — Drew Schmidt scored the game-winner in overtime Friday night as the Warriors edged the Seahawks in a rematch of last year's Bayside Conference championship.\nSchmidt finished with a hat trick, Hudson Royer had four goals and an assist, and Tyler Rardin added two goals for Easton (1-1). Warrior goalie Jack Kilbourne made 11 saves.\nGIRLS LACROSSE\nNORTH CAROLINE 14, J.M. BENNETT 5\nSALISBURY — Claire Blue scored four goals and Riley Walstrum had a hat trick to go with three assists Friday to pace the Bulldogs.\nReece Bisesi and Ashlynn Bisesi (assist) had two goals apiece for North Caroline.

A second survey taken two weeks later showed the same thing. According to the news release, the fractures were \"deemed highly indicative of non-accidental injury\" by Johns Hopkins medical staff.\nAccording to the news release, witnesses at trial testified they had observed Kautz shaking the 1-year-old boy on multiple occasions in 2022. Witnesses also testified to observing bruises on the child's body when he was returned from visitations with Kautz.\n\"These cases involve children who are too young to testify or to speak on their own behalf and are therefore difficult to prosecute,\" Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said in the news release. \"We are extremely grateful to the investigators at the Talbot County Department of Social Services, Easton Police Department and to the doctors at Johns Hopkins who came together to achieve justice in this case.\"\nKautz's sentencing is scheduled for June 10. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voter turnout: 13M more nonvoters than Trump backers; Harris got 10% fewer votes than Biden\n\n November 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1205\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 89 million voting eligible Americans didn't vote in the 2024 elections, according to the latest tallies collected by the University of Florida's Election Lab.That accounts for more than 36.4% of the U.S. total electorate of 244.7 million people (voters and nonvoters).\nThere are still some votes being counted in California and Arizona.\nBut as it stands as of Thursday, Nov. 14, there were 13.2 million more nonvoters than supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race.\nTrump — who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris — has received close to 75.9 million votes, according to tallies Thursday from The Associated Press.\nThat accounts for just over 50% of the popular vote. But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate — Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel . The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas's 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The monthly sewer usage rate is currently $10.98 per 1,000, and it is proposed that it go to $11.48 per 1,000.\nThe base fees would not be increased, but the usage fees would be. Commissioner Brian Schmidt, council president, said that though the council does not like to increase fees, the town is in \"desperate\" need of it.\nSchmidt said Trappe currently has three pumping stations that need repair, which would cost roughly $3 million. He also added that Trappe has a $13 million wastewater treatment plant that also needs repairs.\n\"While we hate to increase rates, the financial stability of the town is kind of in need of it,\" Schmidt said.\nAdditionally, the council approved introducing Ordinance 2-2024, adopting the FY2025 budget. This budget established a property tax rate of 33 cents per $100 of assessed real property value and 75 cents per $100 on commercial or business, personal property or public utility.\nIt also established an annual fee of $182 per residential household for trash collection service and adopted an enterprise budget for the town's water and sewer operations.\nErin Braband, Trappe administrator, pointed out that the tax rate for assessed real property and business personal property is not increasing, and the trash rate is not increasing.\nFinally, the council approved the transfer of wastewater allocation from six lots in the Lakeside at Trappe development to the community pool for Lakeside residents.\nLakeside has purchased 120 units and issued 114 permits for homes to be built. The remaining six lots will go toward the community pool.\n\"We're transferring the sewer allocation from those six lots to the community center lots, so there's sewer allocation for the restrooms in the community center,\" Attorney Ryan Showalter said. \"And this agreement basically says we're not going to build houses on those lots for occupancy, we're not gonna open anything for occupancy until the new treatment plant is open.\"\nThe council unanimously approved the agreement for wastewater allocation and development restrictions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "How much growth is too much for Easton? Balance between housing needs, infrastructure unsettled\n\n August 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1988\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The predicament on the minds of many Easton residents and leaders continues to be just how much the town can afford to grow.Easton is under a period of significant residential growth with multiple large-scale housing projects under construction. In 2000, the town's population was 11,708, according to census data. Ten years later, it rose to 15,945, and since, it's grown at a slower pace to 17,101 in 2020.\nThe boom has raised a litany of concerns, from increased traffic to a change in the town's small-town complexion.\nSome residents, and a few officials, think Easton should press the brake pedal. But local real estate agents contend that a halt to growth could box out lower- and middle-class buyers and renters.\nMartha Witte Suss, an associate broker for Coldwell Banker Realty and Easton resident, said the housing market has been in a crunch since the pandemic. She said there's not enough reasonably priced homes or rentals to satisfy employees who commute from outside Talbot County.\n\"We have plenty of housing that they can't afford,\" Suss said. Residential growth, if it focuses on affordability, could cure that dry spell, she added.\nMichael Ports, vice chair of the Easton Planning Commission, poses the town's conundrum like this: \"What are the housing needs of the people currently, and can we achieve that in a way that doesn't compromise everyone's needs for services?\"\nIt's a question town leaders are taking on, even if there's no easy answer.\nThis fall, 136 apartments on Elliott Road will begin opening. Two large communities are under construction east of Route 50, combining for over 450 projected single-family homes. Near Easton's downtown, a developer plans to transform two former Perdue AgriBusiness sites into housing projects, totaling 144 units.\nIn all, roughly 1,127 units are recently finished, under construction or approved by the town's public bodies, according to information from town planners and developers of the 17 listed projects.\nThe pipeline of projects has yielded varying opinions from town leaders. Some don't want any new large housing projects approved in the next few years. Others prefer a case-by-case approach.\nMayor Megan Cook said the right answer is \"probably somewhere in between.\" The town should focus on the current projects but not be too quick to disregard new ones, she said.\nThe mayor said growth is a charged topic and especially complicated due to affordable housing needs. No solution is a \"silver bullet,\" Cook and others have repeatedly said.\n\"It is a balancing act,\" Town Council President Don Abbatiello said. \"There would have to be a project come along that would fit that need, that workforce housing, that affordable housing piece.\"\nIn interviews with The Star Democrat, Easton officials weighed in on the town's current list of housing developments. When asked about infrastructure, the most recognized concerns included roads, fire and police services and schools.\nThey offered thoughts on where the town should focus its residential growth. Most leaned toward building from the inside-out. Planning Commission Chairperson Phil Toussaint is of that opinion. He hopes the sprawling, single-family developments are coming to an end.\n\"We wouldn't really want to support any development on the outskirts at all,\" Toussaint said.\nAnd broadly, the 1,127-unit mark can be misleading since some units aren't under construction and may not be for years, Toussaint and others said.\n\"(People) think they're gonna appear tomorrow,\" Toussaint said. \"They're not.\"\nSingle-family home neighborhoods typically take years to build out, such as Easton Village off of St. Michaels Road, a project of around 250 homes first approved in 2003 and just now reaching completion. So far, the 200-home Gannon Range and 252-home Four Seasons projects only have 18 and 11 building permits, respectively, according to Easton planning and zoning director Miguel Salinas.\n\"It's a daunting number. It's hard to hear,\" said Cook, who as mayor doesn't have a vote on housing applications. \"But at the same time, you look at some of the examples as a community, the neighborhoods that we've had. They're built out over 20 years.\"\nTHE PIPELINE\nSince town planners prepared a list of Easton housing projects this winter, chatter of \"the pipeline\" has been frequent at Town Council and Planning Commission meetings. Those two bodies are responsible for approving most of the projects.\nThe commission is made up of volunteer members and often can only make a recommendation to the council, whose members are elected. But sometimes, the commission holds final say, such as when it approved the 116-apartment Easton Crossing complex on Brookletts Avenue this year.\nThe five members of the council and six members of the commission offer a range of opinions when it comes to the town's growth.\nTown Council Ward 3 representative David Montgomery provided perhaps the most rigid perspective.\n\"I want to stop for at least five years before we add anything more to this backlog,\" Montgomery said. \"I want to see how fast it actually grows, it's actually built out.\"\nOthers were less firm on completely stopping growth, though all council members interviewed for this story said, at the very least, the town needs to be mindful. Some prefer a project-by-project approach, such as Abbatiello, who said future housing proposals need to be the \"right fit\" for Easton.\n\"I think right now, there's enough in the pipeline for us to say, 'Let's see how the projects impact the town's resources before we go adding a lot more to that list,'\" Abbatiello said.\nPlanning Commission members have mixed thoughts, too.\nPorts, the commission's vice chair, said Easton is \"missing a good bit\" even with the current project inventory. He said the missing units largely fall between expensive single-family homes and for-rent apartments — a sphere urban planners call \"the missing middle.\"\n\"The reality is that the median sale price of a home right now is almost twice what a family of four making the absolute average income here in Easton can afford,\" Ports said. According to Maryland Realtors, the July 2025 median sales price in Talbot County was $545,000, the third highest in the state.\nTom Klein was the commission's lone vote against the Easton Crossing project, citing traffic and parking concerns. He said the need for more affordable housing is clear. But Klein would prefer to have a target number. At times, it feels like Easton is \"chasing something\" it doesn't know, he said.\n\"How many more do we need? Do we just keep assuming we keep needing more?\" Klein asked. \"That, to me, is something I don't really know the answer to. I think it would be helpful to know that so we don't just blindly build.\"\n'MORE AND MORE CROWDED'\nTown planners and engineers have processes to gauge the impacts residential projects will have on the town, such as traffic and environmental studies or reviews by the town's nonprofit utility, sewer and water company, Easton Utilities.\nEven with project-specific studies, many town leaders believe traffic is a top-of-list concern, along with other infrastructure matters.\nMontgomery said town staff should be \"much more skeptical about the traffic impact studies\" submitted alongside housing proposals. Ward 4 representative the Rev. Elmer Davis said the traffic issue is obvious to the human eye.\n\"I don't need a traffic study to tell me that the traffic in Easton, periodically, is a problem at best,\" Davis said.\nHandling traffic backups is a tricky matter, Cook said, since some roads are state-run, others are under county purview and many downtown are maintained by town engineers and public works employees.\nOff of Route 328, or Matthewstown Road, 136 apartments are opening soon, while 200 single-family homes will be built just down the road. It's an area residents have flagged during council and state transportation meetings.\n\"(Route) 328 is going to become busier and busier, and folks, I fear, are going to have more and more challenges getting out to (Route) 50,\" said Councilmember Robert Rankin, who represents residents in the Route 328 area.\nA State Highway Administration planning and environmental study is underway to assess pedestrian and traffic needs on the busy state road that funnels onto Ocean Gateway. Previously proposed concepts by the state include adding left-turn lanes on Matthewstown Road and adding a second through lane on Goldsborough Road as drivers cross Route 50.\nTraffic has consistently been brought up as a reason to lean away from annexing land for residential growth outside of Easton's core. Nearly all commission and council members interviewed for this story said they prefer to keep growth within the area encircled by Route 50 and Easton Parkway (322).\nThe Planning Commission has especially expressed that preference during workshops updating the town's comprehensive plan, which lays out the town's vision for handling growth in the next decade.\nIn July, the commission rejected the Fox Chase Estates, a 365-unit, mixed-use development proposed near a warehouse and industrial park north of Easton Airport and near the under-construction Shore Regional Health hospital. Town Council members maintain final voting power on the project, though it's unclear when or if it will come before them.\nThe Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend against the development, citing a lack of connectivity as a main reason. The vote lines up with the commission's recent direction as they draft the new comprehensive plan: build from the inside-out.\n\"We'd rather see infill,\" Klein said. \"We want to see connected neighborhoods.\"\nThat line of thinking, shared by many Town Council members, still leaves Easton with infrastructure challenges, such as downtown streets, utilities and safety. The latter was emphasized by Cook and council members as a chief priority.\nFunding for the Easton Police Department and Easton Volunteer Fire Department makes up around 40% of the town's general fund budget. Abbatiello, who volunteers for the fire company, wants to hold off a massive increase in the cost for fire services by maintaining the department's volunteer status for \"as (long) as possible.\"\n\"The biggest tax increase residents of Easton are ever going to see is if the Town of Easton needs to go to a paid (fire) department,\" Abbatiello said.\nEaston Utilities evaluates water demands annually. According to a statement from Doug Abbott, director of engineering and water/wastewater departments, the utility is using 60% of its water and wastewater capabilities, leaving 40% \"to accommodate future growth.\"\nAnd as for downtown traffic, some town leaders are worried infill will do more harm than good.\n\"Our streets are becoming more and more crowded, and I am concerned the more that we have infill development, the harder it is to maneuver around this town,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said at a comprehensive plan workshop Aug. 25.\n\"I just don't accept that assumption,\" Toussaint, the commission chair, later said. He argued that concentrating growth downtown will take cars off town streets and improve walkability.\nOverall, the Aug. 25 meeting yielded a key takeaway: the new comprehensive plan is likely to include a preferred annual population growth rate around 1.75%. Planners initially proposed not to mark an annual growth rate in the plan, a change from the 2010 version, which stamped the rate at 1%.\nTown Planner Lynn Thomas said at the meeting that without a growth rate, the plan would use historic projections to determine if the town should consider adopting policies to remedy growth trends either \"significantly lower or significantly higher\" than expected.\nBut Town Council members said a rate should be clearly stated to keep the town honest.\n\"I do think it would be helpful to have at least something to point toward,\" Rankin said. The Planning Commission will adjust the drafted plan later this fall, likely reinstating an annual growth rate, before hosting a public hearing.\nThe town's Affordable Housing Board and Attainable Housing Task Force are other bodies taking cracks at addressing the housing-growth debate. The task force is currently producing a list of recommended housing policies for the Town Council to consider.\nCook acknowledged that while town boards and discussions are great, \"actionable items\" — such as the comprehensive plan and policies — are on the way and will bring true benefits to residents. But nevertheless, she's happy Easton is addressing its growth problem head-on.\n\"No one else around here is having these conversations, but the Town of Easton is,\" Cook said. \"They're difficult conversations. They're polarizing conversations, they're very emotional conversations. But we're having them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thanksgiving leftovers: What to do with them\n\n November 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1137\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thanksgiving dinner is over, and there are lots of leftovers to be eaten in the days to come. My family always said the first round was great, the second round was good and thereafter was \"OK.\"Today I will share some recipes and ideas for moving those foods.\nLine the countertop with plastic containers that have lids to package small individual meals. Place a small amount of each food in the containers to be reheated. Lunch is packed or a quick meal-on-the-run. Maybe a shut-in or elderly neighbor would appreciate a dish or two.\nFreeze any food that could be eaten in a week or so. Those turkey leftovers are great frozen to be used in that pot of soup on a cold winter day, especially the carcass with a little meat on it.\nTURKEY POT PIE2 tbsps butter, 1 onion (chopped), 2 stalks celery (chopped), 3 carrots (chopped), 4 tbsps flour, 4 cups chicken or turkey stock, 2 potatoes (peeled and diced), 2 cups shredded turkey, 2 tbsps chopped parsley, 1/2 cup frozen peas (thawed), 1 prepared pie crust, 1 egg (lightly beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Melt butter in a saucepan and cook chopped onion until tender. Stir in celery and carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add potatoes and simmer until tender. Stir in turkey, parsley and peas. Pour mixture into the casserole. Top with pie crust and brush with egg. Bake for 30 minutes until the crust is golden.\nTHANKSGIVING POTATO SKINS6 to 8 small to medium russet potatoes, 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, 1 1/2 cups leftover mashed potatoes, 1 1/2 cup leftover turkey (chopped or shredded), 1 1/2 cups leftover stuffing, 1 cup grated sharp white cheddar, 1/2 cup cranberry sauce.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Scrub potatoes well, then gently pierce with a fork five to six times. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast potatoes until tender and a knife can be inserted without resistance, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool on a baking sheet. Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out potato flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch border; reserve potato flesh for another use. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush inside and outside of potato skins with oil; season with salt. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees. Set a wire rack in a baking sheet. Arrange potato skins skin side down on rack and roast until just beginning to crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly. Layer each potato skin with leftover potatoes, leftover turkey, and leftover stuffing, then top with cheese. Continue to roast until the cheese is melted and the filling is warmed through, about 15 minutes more. Arrange potatoes on a platter. Top with cranberry sauce.\nDEEP FRIED GREEN BEANSToss 1 pound leftover cooked or raw green beans with 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 cup buttermilk. Soak for 15 minutes. Season 1 cup cornmeal with salt and cayenne. Dredge the green beans in the cornmeal, then deep-fry in 2 inches of 375-degree vegetable oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.\nLEFTOVER TURKEY AND STUFFING REUBENS4 tbsps unsalted butter (room temperature), 8 slices rye bread, 4 tbsps Russian dressing, 8 slices Swiss cheese, 2 cups leftover stuffing (warmed slightly), 2 cups sauerkraut, 1 pound leftover thinly sliced turkey, salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPosition a rack about four inches from the broiler heat source and preheat. Line a baking sheet with foil. Spread some butter on one side of each slice of bread. Place four pieces, buttered side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread some of the Russian dressing on the sides facing up. Top each with a slice of cheese and evenly crumble some of the stuffing over the cheese. Top each with some sauerkraut, turkey and then the remaining cheese on top. Put the open-faced sandwiches under the broiler and cook until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the broiler. Spread the rest of the dressing on the uncovered side of the four remaining bread slices, place on top melted cheese and push down, buttered side up to finish the sandwiches. Return to the broiler and toast sandwich, carefully turning once so both sides get nice and golden brown, about 2 minutes total, serve hot.\nGRILLED TURKEY SANDWICH¾ cup mayonnaise, ¼ cup basil pesto, 4-6 slices crusty Italian bread or sourdough, 1/4 cup butter or margarine, 8 or so slices of your baked turkey, artichoke hearts, sliced tomatoes, whatever cheese you like (such as provolone cheese or sliced mozzarella).\nIn a small bowl, mix mayonnaise and pesto. Spread 1 side of each bread slice with butter. Turn bread slices butter sides down; spread other sides with 1 tbsp pesto mixture each. Top eight bread slices with turkey, artichokes, tomatoes and cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, butter sides up. In a sandwich grill or 12-inch skillet, cook sandwiches over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, turning once, until bread is toasted, and cheese is melted.\nTHANKSGIVING LEFTOVER NACHOS1 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp minced chipotle chile in adobo (plus more sauce for serving), 10 cups tortilla chips, 2 cups shredded leftover turkey meat, 3 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, 2 cups thinly sliced leftover cooked Brussels sprouts, 1 1/2 cups leftover cubed roasted butternut squash, 1 cup packaged french-fried onions, 1 cup lightly packed cilantro leaves or parsley leaves, 1/2 cup sliced black olives, 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapenos.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stir the sour cream and chipotle chile together in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wraps and refrigerate. Scatter half the chips on a rimmed baking sheet. Top with one-third of the turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts, butternut squash and fried onions. Scatter the remaining chips on top followed by the remaining two-thirds of turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts and fried onions. Bake until the cheeses are melted and bubbly, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle the nachos with chipotle sour cream and extra adobo sauce. Garnish with cilantro, black olives and jalapenos.\nI'd like to wish everyone a safe, happy and healthy Thanksgiving.\nPlease take the time to check on your shut-in or elderly neighbors as they might not be as fortunate as others. There is nothing that puts a smile on someone's face like a nice big plate of food.\nAs you sit down together at the Thanksgiving dinner table, give thanks for all that we have — no matter how little or much, give thanks to those serving our country at home and abroad, give thanks for anyone working today so others can be home, and bless the hands who prepared your meal.\nSee you next week as we enter December and some amazing Christmas cookie recipes. God bless you all. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

However, the events of the past few days have made it impossible to ignore what is happening in our town.The following is a listing of actions taken by one of the candidates and his supporters that have been embarrassing, juvenile, not how we treat each and, quite frankly, I would never have guessed that these types of behavior would even be thought of in Talbot County.I was first approached the day when first responders were saluted at the Dover Street Memorial. I was told that I should not consider running for the Easton Council president's seat but withdraw and give my personal support to his candidate.I didn't give it anymore attention until a few weeks later a call from his secretary to arrange a meeting.When I went to the meeting, I was surprised that the candidate and another employee were present. A little tacky I thought when the conversation started.You need to withdraw and give your support to my candidate and do it publicly.You cannot win. You have accomplished all you can, and someone with new ideas needs to take over. It was also indicated that I was to old. Stunned, I left the office.Then I see a letter in the Talbot Spy indicating the candidate was furious about the way Easton was being managed. He listed five or six items that to him were damaging and demanding answers. I had lawyers look at the questions and provide answers. All were determined to have been handled appropriately and no further action was necessary.Some of the issues were even brought forth in open session and voted on by the council The candidate included.At this time, the candidate really crossed the line with me. He brought my wife into the picture by complaining about her insurance coverage.For years, the town has included elected officials and spouses on the group Insurance, the candidate included.Then the mailings star, four to date, that really serve no purpose other than to spread misinformation and get people aroused. The person who evidently funds this debacle also mentions my wife by name.I am having a difficult time understanding why so much money is being spent on a position that pays so little money.

Which streamer premieres a brand-new comedy film starring Awkwafina (\"Renfield,\" 2023) and Sandra Oh (\"Grey's Anatomy\") on Friday, Nov. 3? The answer is Hulu, and the film in question is \"Quiz Lady,\" a buddy comedy about two sisters who come together to win a quiz show and save a dog.Awkwafina is Anna, the reliable, type-A sister who is called away from her work as an accountant when her mom's senior living facility reaches out to let Anna know that they had lost her mom - but not to the afterlife.The attendant corrects herself in the trailer, telling Anna, \"Sorry, that was terrible phrasing. I meant we don't know where she is.\" After making it to the facility, Anna is joined by her estranged and distraught sister Jenny, portrayed by Oh, whose purple highlights, oversized sunglasses and flamboyant personal style contrast with Anna's head-to-toe grey wardrobe. Anna is clued in to her mother's whereabouts when a bookie informs her that her beloved pet pug, Mr. Linguini, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage over her mother's massive gambling debts.With the debts creeping up her back and seniors home infractions stacking up, Anna and Jenny's mom flees to Macau, leaving them to sort out what she owes and be reunited with Mr. Linguini. Anna's salary isn't quite generous enough to settle their mother's $80,000 tab, and Jenny's constant search for her latest passion hasn't resulted in financial stability. Two weeks is all they're given to cough up the funds.The siblings are at a loss for ways to get rich quick until Jenny sees Anna participate in her favorite game show, \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" from her sofa. The show is must-watch television for Anna, who tunes in daily, usually accompanied by her canine companion, and effortlessly answers every single question correctly. Seeing Anna in her element turns on a light bulb over Jenny's head.It's decided, then, that the pair will travel to Los Angeles, get Anna on \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" and all their problems will be solved when she wins. Leaving the safety of her routine life in Philadelphia behind, Anna joins Jenny on a wild road trip across the United States and embraces her sister's chaotic, adventurous way of life. Neither of them is completely certain that Anna's trivia skills will transfer from the comfort of her couch to the pressure of the game show's set, but this is the best chance they've got to scrape together enough money to bring Mr. Linguini home unharmed.Having spent years apart, estranged over their differences, Anna and Jenny have a lot of ground to cover - geographically and emotionally - on their road trip. Anna's strictly balanced life greatly differs from her sister Jenny's listless pursuit of purpose. They have things to learn from each other, whether it's how to let loose and go on an adventure or focus enough to successfully achieve a goal.\"The element that really attracted me was the sister dynamic,\" director Jessica Yu told Deadline at the world premiere of \"Quiz Lady\" at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. She added, \"For one thing, I just haven't seen a lot of comedies about sisters, and the fact that at the center of this was two Asian-American sisters, made me think, 'Oh, this will be really fun to explore.'\" \n \n Caption: Sandra Oh and Awkwafina in \"Quiz Lady\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Texas-based company acquired the plant in December 2021.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation called the ruling \"a huge win for clean water and the health of the Chesapeake Bay's tributaries.\"\nChesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland Advocacy Director Alan Girard said Valley Proteins contributes to the nitrogen discharged in the the Transquaking River watershed. He said the original permit didn't ensure the river and Higgins Mill Pond are safe for swimming, fishing and wildlife habitat.\nFriends of the Nanticoke River President Jay Martin said in the news release that his organization is \"encouraged\" by the court's decision.\n\"The court has sent a clear message that we need more comprehensive oversight to ensure our waters are safe and healthy for all species that rely on them,\" he said.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs at ShoreRivers, said the decision \"recognizes the value of clean water.\"\n\"Higgins Mill Pond and the upper Transquaking River are valuable resources that have repeatedly been neglected, and we hope that — through this remand — the state will seek opportunities to meaningfully protect and restore them and reverse the long history of pollution impacts,\" he said in the news release.\nThis is not the only time Valley Proteins has gotten into hot water for its practices.\nIn June, the Maryland Department of the Environment fined Darling Ingredients $15,000 for repeated pollution violations at its Linkwood facility. According to a news release from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, department inspections revealed 51 violations made between August 2023 and March 2024 by the owner of Valley Proteins.\nIn 2022, the facility was put under a consent decree with the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, ShoreRivers and Dorchester Citizens for Planned Growth. The consent degree ordered the facility owners to pay $540,000 in civil penalties to the state for its more than 40 violations of a discharge permit issued by the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Hello Girl’ from Maryland may soon win a medal for her WWI service\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 955\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Marie Edmee LeRoux has been buried at the Fort Lincoln Cemetery here for 79 years, but she may soon win a gold medal for her service in World War I.LeRoux was one of 223 bilingual women deployed to France as telephone operators, often under combat conditions, as part of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. They were the country's first women soldiers, popularly known as the \"Hello Girls.\"\nThey've been long overlooked for their service. But now the U.S. Congress has approved a special congressional gold medal as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for the coming year. The measure now goes to President Joe Biden for consideration.\n\"It's a story that's been forgotten and needs to be told,\" LeRoux's granddaughter, Catherine Bourgin of McLean, Va., said. \"With the passage of the Congressional gold medal, that's what I want.\"\nWomen like LeRoux braved German submarines on the transport to the war front and disease and bombardment to serve in the signal corps under the American Expeditionary Forces. Their service helped set a precedent for women's service in the U.S. military and influenced support for the 19th amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote.\nGen. John Pershing requested that bilingual women operators deploy to France. They were more skilled and experienced at operating the new telephone systems of the time, and the AEF needed bilingual people to communicate with the French forces.\nLeRoux had those skills. She was born in Montreal and grew up speaking French and English before moving to the U.S. at age 10, according to Bourgin. She was a passionate singer but, according to Bourgin, LeRoux abandoned her music career to answer the call.\nLeRoux traveled to France in 1918, operating the switchboards that connected military commanders with the front lines and their French counterparts. She stayed in France after the war to restart her music studies. When war threatened France again in 1939, LeRoux fled the country with her 4-year-old daughter in tow. She eventually came to live near family in Prince George's County.\nShe passed away in 1945 and was interred in an unmarked grave here, according to her granddaughter. She did not receive a military headstone because she was not considered a veteran.\nMany women who served in the U.S. Army signal corps found out they weren't considered \"soldiers\" when they applied for benefits after the war. They received no veteran medical care and no federally funded rehabilitation training.\nThis was only remedied in 1977 when Congress acknowledged them as veterans, following decades of petitioning by Hello Girls like Merle Egan Anderson. Most had already passed away by then.\nWhile Bourgin was researching her grandmother's history, she discovered LeRoux was a member of the Hello Girls. She also learned that a congressional commission had recommended these female veterans receive a Congressional Gold Medal collectively.\nSo, in 2023, Bourgin began working with others to help her grandmother and the other Hello Girls get that medal.\nBourgin refers to the advocacy group as the \"Hello Girls Family,\" and she joined them to bring their story to Capitol Hill. Elizabeth Cobbs' 2017 book also helped reintroduce the women operators' war contribution into the mainstream.\n\"The telephone,\" Cobbs said, \"was the only way that they could rapidly communicate with troops who were facing mechanized onslaughts of the most destructive machinery ever devised by humans.\"\nWomen could operate the war switchboards faster than their male counterparts, she said. They couldn't even vote at the time, nor serve on juries in most states.\nChris Christopher led the advocacy charge.\nAs a former staffer on the World War I Centennial Commission that recommended in 2018 that the Hello Girls receive the award as part of the country's formal efforts to commemorate the war, Christopher thought getting the award across the finish line was important. In 2023, with no bill passed, Christopher decided to tackle the issue head-on.\n\"I sat down,\" Christopher said, \"and wrote a letter to every single senator who was not already a co-sponsor.\"\nIf a senator was not a co-sponsor, Christopher said, he researched and included World War I registration documents of a relative or ancestor of that senator to personalize the letters. He then made sure those were hand-delivered to the senators.\nVolunteering in his free time, he also coordinated the network of history buffs and Hello Girl descendants and supporters for virtual meetings and lobbying on the Hill.\nCatherine Bourgin had just discovered her grandmother's unmarked grave in Fort Lincoln Cemetery, in a plot next to her great-grandmother's. She also connected with Christopher at the same time.\nBourgin said her grandmother's grave was symbolic of what happened to the Hello Girls. LeRoux was in an unmarked grave, Bourgin said, just miles from the nation's capital but nevertheless lost to history.\nWhile lobbying on Capitol Hill a few months later, Bourgin said, she told other advocates about the unmarked grave. The group got fired up, she said, and decided to change that.\nThey procured the grave marker and arranged for a military honors ceremony at the cemetery.\n\"The folks that did what they did for my grandmother,\" Bourgin said, \"they truly made an indelible mark on my family's history.\"\nBourgin thinks the ceremony drew attention to the gold-medal cause. They made sure members of Congress were invited.\nNow it seems the advocacy may have worked. Senators are expected to take up the defense act in the coming days.\nBoth Bourgin and Christopher hope that the award will bring attention to the untold stories of the country's first female soldiers, and ensure that all of them have veteran's grave markers.\n\"There are so many stories out there like this,\" Bourgin said, \"and we just have to discover them.\"\n\"Hopefully once we get past all this, this is going to be something that will generate an ongoing effort,\" Christopher said. He wants \"to get all of the Hello Girls their appropriate grave marker.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bay Bridge traffic situation only getting worse\n\n July 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MICHAEL SAKATA | Section: Columns \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Weekends are no longer sustainable on the Eastern Shore. Nor, for that matter, are most weekdays.The 16-mile traffic backups that paralyzed Maryland's Mid-Shore and Upper Shore on July 6, as thousands of weary families spent the waning hours of their holiday weekends languishing on westbound U.S. 50, were unsurprising to those who cross the Bay Bridge and travel this corridor on a regular basis. To their credit, our state and local leaders have used every available Band-Aid to mitigate this crisis — from eliminating the outdated booths at the Bay Bridge's eastbound toll plaza, to closing westbound access roads to weekend through traffic.\nDespite their best efforts, though, the situation will only get worse.\nAs the population of the Eastern Shore continues to climb, regional policymakers work to expand housing inventories in order to meet demand, and the Shore becomes an increasingly popular destination for year-round entertainment and tourism, congestion will only intensify. There will, inevitably, come a time when backups of this magnitude are a daily occurrence and Shore residents are effectively cut off from jobs, emergency services and one another.\nGiven the inevitability of these trends, and the amount of time it takes for transportation projects to be funded and built in the state of Maryland, we must recognize that the time for action is now. By waiting any longer to commit to a visionary transportation mobility plan, we will only put these Marylanders' lives, livelihoods and quality of life at severe risk.\nGiven the stakes, Gov. Moore and the Maryland General Assembly are to be commended for committing an additional $500 million to some of our state's most urgent projects this past legislative session. This was a vital first step, but with more than $3 billion in unsatisfied priorities and a statewide network of roads, highways and bridges that continue to crumble with age, it is now time to take a quantum leap forward.\nThe Maryland Transportation Builders & Materials Association, which represents roughly 240 businesses (and therefore over 100,000 Maryland employees) across the DMV region, has developed a comprehensive regional approach to the U.S. 50 congestion crisis. An approach that recognizes this situation is much bigger than any single project and, therefore, addresses the challenge at multiple chokepoints and safety hazards.\nSpecifically, our plan calls upon our state leaders to wrap up what has been an interminable Chesapeake Bay Bridge Crossing Study, determine the best strategy for adding significant lane capacity and begin the arduous process of securing the massive funding that will be necessary to move the project forward. We do so, however, knowing that expanded Bay Bridge capacity alone will not solve the problem entirely.\nTherefore, we are also calling for action on the following projects — all of which are in the Maryland Department of Transportation's six-year program — and are highlighted in our \"25 for 25\" campaign. These projects will help our state to meet the demands of the mid-21st century and beyond:\nConstruction of a grade-separated interchange at U.S. Route 50 and 213 in Wye Mills.Safety improvements at the highly perilous intersection of U.S. 50 and the Easton Bypass.Widening of I-97 to six lanes between U.S. Route 50 and state Route 32.Addition of lane capacity at U.S. Route 50 and Ritchie Highway.Capacity, safety and functionality improvements along the state Route 90 corridor, from U.S. 50 to Coastal Highway.Replacement of the unreliable Sinepuxent Bay drawbridge at the Ocean City Inlet.\nTo be sure, this is an ambitious plan. In fact, likely the most thorough reimagining of the Eastern Shore's transportation capacity since the \"Reach the Beach\" program nearly 40 years ago. It is also an expensive ask at a time when our primary sources of transportation revenue are plummeting due to improved gas mileage, reduction in gasoline-powered automobiles and various economic pressures.\nHowever, to suggest that these projects simply cannot be done would imply that they are merely a luxury and not a necessity. As the primary voice of Maryland's transportation industry, we believe that failure to act is no longer an acceptable option. Even in the face of unprecedented fiscal and economic challenges, our elected officials and business leaders must come together — absent the partisan and geographic rivalries that so often act as impediments to progress — and determine how, and not if, we will make this vision a reality.\nWe simply cannot continue to live like this. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man urges water caution after 'flesh-eating bacteria' infection\n\n September 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 942\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Facing a life-altering bacterial infection from the local river, a local couple is urging the community to be more informed swimmers.A typical day at the shore turned a couple's lives upside down after a sharp step opened a wound on a man's leg and exposed him to bacteria in the Chester River last summer.\nFor over a year, Kyle \"Slade\" Register, of Cambridge has been fighting Vibrio, a \"flesh-eating\" bacteria found in local rivers.\nRegister and Audra Williamson were swimming in the Chester River on Aug. 16, 2024 when Register stepped on what they presume was a sharp oyster shell and cut a small, deep gash on the inside of Register's left foot. The couple quickly went to work cleaning the wound with peroxide and rubbing alcohol and scrubbed it with antibacterial soap before wrapping it.\nGoing to bed as normal, \"We never dreamt we would wake up the next morning to his foot being the size of a bowling pin with a red streak starting up his leg,\" Williamson said.\nRegister spent a week at the hospital in Easton before being transferred to University of Maryland Shock Trauma, where he stayed for the following month. While there, Register had four surgeries to save his leg.\n\"It's been a year, and he is still going to wound care twice a week,\" Williamson said.\nRegister is unable to work full-time with the wound, as the two-inch gash ended in the entire inside of his left calf and the inside of his left foot being cut out, with a wound vac attached for months.\nThe couple went from having a \"pretty normal life,\" to losing work and having their lives turned upside down, Williamson said.\nNow beginning to get back on their feet, the two are sharing their story as a precautionary tale to others taking a dip.\n\"We just want to prevent this from happening to others,\" Williamson said.\nAccording to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, Vibrio are naturally occurring bacteria found in brackish environments like the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, such as the Chester River. In rare cases, swimmers can develop illnesses or infections if an open wound is exposed to polluted water.\nA \"tough construction worker type,\" who never thought twice about what was hidden in waterways, Register said his entire view of the water changed after that incident.\nA \"fish,\" all his life, Register now looks at the water with \"abject sadness.\"\nTaking it one day at a time, the Cambridge couple still drive around the Chesapeake Bay, estuaries, and areas like Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge to look at the water \"but I don't go in,\" Register said.\nLooking back on the treatment and recovery he has faced and the journey still to come, \"I don't want a parent to feel that pain,\" Register said and seeks to share his story with others.\nNot to scare people, but to help them understand the possibilities, Register said. \"The public needs to be more educated about this,\" he said.\nWilliamson encouraged checking out the local environmental organizations information and the EPA website before swimming or boating.\nRegister welcomes the opportunities to share his story and can be reached at sladeregister81@gmail.com.\nAccording to Shorerivers' Swimmable ShoreRivers Bacteria Monitoring Program Report, \"Is it safe to swim in the river?\" is one of the most common questions Riverkeepers hear from community members. There are inherent risks with coming in contact with water in a living estuary, and ShoreRivers works to understand the bacterial levels associated with enterococci, an EPA recommended indicator for human health risks.\nEnterococci includes more than 17 species of fecal bacteria and is found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. High levels of enterococci can indicate elevated risks for human contact with pathogens and other bacteria, such as E-coli. While there are natural bacteria levels in local rivers due to wildlife and decomposition, there are also pollution sources such as failing septic systems and faulty sewer lines, pet waste, mishandling of boat waste, and some organic fertilizers that can pose threats to human health.\n\"There are additional risks with open water swimming that we do not regularly monitor, including vibrio, toxic algal blooms, and other biological and chemical toxins,\" according to the report.\nShoreRivers' seasonal bacteria monitoring program regularly monitors nearly 50 sites where people frequently come in contact with water, including popular swimming locations, marinas, yacht clubs, and towns. Swim Tester volunteers collect water samples every Thursday morning from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Riverkeepers then analyze the samples and distribute data on bacteria levels in the river, aiming to provide the public with the information needed to make educated decisions about their contact with the water.\nThe Swimmable ShoreRivers program utilizes the standardized EPA criteria for recreational swimming of 104 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/100ml for analyzing a single bacteria sample. Anything equal to or higher than 104 CFU is a failing sample, and anything below 104 CFU is a passing sample. Not all test sites are designated swimming areas.\nAccording to Shore Rivers, bacteria levels can change, particularly as a result of significant rain events.\nShoreRivers always recommends following best practices when recreating in local waterways including rinsing off after swimming, avoiding swimming for 24–48 hours after a rain event, and staying out of the water with open cuts or wounds to minimize exposure to potentially harmful bacteria.\nAs part of its ongoing work to protect and restore local rivers and creeks, ShoreRivers weekly bacteria monitoring reports are posted every Friday from Memorial Day to Labor Day at www.shorerivers.org/swim.\nThough the seasonal Swimmable ShoreRivers testing has wrapped up for this year, a full report on each regularly monitored site is expected in October.\nInformation on how to prevent and respond to possible infections, can be found in the Maryland Department of the Environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "GOP not there yet with articles of impeachment\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Byron York | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 782\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There's a lot of talk among House Republicans about impeaching President Joe Biden. But GOP members disagree on whether there is enough evidence to go forward.On one hand, Republican investigators have made enormous progress in the past few weeks. The testimony of former Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer demolished Joe Biden's claim that he didn't talk to his son about Hunter's shady foreign business deals.GOP lawmakers are also finding increasing evidence that foreign money flowed to multiple members of the Biden family close to Joe Biden himself.\"We have caught Joe Biden in so many lies,\" House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer told Fox News recently. \"I can't even count the number of lies now. So we have put together a case that I think would stand up in any court of law in America.\" Of course, no one is talking about criminal charges against the sitting president of the United States. Rather, if Republicans were to take action against Biden, it would be through impeachment.GOP House members have filed several resolutions of impeachment against Biden. Now there is a new one, the first since the Archer testimony, from a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube. The resolution, containing four articles of impeachment, shows why the effort to impeach Biden is just not there yet.Article One attempts to link Joe Biden to Hunter Biden's, and brother James Biden's, influence peddling operations.The article says Hunter and James Biden \"sold access\" to then Vice President Joe Biden and then \"sold promised access\" to Joe Biden before he became president.Joe Biden himself \"assisted by making appearances, phone calls, meeting with business partners, and knowingly allowing his family members to promise access to him and actions by him in furtherance of these schemes.\" The Biden family, the article says, benefited financially from that; Joe Biden's role was an \"abuse of power\" and a violation of federal law.Article Two accuses Joe Biden of obstruction of justice, charging that the Biden Justice Department interfered with investigations into Hunter Biden's activities. The accusations are taken from two IRS whistleblowers who have outlined in detail how DOJ dragged its feet and actually blocked IRS investigators from looking into what appeared to be clear tax evasion by Hunter Biden.\"These acts constitute an abuse of power as well as obstruction of justice,\" the article says.Article Three accuses Joe Biden of fraud for a matter in which James Biden allegedly deceived investors in a health care company. \"Access to Joe Biden and indications that Joe Biden supported these schemes were used to lure investors into the schemes,\" the article says.Finally, Article Four accuses Joe Biden of \"financial involvement in drug and prostitution activities.\" The article says Joe Biden and Hunter Biden \"have a long history of comingled and intertwined finances.\" During the 2010s, Hunter Biden was famously blowing millions of dollars on drugs and prostitutes, both of which are illegal.\"Given the intermingled finances of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, Joe Biden financially supported and should have been aware of these drug transactions and prostitution transactions,\" the article says. \"Many of these transactions would have occurred using accounts with a nexus to Joe Biden.\" So that is the current case against Joe Biden. The obvious weakness in all the articles is that they are based on an effort to tie Joe Biden to Hunter Biden's, or James Biden's, allegedly illegal activities. Republicans have made great progress in beginning to discover such links. They have shown that Joe Biden lied about his knowledge of Hunter's activities, which is an important breakthrough. There appears to be much left to be discovered.In addition, Republican have convincingly established that the Biden administration improperly interfered with investigation of Hunter Biden's activities. That is an important breakthrough, too, although there is much more to learn.So as far as the first two articles are concerned, there is good reason for Republicans to push forward with their investigation. The third article, about James Biden, is very iffy, and the fourth article, about Joe Biden's knowledge of Hunter's drugging and whoring, will never go anywhere.And that is the current state of efforts to impeach Joe Biden. Republicans do not yet have a convincing case for impeachment. Maybe they will get there, and maybe they won't. As far as exercising general restraint against taking the extreme measure of impeachment is concerned - well, that sort of restraint went out with Nancy Pelosi's leadership of the House. If Republicans do eventually gather enough evidence against Biden, they'll use it. But they don't have it yet.Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.COPYRIGHT 2023BYRON YORKDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEELSYNDICA TION \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Two more Santa's Workshop in the Land of Misfits Saturdays are scheduled: Dec. 14 and Dec. 21 from noon to 4 p.m.\nCaroline County Council of Arts Executive Director George Karos said the event is a \"fun way to celebrate the holidays.\"\n\"Everyone can make art and spend time with loved ones — especially a win-win as proceeds go towards supporting local youth programs and spreading holiday cheer,\" Karos said in an emailed statement.\nMegan Krizovensky, program manager for Caroline County Council of Arts, said in an interview that last weekend's event was a success. It's the first time the art organization put on Santa's Workshop.\n\"It was pretty good,\" Krizovenksy said of Saturday's turnout. \"I know the first week we expected to be a little slower. But we actually had at least 50 children there, and we were prepared for over 100. So we're hoping that (Dec. 14 and Dec. 21) can pick it up much bigger just for the kid's sake.\"\nLast Saturday, the Chesapeake Culinary Center participated in the event and donated cookies and cocoa. Krizovenksy said Earth Tones Cafe will be donating food for this Saturday.\nAdditionally, students from Caroline County Public Schools are volunteering, gaining student service learning hours. The first-time event runs fully on donations, Krizovenksy added.\n\"The event is completely donation-based with all proceeds going to support local youth programs through the Caroline County Council of Arts,\" she said.\nKrizovensky said local artist Steve Mead, formerly the board treasurer for the arts council, was integral in the event's formulation.\nThe hope is that Santa's Workshop can continue in the future, with some of this year's proceeds working to fund a second annual Santa's Workshop. Registration is free with a suggested donation of $15 per child.\n\"The goal is to create a magical experience for kids who otherwise might not have a great holiday,\" Krizovenksy said. \"We want to make sure that it's free. Our mission is to enrich the community through the arts, and Caroline County itself is a unique place anyway with a lot of deep-rooted tradition. So we're trying to create authentic experiences that reflect and celebrate the spirit of that community.\"\nTo register for Dec. 14 or Dec. 21, sign up at carolinearts.org/events/santas-workshop-in-the-island-of-misfit-toys/ or visit The Foundry Art Gallery at 401 Market St. in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One day, you can tell your grandchildren you were alive to witness this completely pointless bit of history.Rep. Matt Gaetz's (R-Fla.) self-aggrandizing political stunt makes no sense and changes nothing - other than perhaps his fundraising totals.And other than some platitudinous blathering about \"the establishment\" and \"the uniparty,\" I still haven't seen anyone offer a coherent reason - not even retroactively - for how any of this is the \"best way to advance the conservative agenda.\" It would be one thing, perhaps an admirable thing, if Gaetz had gone on this crusade for a coherent ideological or principled reason. But his post-ousting demagoguery and grandstanding about issues completely unrelated to McCarthy's job performance proved it was a personal matter.\"I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos,\" Gaetz explained.\"I think $33 trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos.\" Now, there are numerous people to blame for the impending fiscal disaster, but McCarthy is no more guilty than most.One of the least convincing claims by Gaetz's defenders is that McCarthy was punished for ignoring the base. \"The base,\" of course, is a popular euphemism for the most vociferous populist faction of the GOP.This faction enjoys blowing things up - mostly their own party's prospects. In this case, the \"base\" was represented by eight Republicans and the entire Democratic Party.And among these principled eight GOPers who were fighting for the honor of the base - what The New York Times called the \"far-right GOP faction\" - were Reps.Nancy Mace (who said Gaetz was a \"fraud\" the last time he tried to knock off McCarthy) and Ken Buck (who we last heard was reportedly looking for a CNN gig). I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the future of conservatism was not the motivating factor for their votes.Most Trump-endorsed candidates didn't even participate in McCarthy's removal. Donald Trump himself tepidly supported the speaker because, as he noted, the man had said \"very great things\" about him. And, really, what's more important? Though, I bet McCarthy was expecting a far more energetic defense after pathetically ingratiating himself to the former president a couple of weeks ago.Even if Gaetz had excellent reasons, Republicans did not eject McCarthy.Eight Republicans can't do anything by themselves. No, 208 Democrats ousted McCarthy with the help of some petulant backbenchers nursing personal vendettas. It is a political coup for the Dems.Gaetz, who only yesterday was going on about McCarthy's \"secret deal\" with Democrats, had no qualms sitting on the opposition side of the House plotting to oust a speaker who holds a rickety nine-seat majority. If there was actually a brewing House rebellion, Gaetz would have been able to corral far more votes.But Gaetz wanted to \"break the fever\" of D.C., so he teamed up with minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, \"the squad,\" Adam Schiff and so on. Jeffries claimed he was supporting Gaetz's efforts because Republicans have shown an \"unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner.\" The notion that Democrats are backing a leading MAGA loyalist because they want to temper the \"extremism\" of Republicans makes about as much sense as Jamaal Bowman's fire alarm story. Democrats keep pretending they yearn for a more responsible GOP and stable political environment, then keep supporting every fringe effort and candidate to undermine both.Of course, no one is owed anything.McCarthy isn't the only person available in D.C. to serve as a middling speaker of the House. And, frankly, if he'd been more talented at the job, he might have headed off this challenge more effectively. But it's doubtful anyone is going to perform better with a slender majority and the Senate and presidency in Democrats' hands.But then again, none of that matters when you're having a tantrum. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Residents can vote at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department on Leonard Rieck Drive from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.The council is made up of a president along with four representatives from the town's election wards.\nFor the council president seat, incumbent Frank Gunsallus and current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello will square off. Gunsallus has served as Town Council president since September 2023. Abbatiello has represented Ward 2 on the council since 2019.\nWith Abbatiello opting to run for president, a new resident will assume the Ward 2 seat. In that race, Lynnette Keefe and Robert Rankin will face off. Ward 2 includes a large portion of town east of U.S. Route 50 and north of Dutchman's Lane, as well as residents on the west side of the highway, south of Idlewild Avenue and east of Route 322.\nThe Ward 4 race will present voters with three options: incumbent the Rev. Elmer Davis, who has served in the seat since 2020; Moonyene Jackson-Amis, previously Ward 4's representative from 2001 to 2008; and Cameron Keefe. Ward 4 encompasses much of Easton's downtown area in between Routes 50 and 322, including residents north of Idlewild Avenue and on the east side of Aurora Street up past Dover Road.\nThe Star Democrat sent a questionnaire to all candidates running in the May 6 election to allow them to share their perspectives on various town issues in their own words.\nToday's paper features the responses from the candidates for the Ward 2 race. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My neighbor, a gentleman in his 50s, saw me smoking a cigarette the other day and decided to take it upon himself to lecture me on the dangers of smoking.Although I appreciated his concern, his lecture was unwelcome. I intend to quit smoking at some point, but I don't need my neighbor to intervene. I fear that the next time I bump into him, he will give me another lecture. What can I do to make him understand that his unsolicited advice is not helping? I'm a grown adult, and I don't need lectures. - Good IntentionsDEAR GOOD INTENTIONS: As you know, your neighbor expressed his concerns out of genuine care for you. Remember that when you speak to him. It is your right to do whatever you want with your life and your body. Provided that the cigarette smoke is not contaminating your neighbors' air, you should be able to smoke in peace.That said, it is likely that this man will either say something or scowl at you the next time he sees a cigarette in your hand. Can you say something?Yes, but be careful. You can thank him for his concern, but put up a guardrail. Tell him you know what you are doing. When you decide to quit, you will. Politely ask him to refrain from giving you advice on this topic in the future.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist andfounder of Dream Leapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "Federalsburg unveils sign to recognize historic 2023 election, people who made it possible\n\n November 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 744\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — The Rev. Jeffrey Butler, a Federalsburg resident, remembers when Brooklyn Avenue went from being a dirt road to a paved one in the late 1970s. He also remembers the more than 40 years it took for the town to get that road repaved.\"It was so bad,\" he said. \"I mean, just tearing cars up. And we went to the town to complain. They still didn't do nothing.\"\n\"Finally, along with this lawsuit, came them also fixing this road up after 40 years,\" Butler said.\nSince a lawsuit led to the election of the town's first two Black council members last year, the road — which is situated in a historically Black area in town — has been repaved.\nOn Saturday, with the newly paved Brooklyn Avenue in view, Federalsburg Mayor Kim Abner and the Federalsburg Town Council unveiled a new sign that commemorates the town's historic election and the new election system that made it possible.\nThe sign recognizes the individuals and groups who helped make it possible for Black Councilwomen Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James to be elected to the Town Council in September 2023.\nA MARKER OF PROGRESSAfter the unveiling, Hammond looked at the sign, tears forming in her eyes.\n\"It's a lot,\" she said, taking a pause, \"to think that this small little town was able to stand for the rights of all people, not some people.\"\nHammond, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town, said the progress that has been made in the town is \"heartwarming\" and \"breathtaking.\"\n\"It's a dream come true for me and for others that (came) before me, that we have established that everybody should be represented no matter what the color of your skin is,\" she said.\nAlthough Black residents now make up nearly half of the town's population, the town had never had a minority representative on the council in its 200-year history. In June 2023 — through charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings — the town's at-large election system was changed to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.\nIn April, a $260,000 settlement was reached in the lawsuit filed against the town by the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and Federalsburg residents regarding its discriminatory election system.\nThe settlement included a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after the town's previous election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives. This includes the town apologizing to those who brought on the lawsuit, affixing a plaque to its town hall building, proclaiming Sept. 26 as Voting Rights Day and erecting the historical marker in the town's Black community.\nHammond said this sign unveiling and the first annual Voting Rights Day celebration, which was held in September, point to \"a new era\" in Federalsburg.\n\"It is a new era where everybody has a voice and everybody will be heard,\" she said.\nAfter years of Butler speaking out about the need for Brooklyn Avenue to be repaved, Hammond said the new council was able to get the project done in about a year.\nBefore the sign was unveiled, Mayor Kim Abner said she and the council are excited about the direction that Federalsburg is going in.\n\"We have great things to come,\" she said. \"We are making great progress in the town, and we are super excited that you're all here to celebrate.\"\nButler said he is hopeful more positive changes are coming with the current council in place.\n\"It's coming,\" he said. \"We know Rome wasn't built in a day, so it's coming.\"\nSherone Lewis, a Federalsburg native and first vice president for the Caroline County branch of the NAACP who was a plaintiff on the lawsuit, called it surreal to be celebrating the changes that have been made.\n\"But I must say, the struggle continues,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do for diversity, equity and inclusion. I know those are buzz words these days. But I do believe that because I want this for my children, my grandchildren.\"\nWillie Woods, president of the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, said the new sign is something that will be seen and read for generations.\n\"I hate to talk about it from this standpoint, but in the future, we will be passed on and there will be other generations,\" she said. \"And this signage will remind them of the stance that was taken and of the progress that Federalsburg has embraced as we are moving forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our family will miss him. But I know he's in a better place,\" Ronald Isley said in a statement released Thursday by an Isley Brothers publicist.Further details were not immediately available.A Cincinnati native, Rudolph Isley began singing in church with brothers Ronald and O'Kelly (another sibling, Vernon, died at age 13) and was still in his teens when they broke through in the late 1950s with \"Shout,\" a secularized gospel rave that was later immortalized during the toga party scene in \"Animal House.\" The Isleys scored again in the early 1960s with the equally spirited \"Twist and Shout,\" which the Beatles liked so much they used it as the closing song on their debut album and opened with it for their famed 1965 concert at Shea Stadium.The Isleys' other hits included \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),\" later covered by Rod Stewart, and the Grammy-winning \"It's Your Thing.\" In the 1970s, after younger brother Ernest and Marvin joined the group, they had even greater success with such singles as \"That Lady\" and \"Fight the Power (Part 1)\" and such million-selling albums as \"The Heat Is On\" and \"Go for Your Guns.\" Rudolph Isley left the group in 1989, three years after the sudden death of O'Kelly Isley, to become a Christian minister. He was among the Isleys inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

These sensitivities are rich. You don't own Christ's image. And you can't use the political process to impose your brand of Christian beliefs on the public and expect others not to see it as fair game for cartoonists.As a born-again Christian, I felt called to run for state Senate in 2018. Matthew 25 was my platform where Jesus says whatever you do for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, those needing clothes, the sick and those in prison you do for Me.I was at my beautiful church, New St. John's in Wittman, and was called up at the last minute to read the new testament scripture and the lectionary reading happened to include that portion of Matthew 25.That settled the debate in my head about whether to run.Before I moved to the Eastern Shore in 2010, a friend and I had a nursing home ministry where we would visit six nursing homes to conduct worship and prayer services.Since coming here, I had a worship service in the Alzheimer's unit at the Pines for four years. I studied a year of clinical pastoral education and served as an on-call chaplain at the Easton Hospital.Today I visit the women in the Talbot County Detention Center.The shame today, of course, is that one party has been wrapping itself in the cloak of Christianity for the past decade, insisting our pluralistic country is a Christian country and promoting policies that exclude the LGBTQ+ community.They even insisted that restricting gatherings including church attendance during the early days of the pandemic was anti-Christian.Their efforts to impose an abortion ban is organized around certain faith-based communities.Our beautiful country is a pluralistic one.Churches, synagogues and mosques are simply human institutions and churches in particular have shrinking attendance. These Christians should develop a sense of humor and recognize that they can't play in the public square and not expect to be called out for it.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Police Accountability Board reports progress\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1030\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Caroline County Police Accountability Board shared its second annual report with the County Commissioners at their Feb. 6 meeting.The bottom line: Of the thousands of contacts people had with county and town law enforcement officers, a handful of complaints were made, and a fraction of those resulted in disciplinary action.\nPresenting the report were Police Accountability Board Chairman John Bartlett and Board Administrator Kimberly Raeder.\nBartlett said he wanted to make one \"very important\" point: The Caroline County Sheriff's Office had over 26,000 calls for service in 2023, which generated only six complaints, he said.\n\"Five of those six were exonerated, meaning unfounded, and one was a very minor infraction, which led to a written reprimand,\" he said. \"I think that speaks volumes with law enforcement here in Caroline County.\"\nA state mandate\nRaeder explained the purpose and scope of the three police oversight boards mandated by the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021, which became effective July 1, 2022.\nThe role of the county's Police Accountability Board \"is to receive police complaints, recommend policy changes and identify any trends,\" Raeder said.\n\"The second board is the five-member Administrative Charging Committee, and their role is to look over and review completed complaint investigations and recommend discipline,\" she said. If the Charging Committee decides to administratively charge, they use the statewide police disciplinary matrix to \"decide what kind of discipline would be necessary based on the complaint.\"\nThe five members of the Charging Committee were appointed and trained in April 2023 at the Fretterd Center by the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission.\nThe third board is the Trial Board comprised of retired Maryland Circuit Court Judge Owen Wise, a citizen and a police officer of the same rank, Raeder said. No complaints have been referred to this board.\n\"I'm proud to say that Caroline County is leading the way for other counties on the Eastern Shore who have reached out to us regarding using Judge Wise, if they need a judge for a trial board,\" she said.\nFew complaints filed\nAmong the county's municipalities, 15 complaints were filed, including a pending complaint related to an April 7, 2023, incident in Denton that prompted millions of views on YouTube, Bartlett said.\nA video of the incident shows Christopher Morgan threatening the residents and breaking the window of the storm door of a home while two Denton Police officers stand on the sidewalk watching.\nThe way the officers handled the call for service prompted Denton Police Chief George Bacorn to request the Talbot County Sheriff's Office to investigate the handling of the incident. Their findings were turned over to the Administrative Charging Committee.\nThere were no complaints from Ridgely or Greensboro. One was brought to the Police Accountability Board from Federalsburg, which was exonerated, Bartlett said.\nThe report breaks down the 15 complaints by percentages; numerically, four complaints are pending investigation, three were administratively charged, two were withdrawn by the complainant, four were exonerated and two were \"not in the purview of the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee).\"\nThe Accountability Board identified trends in the disciplinary process and didn't \"recommend any changes at this time.\"\n\"A common identified trend, however, has been the lack of activation of body cameras when officers interact with the public,\" the report stated. \"The ACC discovered this trend when reviewing completed complaint investigations which had no body camera footage for the ACC to review. The Board advised the municipal Police Departments and the Sheriff's Office to remind Officers to adhere to department policy and activate their cameras when encountering the public. The policy protects both the Officer and the Citizen if a complaint were to arise from the interaction.\"\nCost to the county\nBartlett thanked the commissioners for their \"financial support of the committee for legal decisions when needed.\"\nThe boards' complying with the state mandates has incurred expenses for the county, although some have been covered by the Police Accountability, Community, and Transparency Grant program.\nOf the $105,272 in grant funds received, the Accountability Board has spent $49,545, which includes the purchase of IAPro software for filing complaints, annual computer licensing for all board members, and pay for the Board's administrator.\nThe Police Accountability Board is asking the state to continue offering these grants, as well as other police-oriented grant programs for local police departments to be able to purchase \"the required technology, resources, and tools to comply with the law,\" including software and a change in the vendor for body cameras, so that every law enforcement agency in the county has the same system.\nOther costs included outside legal counsel, with expenses the County Commissioners agreed to fund to the tune of nearly $8,000.\nQuestions arose requiring legal clarification for both the Police Accountability Board and Administrative Charging Committee, and the county commissioners \"agreed to bear the expense of hiring outside legal counsel\" to represent both. \"Legal Counsel attends each quarterly meeting and provides interpretation of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021 as needed,\" the report stated.\nThe legal expenses for the Police Accountability Board were $3,650, while those of the Administrative Charging Committee amounted to $4,300.\nPAB recommendations\nThe Accountability Board recommends \"changing ACC training from all in-person training to online meeting based or pre-recorded online training. With one member of our ACC board resigning this past July, we have firsthand knowledge of the burden imposed on the newly appointed volunteer Board member. As terms end or resignations occur, the pool of applicants will continue to shrink when advised that members must undergo uncompensated training prior to serving.\"\nAnother unanticipated result of the law has been the withdrawing of multiple complaints, which created a legal conundrum for the Accountability Board and is currently being resolved with the Office of the Attorney General.\nThe report also suggested amending the law by mandating only complaints of \"matters of public concern,\" that is, \"police misconduct, such as abuse of power, false arrest, police brutality, or criminal activity\" be referred to the Charging Committee, thus alleviating pressure on municipal police departments. \"Rude and discourteous\" behavior towards a citizen would be handled at the department or agency level, as suggested by the Accountability Board.\nTo read the full report, which includes rosters of members of the PAB and ACC boards, visit carolinemd.org/DocumentCenter/View/8606/2023-Annual-Report-PAB?bidId=.

    "content": "Sail Selina II to set sail in St. Michaels for final season\n\n April 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 661\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — After nearly a century on the water and more than two decades guiding passengers along the Miles River, the Sail Selina II will be sailing into retirement later this year.Following its upcoming season, which begins next week, Captain Iris Robertson will be retiring. But before it departs the Bay following the end of its season in November, Sail Selina II is going out with a bang.\nThe boat is joining the National Park Service's Chesapeake Gateways Network, a network of places that offer opportunities for visitors to learn about and enjoy the Chesapeake Bay.\nRobertson said in the last 25 years, she estimates close to 60,000 people have stepped aboard Sail Selina II. Some of those passengers, she said, might not have gotten out on the water otherwise.\n\"The Bay is very fragile,\" Robertson said. \"It's at risk right now. And (for) folks that live in Pennsylvania, (it's) out of sight, out of mind. But they're on the watershed. And Selina's just been a wonderful way for people to connect to something that they participate in even though it's not necessarily in their backyard.\"\nOn April 24, there will be a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Harbour Inn Marina in St. Michaels to welcome Sail Selina II into the Chesapeake Gateways Network for its final season. The event will include remarks from National Park Service Chesapeake Gateways Superintendent Wendy O'Sullivan.\nGENERATIONS ON THE WATERAlthough Robertson, who lives in Royal Oak, has been the captain of Sail Selina II for 25 years, her history with the boat stretches back to before she was born.\nIn 1926, Robertson's grandfather had the boat commissioned. Her grandparents kept the boat for 36 years before passing it down to Robertson's parents in 1962. In 2001, Robertson became Sail Selina II's third steward.\n\"From the time I was about 12, even though I've got older siblings, everybody knew she would come to me,\" Robertson said. \"I was the kid that was aboard, participating, had the interest.\"\nRobertson made the decision to charter the boat so that she could afford to maintain it.\nAfter Sail Selina II's final charter season, Robertson plans to pass the yacht down to her niece, who happens to live in Greenport, New York, where Sail Selina II was built.\n\"It's like a full-circle thing,\" Robertson said about the sailing yacht. \"She's 100 years old. She's going back to the town she was built in.\"\nRobertson said she knows her grandparents and father, who have since died, would be so proud of the boat's Chesapeake Gateways designation.\n\"I think they'd be tickled pink to know how much she has contributed to people's joy and experience over the last 25 years,\" Robertson said.\nSTEPPING ABOARDWith a 1,000-square-foot canvas sail, the 44-foot-long Sail Selina II is a \"stable\" and \"regal\" sailing yacht, Robertson said.\n\"We have a lot of guests that have never been on boats before, and they're a little bit nervous when they first step on,\" she said. \"But by the time they get off, they go, 'Oh my God, this was like being on a flying magic carpet ride.'\"\nFrom wine and beer tasting cruises, to sunset sails, to engagement cruises, to weddings, to private sailing lessons, there are many options for those who want to set sail on Sail Selina II. Robertson said the standard two-hour tour takes passengers around St. Michaels Harbor before cruising out to the Miles River and putting up sails.\n\"We let the wind determine our course,\" Robertson said. \"And before you know it, two hours has gone by.\"\nRepeat passenger Gene Pisasale said he and his wife love sailing on Sail Selina II because they love being out on the water and they love sailing with Robertson.\n\"She's got to be the friendliest boat captain on the Chesapeake,\" said Pisasale, who lives in Pennsylvania. \"And she is just a gem, a real gem. A pleasure to sail with.\"\nTo charter Sail Selina II during its last season, visit sailselina.com/ or call 410-726-9400. The season will go from April 18 through Nov. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "title": "An Italian seafood Christmas feast",
    "date": "2023-12-20",

    "content": "An Italian seafood Christmas feast\n\n December 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; Country Cooking | Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 1407\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently I attended a luncheon that featured mainly Italian dishes, and I was very impressed with both the number of dishes featured and that you could tell they were a labor of love. Especially my favorite - spaghetti and meatballs!My memory went back to my late Italian friend who served Italian Christmas dinners each year in honor of her Italian ancestry. So, I decided to do an Italian dinner this year in memory of my late friend.\nIn future columns I will feature others. One of the traditions my old friend's family always celebrated was The Feast of Seven Fishes or, Festa dei Sette Pesci.\nA southern Italian tradition known as the \"Vigilia di Natale\" commemorates the wait for the midnight birth of the baby Jesus. Italian-American families around Christmas time gather together to celebrate Christmas with a huge dinner made up of seven different fish and seafood dishes coming in all different types of forms.\nItalian-American immigrants - homesick for the land they left behind - combined classic Italian dishes with seafood. The sea was a representation of the connection between their home country and the new one.\nThe number seven stems from the biblical importance of the number and its lucky connotation. While many of these symbols are taken from Catholicism and Italian tradition, the Feast of the Seven Fishes is virtually unheard of in Italy and instead is considered an Italian-American tradition.\nBaked Clams, Baccala, Mussels, Calamari and Lobster are some of the dishes you'll see being served. Here on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, we have oysters, rock fish and so many other forms of seafood native to our bays and Atlantic coast.\nFor a holiday so widely celebrated, the traditions surrounding Christmas are as unique as the ornaments that decorate your tree.\nFrom decor, songs, stories and gifts, Christmas looks a little bit different in every home across the world, but the \"reason for the season\" never changes.\nWhether you're having any of the below recipes or baking a chicken or turkey or prime rib with potatoes, the time you are spending with family and friends is the most important.\nCLAMS WITH LINGUINE\nKosher salt, 12 oz linguine, 4 tbsp unsalted butter, 4 cloves garlic finely chopped, 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, 2 dozen littleneck clams (scrubbed), 1/2 cups dry white wine, juice of 1 lemon plus wedges for serving, freshly ground black pepper.\nIn a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente according to package directions. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid. Meanwhile, in another large pot over medium heat, melt butter.\nAdd garlic, parsley and red pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add clams and wine. Cover pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook until clam shells open, 7 to 10 minutes. (Discard any unopened clams.) Add lemon juice, linguine and 1/4 cup pasta water, tossing frequently and adding more pasta water if needed, until glossy and warmed through, about 2 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Divide pasta among bowls. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.\nBACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS\n1 lb. dry sea scallops (about 14), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 8 oz bacon (about 7 strips, not thick-cut), 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, 1 clove garlic (smashed), 1 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves, lemon wedges for serving.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Pat scallops dry with paper towels; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cut bacon slices in half crosswise so you get 3-to 4-inch long strips. Wrap bacon around scallops and secure with a toothpick. Arrange scallops on a prepared sheet. In a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add garlic and thyme leaves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Spoon butter and thyme over scallops, leaving garlic in the pan. Roast scallops until bacon is crisp and scallops are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove toothpicks.\nTransfer scallops to a platter and serve warm with lemon wedges alongside.\nMUSSELS WITH TOMATO AND GARLIC\n2 tbsp. butter, 1 onion chopped, 3 cloves garlic minced, 1 15-oz. can diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 2 lb. mussels (scrubbed and debearded).\nIn a pot over medium-low heat, melt butter. Add onion and cook until fragrant and soft, 5 minutes, then add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add diced tomatoes, wine and parsley and stir until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Add mussels and simmer until all shells are open. Discard any shells that aren't open.\nGarnish with more parsley and serve with a hard bread such as sour dough.\nOYSTERS ROCKEFELLER\n2 cloves garlic, 1 cup tightly packed fresh spinach, 1/2 cup roughly chopped green onions, 1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley, leaves and stems, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter softened, 3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs, 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1 lb. coarse salt, 24 fresh oysters (shucked, shells reserved), lemon wedges for serving. Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees. Add garlic, spinach, green onions, parsley, lemon juice, butter and Pernod to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. In a medium bowl combine, panko, Parmesan and oil. Sprinkle coarse salt over a large baking sheet to a depth of 1/2\".\nArrange oysters in half shells in salt. Divide spinach mixture among oysters and sprinkle with Parmesan mixture. Bake until the spinach mixture is bubbling and the Panko is deeply golden, about 8 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.\nGARLIC LEMON MAHI MAHI\n3 tbsp. unsalted butter divided, 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil divided, 4 (4-oz.) mahi mahi fillets, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1 lb. asparagus trimmed, 3 cloves garlic finely chopped, 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 2 lemons (1 sliced, 1 zested and juiced), 1 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley plus more for serving. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil until butter is melted. Add mahi mahi; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add asparagus and cook, tossing occasionally, until tender, 2 to 4 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Transfer to a plate with fish. SteIn same skillet over medium heat, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute, then stir in lemon slices, zest, and juice, and parsley.\nRemove from heat. Return mahi mahi and asparagus to the skillet and spoon sauce over. Top with parsley before serving.\nBAKED COD\n4 cod filets (about 1\" thick), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 4 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1 cup cherry tomatoes, 1 lemon, 2 garlic cloves (smashed but not peeled), 2 sprigs thyme, 2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and pat cod filets with a paper towel until dry. Season all over with salt and pepper. Combine olive oil, cherry tomatoes, lemon slices, garlic, and thyme in a 9 by 13 inch baking dish.\nToss to coat and spread into an even layer. Nestle cod pieces into a baking dish.\nBake until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on thickness of filets. Serve garnished with parsley, more lemon juice, and pan sauce.\nGARLIC PARMESAN FLOUNDER\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 fillets flounder, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 4 cloves garlic (minced), juice and zest of 1 lemon, fresh chopped parsley for garnish. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil on a large baking sheet. Season flounder with salt and pepper.\nOn a large plate, combine parmesan, bread crumbs, garlic and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper.\nDredge fish in bread crumb mixture, pressing to coat.\nPlace fish on a prepared baking sheet and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and lemon juice. Bake until golden and fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 minutes. Squeeze a bit more lemon on top and garnish with chopped parsley.\nI wish each and every one of you a safe, warm and blessed holiday with family and friends. \n \n Caption: METRO CREATIVE SERVICES\n\n Oysters Rockefeller come together in under half an hour and make a great addition to a holiday spread. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wiedefeld and other representatives of the Maryland Department of Transportation met Tuesday, Oct. 3, with Caroline County officials to discuss the department's six-year draft FY 2024-2029 Consolidated Transportation Program.The spending plan \"calls for a $21.2 billion, six-year investment to create a safer, cleaner, efficient and accessible transportation system connecting Marylanders to jobs, schools, recreation, health care and essential services,\" according to a MDOT press release.\"Delivering safe, reliable, equitable and sustainable transportation is critical to Maryland's economic health and the vibrancy of neighborhoods across the state. This draft CTP is inspired by that mission,\" Wiedefeld said.\"We know there are challenges ahead, and we are committed to fiscal responsibility and collaboration with local communities, stakeholders and elected officials as we deliver the transportation network Marylanders need and deserve,\" he said.In addition to Wiedefeld, officials attending included State Highway Deputy Administrator for Project Development Matt Baker; Motor Vehicle Administrator Chrissy Nizer; Maryland Transportation Authority Planning and Program Development Director Melissa Williams; Maryland Transit Administration Local Transit Support Director Travis Johnston; Maryland Aviation Administration Regional Aviation Director Ashish Solanki; and District 2 Engineer Ken Fender.At the meeting, transportation officials offered details and updates of several projects and programs affecting Caroline County.Baker said the agency is planning for potential improvements along three miles of state Route 404 from Harmony Road to Greenwood Road. A study looking at pedestrian and bicyclist safety improvements and traffic operations, as well as truck and agricultural traffic, is anticipated to be completed in spring 2024. An in-person open house meeting planned for this fall. In addition, a public survey to gather feedback on the study is available at mdot-sha-md404-harmony-rd-to-greenwood-rdco219b11-maryland.hub.arcgis.com/Baker said the State Highway Administration will advertise a $1 million contract for improvements at the state Routes 404 and 328 intersection, which will add turn lanes for safer traffic flow.Some interim improvements have been made to help reduce intersection conflicts and improve traffic flow during peak school bus times.Transportation officials noted other allocations for Caroline County in the draft CTP, including more than $1.1 million in operating and capital grants to support local transit operations provided by Delmarva Community Transit. In addition, Delmarva Community Service will receive a $123,000 Statewide Transit Innovation Grant to install a propane station for propane-powered vehicles, enabling Delmarva Community Transit to transition to a low-emission fleet.As \"a charter member of the Ken Fender Fan Club,\" Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter thanked the District 2 engineer for his responsiveness, especially with improving traffic flow at the Goldsboro Volunteer Fire Company and traffic light timing at the intersection of River Road (State Route 328) and State Route 404, calling the latter a \"tremendous benefit.\" Porter cited concerns with highway user funds being slashed to $400,00 from a high of $4 million, and a proposed mileage tax for electric vehicles.Wiedefeld said addressing changes in policy affecting EVs \"is a challenge that's coming at us. We don't have any answers yet.\" Caroline County Commission President Travis Breeding brought up the \"four old timber bridges that were built in the '30s and '40s that are on our list that need to be replaced.\" Breeding said someone from MDOT \"actually reached out to us to start the conversation about potentially pursuing some federal funding because these bridges are probably a million dollars or better a piece to replace, and that would just be too large of a hit on our (county).\" Commissioner Frank Bartz thanked the State Highway Administration for repaving Route 578 between Harmony and Bethlehem but expressed concerns about future traffic detours when the Williston bridge is eventually replaced on state Route 16.Other concerns brought up by the commissioners were the long transport times for emergency services and the effectiveness of DCT's fixed routes versus a mobility-on-demand model.The draft CTP includes funding to maintain existing transportation facilities, expand transit opportunities, invest in Maryland's economic growth and support the state's long-term goals for mobility, safety, equity, environmental stewardship and economic growth.The program allocates funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, as well as investment in the transition to zero-emission transit buses and other carbon reduction and resiliency programs, \"establishing Maryland as national leader in addressing climate goals,\" the press release stated.The program includes funding to promote Transit-Oriented Development to spur economic growth in transit corridors, and for projects to support Complete Streets - an initiative to make Maryland's roadways safer and more accessible for all users, and help reduce the number of roadway fatalities and injuries.The program outlines investments in each mode funded by the Transportation Trust Fund: Maryland Aviation Administration, Maryland Port Administration, Maryland Transit Administration, Motor Vehicle Administration, State Highway Administration and The Secretary's Office, as well as Maryland's investment in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.The plan includes an additional $2.7 billion investment planned by the Maryland Transportation Authority. Receiving no funds from the Transportation Trust Fund, the Maryland Transportation Authority's toll facilities are fully financed, constructed, operated, maintained, improved and protected with toll revenues paid by customers using those facilities.Motor Vehicle Administrator Nizer discussed the state's Vision Zero initiative - the goal of achieving zero fatalities on Maryland roadways. She noted that jurisdictions and organizations are encouraged to apply for safety grants through the Maryland Highway Safety Office to use for enforcement and education efforts.The Caroline County meeting was part of the Maryland Department of Transportation's tour of all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City to discuss the funding plan and receive input from local officials and the public. The tour continues into November.Following the tour, the draft fiscal year 2024-2029 Consolidated Transportation Program will be finalized and submitted in January for consideration during the 2024 General Assembly session.To view the full the program, visit ctp.maryland.gov. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCaroline County Commission President Travis Breeding, left, and Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul J.

    "content": "For All Seasons gives update on human trafficking in Talbot County\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 421\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Representatives from For All Seasons say the problem of human trafficking in Talbot County is persisting, though they are seeing positive gains in awareness and detection.During a Talbot County Council meeting Tuesday, Lauren Weber, the nonprofit's vice president of strategy and development, provided an update to council members regarding human and labor trafficking.\n\"It is happening and it's happening here. That continues to be the case,\" Weber said. \" … There's a complexity to human trafficking that it doesn't really know county boundaries.\"\nWeber and Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications, each said the organization has a special role given its wide reach. For All Seasons' presence in the five Mid-Shore counties — Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot — is critical to providing victims with essential services.\n\"We know that human trafficking knows no boundaries and that it affects people of different backgrounds, races, genders,\" Theeke said. \"We have seen several cases come through our doors, and it comes from Talbot County. It comes from neighboring counties. We really aim to be the connector to get those people the help that they need.\"\nCouncil Member Keasha Haythe asked if For All Seasons is seeing a decline in human trafficking numbers. Weber said it's a \"double-edged sword.\"\n\"A year ago we sat in front of you and said, when we look at our rape crisis center data, a good fifth of what was coming in was having at least one indicator of human trafficking,\" Weber said. \" … That persists.\"\nThe organization has noticed a shift in how many people are recognizing signs of human trafficking and making those reports, Weber says.\n\"The folks that are self-referring, we're seeing a decline,\" she said. \"But we're seeing a real rapid incline in folks coming to us and saying, 'Hey, I know more and now I've seen something.'\"\nWeber said that since September, more than 120 people have taken For All Seasons' free, online anti-human trafficking course.\nFor All Seasons is an official regional navigator for the Mid-Shore area, Theeke said, meaning it works on task forces and serves youth and young adults that are victims of trafficking.\nAt the end of the discussion, council members thanked the For All Seasons representatives for their work and presented the organization with a proclamation Tuesday declaring January as National Human Trafficking Awareness Month.\n\"We know that even one victim is too many,\" council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"We appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the COVID-19 pandemic presented a crisis unlike any other.At the same time, it brought a rare opportunity.\nThrough the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), Maryland received $3.7 billion in federal relief funds. Jacobs estimated that roughly $88 million of that flowed into his district over the past five years.\n\"The money gave counties and municipalities a chance to get things done when they normally might not have had that opportunity,\" Jacobs said.\nAcross the district, more than 200 projects were funded through ARPA, aimed at bolstering local infrastructure, supporting nonprofits and modernizing essential services.\nRock Hall to Queen Anne's: Local Needs, Local SolutionsEach town took a unique approach, reflecting ARPA's flexible framework.\nIn Rock Hall, the town's aging wastewater system was a priority. Mayor James Cook said of the $1.3 million received, $300,000 went toward replacing the headworks at the sewer plant — a key filter that removes debris such as grease and rags from wastewater.\nChestertown formed a task force led by Ward 2 Council member Tom Herz to ensure transparency and community input. Of the $4.25 million allocated, local nonprofits were invited to align funding requests with the town's comprehensive plan.\nIn Galena, $570,000 supported road improvements designed to make parks more accessible and attract visitors.\nBetterton directed its $311,000 toward modernizing its website to be ADA-compliant, enabling online payments, purchasing an air purifying unit, and upgrading pump stations with generators for resilience.\nMillington received $504,821, though specific projects were not detailed.\nQueen Anne's County saw one of the largest allocations: $16.3 million. Projects included installing 3,300 feet of water line at the Old Towne Shopping Center, investing $900,000 to upgrade affordable housing units, and expanding broadband access with $1.5 million. Six new consoles were also added to the county's 911 backup center, and cell phone boosters were installed in public schools to strengthen communication in rural areas.\nCountywide Efforts and Broadband ExpansionIn Cecil County, where municipalities received a greater share of ARPA funds than the county itself, a major initiative focused on expanding high-speed internet. A $16.2 million broadband project combined $12.8 million in state funds, $2.5 million from internet service providers, and $900,000 in ARPA funds contributed by the county.\nAccording to county officials, additional ARPA investments went toward two emergency medical services paramedic stations and a new training center for the Cecil County Sheriff's Office.\nRising Sun used $2,300 for infrastructure repairs, while the Town of North East applied its share to enhance police department operations.\nIn Caroline County, which received just under $6.5 million, part of the funding was used for infrastructure, while a portion supported reentry programs and post-release case management for individuals leaving the Ordnance Road Detention Facility.\nJacobs noted that ARPA's flexibility was one of its most valuable aspects.\n\"It was not one size fits all,\" he said. \"Municipalities could use the money to meet their specific needs — with the only caveat being it must be spent by Dec. 31, 2026.\"\nAs ARPA Winds Down, Financial Pressure MountsNow, with the funding window closing, local governments are bracing for its absence. Jacobs said the drying up of ARPA funds is intensifying pressure on the state as the General Assembly works to pass the FY 2026 budget — which currently faces a $3.5 billion shortfall.\n\"Certain services were being relied on and now are cut off,\" Jacobs said. \"ARPA funds possibly would have kept some of these programs afloat.\"\nA notable cut is the reduction in senior care funding by the Maryland Department of Aging. Jacobs said the proposed $2.5 million budget — an 18% reduction — could translate to about $28,000 less per county. He warned this could destabilize staffing and services for vulnerable seniors, such as in-home care, transportation and meal delivery.\n\"These cuts will be felt, not by the lawmakers, but by ordinary hardworking folks who have to make decisions about affording food or putting gas in the car,\" he said.\nTalbot County: Planning for LongevityTalbot County took a strategic approach. Officials distributed surveys to identify community priorities, which included broadband access, public health, and household assistance.\nAccording to Cassandra Vanhooser, director of Talbot County Economic Development and Tourism, the county received about $7.2 million in ARPA funds. The goal, she said, was to ensure that projects wouldn't falter once federal dollars were gone.\n\"These are largely capital items, these are one-time items... a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said then Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher. \"We need to be very careful about how this is done.\"\nAmong Talbot's allocations:\n- $1.75 million to Easton Utilities' Connect Talbot project to expand broadband to rural residents.\n- $105,000 to the Chesapeake Center in Easton to replace a failing septic system and connect to county sewer.\n- $500,000 in grants for volunteer fire company equipment upgrades.\n\"People recognize that this is transformational money,\" Vanhooser said at the time of the funding discussion, \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a driving force for change and to impact the lives of our citizens.\"\nLooking AheadAs the Dec. 31, 2024 obligation deadline nears, and the Dec. 31, 2026 expenditure deadline looms, local leaders are focused on maximizing remaining funds while grappling with what comes next.\nJacobs is urging urgency from lawmakers.\n\"With less than 20 days in session,\" he said, \"the Assembly needs to come up with solutions — and fast.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Several additional properties are currently works in progress. When complete, $50,000 will have been dispersed to Main Street Corridor businesses using this 2024 award.\nRock Hall Main Street President Laurie Walters noted the program will be open again for 2025.

    "content": "The Oxford Museum celebrates 60 years with '60s theme\n\n June 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Wanda Whedbee knows her father would have been so proud to witness The Oxford Museum's 60th birthday party on Saturday.Whedbee's father, Lee Willey founded the museum in 1964. Whedbee said that six years later, Willey died of a heart attack, and so he didn't get to see the museum's growth over the years.\n\"I think it's amazing how it's grown,\" she said. \"And the reason it has grown like this is because of the people that moved (into) town. And so many of them have taken an interest in it and worked so hard to keep it going.\"\nFor many years, Whedbee was a docent at the museum. When people would come in, she said she would point to the museum's first pieces — glassware and pottery that her father excavated from the grounds of the old Maryland Military and Naval Academy in town — and tell them about the museum's humble beginnings.\n\"And I would say, 'Look around. And if you really work hard, that's what you can accomplish,'\" she said.\nSaturday afternoon, community members had the opportunity to celebrate that growth — and another year around the sun for the museum — with the museum's current exhibit, \"Oxford 1964: The Times They Were A-Changin,'\" and cake and ice cream.\nTerrie and Barry Smale, who haven't been to the museum in a decade, were blown away when they returned Saturday. They said it has transformed since their last visit.\nTerrie's favorite part of the current exhibit was the 1960s area in the back corner of the museum, which was complete with vinyl records, a TV from the '60s and a rotary dial phone hanging on the wall. Terrie said she remembered having the same TV when she was growing up.\nAt the event, LIza Ledford and John Tochko were named winners of the Doug Hanks Jr. Oxford Preservation Award, which recognizes the efforts of people or organizations to preserve Oxford's history and heritage.\nLedford, who is the executive director of the Oxford Community Center, said the award means everything to her.\n\"It means the world to me to feel recognized by the public and the town, and just to feel that people are appreciating the stuff we're putting out there,\" she said.\nLedford has been with the community center for seven years. She said she feels lucky that what she loves to do every day is getting appreciated by the community.\n\"Thank you to everyone who was part of making this happen,\" she said. \"And I share it with everybody who's part of the Oxford Community Center.\"\nTochko, who could not be in attendance Saturday, has been chairman of the Museum Building Committee for the last few years. When the winners were announced, Tochko was praised for his \"quiet\" support of different local organizations over the years and his involvement with the community center.\nBecause of the high temperatures outside, the museum's birthday party was held inside the museum Saturday afternoon. The Oxford Museum Executive Director Julie Wells said she knew the event would be crowded if it was held inside the museum.\n\"But we like being with each other,\" she said, later adding, \"This is such a happy event.\"\nThe Oxford Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays through Mondays. Admission is free. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Austin Frank drilled a leadoff double to center field. Colton Maans walked and was lifted for courtesy runner Wes Thomas. Eric Deck (2 for 3) singled to center, scoring Frank. Gavin Whitby (2 for 3) singled to load the bases before Johnny Radcliff grounded out, scoring Thomas to make it 3-2\nBut Spurry ended the threat there, getting a strikeout before catcher Nicolopolous alertly grabbed a ball that was chopped in front of the plate and tagged Caleb Cole for an inning-ending, unassisted putout.\nCaroline rallied to pull even in the top of the sixth on Whitby's one-out RBI single. Again, Spurry escaped any further damage, retiring two of the next three batters to keep it at 3-3 heading into the home half of the sixth.\n\"Threw strikes,\" Talbot manager Albert Pritchett said of Spurry, who finished with four strikeouts and two walks. \"Got ahead of every batter, mixed it up. Very impressive.\"\nTalbot (1-0) took a 1-0 lead in the home first. Frank issued back-to-back walks to Gavin Murphy and Couper Barletta. Two batters later, Pearson Greenwood laced a double to right field, plating Murphy. Frank squelched the rally there, getting Ethan Royer to pop out and Jesus Crespo on a comebacker to the mound.\nPost 70 pushed its lead to 2-0 in the second. Brennen Griffin (2 for 2) hit a leadoff single and Nathan Merchant walked. Spurry then hit an 0-2 offering into left-center field for a double that scored Griffin. Again Frank extinguished a potential big rally, striking out the next three straight batters.\nTalbot made it 3-0 in the third, as Tim McGuckin worked a leadoff walk, stole second, advanced to third on Greenwood's groundout to first, and scored when Crespo singled sharply to left field.\nCaroline pulled even in the sixth before Talbot moved back in front in the home sixth. Nicolopoulos worked a leadoff walk against Post 29 reliever Chase Hitchens then stole second. Hitchens came off the mound to catch Brody McDaniel's bunt attempt for the first out. Nicolopoulos advanced to third on an errant pickoff attempt. Spurry then grounded out deep in the hole at shortstop, allowing Nicolopolous to score what proved to be the winning run.\n\"Knocked in the winning run for himself,\" Pritchett said of Spurry. \"Nice game.\n\"First game, little rusty,\" said Pritchett, who was without Cullen Murphy, Josh Dressler and Anthony Massaro Tuesday. \"Some of the guys haven't played since high school (season ended). We could have had a few more runs, but I think the hitting will come around.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Evergreen Fresh - Cawley Tree Farm offers variety of fresh trees, greens\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 773\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - They've been farming west of Denton more than 100 years, and for over a quarter of that century, Cawley Family Farm has branched out to become the only Christmas tree farm in Caroline County.On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, a steady stream of families rolled up the lane of the farm, past the festively decorated John Deere combine, past the Cawley family home and past a huge pavilion housing cut evergreen trees from North Carolina.\"It's a beautiful day,\" said owner Charles Cawley.\" It's going good. We've got good trees. I got some beautiful trees - a little pricier than last year but still beautiful trees - got a lot on the lot, as you can see. The Canaans are going out of here like crazy.\" In addition to Canaan firs, Cawley grows Concolor and Douglas firs, blue spruce and white pine - all on about 15 acres of the farm.\"We can't grow Frasers, so we bring them in,\" Cawley said.\"But we're the only one that brings in a tree, recuts it and puts it in holding tanks. No one else does that. So we sell the freshest pre-cut trees you can buy.\" \"They're very hard to get, but we've got some beautiful Frasers,\" he said.Cawley said it took him a while, but he \"got to how to grow\" Canaan firs about 15 years ago.He pampers them, irrigating, spoon-feeding and growing them in \"real thick grass. It helps keep the roots cooler because it gets too hot here,\" he said.According to the National Christmas Tree Association, the Canaan fir is a \"relative newcomer to the Christmas tree market, with many similarities to both Fraser and balsam firs.\" About 500 to 600 trees are brought in from North Carolina.\"We sold about 200 off the lot, so we're selling between 700 and 800 a year,\" Cawley said.Keeping the trees fresh is important to Cawley. \"When we sell one of these (Frasers) they'll hold the needles as long as one of those out in the field,\" he said. \"And these things drink a lot of water initially. I mean, we just got these the day before Thanksgiving, and I had to fill these tanks up a couple times, they soaked up that much water.\" Once the trees are rehydrated, they are shaken, drilled with a tapered bit, set up on a pin stand in a shallow steel basin and kept watered. The operation has two drilling machines, three shakers and plenty of water holding bins inside and outdoors.The 55-foot by 80-foot pavilion can be closed off when the wind whips up to keep the trees from dehydrating. \"If we had to add a little heat, we can, but we haven't had to,\" he said.Cawley clearly takes pride in his product, and his family pitches in. Arriving at 7 a.m. was his 7-year-old grandson Bryant, ready to get started - and put in a 12-hour day.Cawley's eldest daughter, Amy, makes wreaths and wood-burned ornaments from slices of sawed off stumps. The focus is on customer service, so other family members, as well as employees, wait on customers, shake needles from trees, wrap net around them and tote them to cars.Cawley is vice president of the Maryland Christmas Tree Association. He said he started out as a farmer, \"but I did a lot of things in the meantime,\" even working for \"all three levels of government - county, state and federal. You don't build this by just farming. It takes something else,\" Cawley said, adding that his wife Jane is a retired school nurse.Several years of drought, along with root aphids in the Douglass firs and scale on some Canaans, have affected the growth and aesthetics of a few trees in the field, so Cawley has to be vigilant.\"There's a challenge every year,\" he said.Cawley Family Farm Christmas tree sales began Nov. 21.You can visit 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday to Thursday by appointment. The farm is located at 24320 Willow Pond Road, Denton. For more information, call 410-479-4780 or 410-829-4781, or email info@cawley.farm.

    "content": "Country Cooking: Shrimp, an Eastern Shore tradition\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1529\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Growing up on the farm, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay as well as the many rivers, we ate many types of seafood, but shrimp was not my favorite dish.Shrimp has a long history in the Delmarva region, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries. While not typically fished with a large-scale commercial harvest due to gear restrictions like the beam trawl ban, shrimp populations have been present and studied for decades. Recent observations suggest increasing shrimp populations in the area, possibly due to factors like warming waters.\nShrimp have always been found around the Chesapeake Bay, which is replete with the marshy, muddy habitat they love. Shrimp like to bury in sediment and can be found in both the Bay and its river estuaries, from shallow to deep water. Around the last week of October each year, a sudden drop in temperature drives the shrimp to funnel out of the Bay and into the southern Atlantic, where the water is a little warmer.\nThe shrimping industry is most popular in the Gulf states of Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Texas. In the last five years, shrimp sales volume increased from 275 million pounds to 415 million. The percentage of households buying fish has also increased from 44.2% to 48.6%. This growth is seen in all areas of the country.\nShrimp is an excellent, affordable meal option for families. Shrimp can be enjoyed as an appetizer, snack, main course or side dish. Shrimp is a great addition to many popular favorites as it's easy to toss some shrimp into a creamy pasta or grill up some prawns to top your preferred cut of steak.\nIn later years, I discovered shrimp and became a \"shrimp lover.\" My parents really didn't care for shrimp, so therefore when I became a cook in my own kitchen, I ventured into exploring many different foods. The same happens generation after generation, introductions to different foods.\nJUMBO STEAMED SHRIMP\n1/2 cup vinegar, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 3/4 cup water, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 lbs jumbo shrimp.\nIn a medium sized saucepan combine vinegar, Old Bay, water and salt. Bring these ingredients to a boil. Add shrimp. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the liquid. Cover and steam for 5 to 6 minutes or until tender. Drain and serve.\nSHRIMP AND RICE\n1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper, 3 tbsps flour, small can tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp hot sauce, 1 1.2 lbs pre-cooked shrimp, rice.\nMelt butter, add onion and green pepper, mix well with the butter. Mix in flour, stirring until bubbly. Add tomato sauce, water and hot sauce. Cook slowly for about 10 minutes. Add shrimp and cook slowly for another 10-15 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.\nSHRIMP SCAMPI\n1 1/2 cups olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 4 crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 4 lbs raw shrimp (shelled and deveined).\nIn a large skillet, place olive oil, lemon juice, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Heat thoroughly and add shrimp. Stir well and cook until the shrimp are pink. Serve with rice.\nSHRIMP STIR FRY\n2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 lb shrimp (peeled and deveined), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 small head of broccoli (cut into small florets), 1 red bell pepper (seeds and ribs removed, thinly sliced), 8 oz sugar snap peas, 3 garlic cloves (minced), 1 tbsp finely chopped peeled ginger, 1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce, juice of 1 lime, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.\nIn a large wok or skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add shrimp; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, turning halfway through, until pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a plate. In the same skillet over medium heat, heat sesame oil. Add broccoli, bell pepper, and peas and cook, stirring and adding a splash of water if browning too quickly, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Add to the skillet and toss to coat. Add shrimp and cook, tossing frequently, until heated through, about 2 minutes.\nOLD BAY SHRIMP BURRITOS\nFor Old Bay aioli: 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tsp Sriracha, 3/4 tsp fresh lime juice, 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning (plus more for serving), Kosher salt. For shrimp filling: 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 small green bell pepper (diced), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1 lb small shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails removed), 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp paprika, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper. For assembling burrito: 4 large flour tortillas (warmed), 1 cup cooked long-grain white rice, 1 cup cooked black beans (rinsed and drained), 3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese, 1 cup shredded lettuce, 1 cup pico de gallo (drained), 1 avocado (thinly sliced), 2 tbsps chopped chives (plus more for serving).\nMake aioli: Whisk together mayo, Sriracha, lime juice, Old Bay, and 1 teaspoon water. Season with salt, if desired. Make shrimp filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add oil, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in shrimp, cumin, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Assemble burritos: Lay a tortilla on a serving plate. Add 1/4 cup each of the rice and beans. Top with ¼ each of the shrimp filling, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and avocado slices. Sprinkle with chives and drizzle with aioli. Roll the burrito tightly and repeat with remaining tortillas and ingredients. Slice each burrito in half and serve with more aioli, Old Bay and chives.\nSWEET CORN, SHRIMP & RICE SKILLET\n1/2 cup basmati rice, 1 bunch scallions (divided), 1 medium red bell pepper (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (5 roughly chopped, 1 minced), 4 tbsps white miso, 1-inch piece ginger (thinly sliced), 1 1/4 tsp turmeric powder (divided), 1 tsp Kosher salt (plus more for seasoning), 1 tsp granulated sugar (optional), 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional), 4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil (divided), 1/2 lb medium shrimp (peeled and cleaned), freshly ground black pepper, 3/4 cup water, 1 cup frozen corn (rinsed in warm water and drained), lime wedges for serving.\nRinse rice well, until water runs clear, then transfer to a medium bowl and cover with water. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cook 5 roughly chopped garlic cloves and ginger in a pan for around 1 minute. Remove roots and ends from 4 green onions and roughly chop into pieces. Add chopped scallions to blender or food processor, along with the bell pepper, garlic cloves, miso, ginger, 1 teaspoon turmeric, salt, and sugar and cayenne if using. Blend until all ingredients are finely chopped and thoroughly mixed, then slowly drizzle in 3 tablespoons olive oil while running the food processor or blender. Blend until mixture is smooth. Pat shrimp dry and transfer to a medium bowl. Add remaining turmeric and minced garlic clove, and season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch oven safe skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and cook until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove cooked shrimp into a bowl just big enough to fit and cover with a plate to keep warm. Return the skillet to heat and add prepared puree. Cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid has cooked out and paste has darkened, 8 to 10 minutes. (You'll know it's done when the oil starts to separate from the paste! Reduce heat to medium and whisk in water until smooth. Strain rice, and add rice and corn. Drain any cooking juices from the shrimp into the skillet, using the plate to keep the shrimp from falling in. (Be sure to keep shrimp covered. Stir to incorporate everything, then bring mixture up to a simmer. Place in a preheated oven and cover tightly with a lid or sheet pan. Bake until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 23 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining green onions for garnish. Fluff rice with a fork, then scoop into serving dishes. Top with cooked shrimp and green onions and serve with lime wedges on the side.\nSHEET PAN SHRIMP\n1 lb. baby red potatoes (quartered), 1 1/2 lb raw medium shrimp (peeled and deveined), 2 ears of corn (cut crosswise into 4 pieces each), 2 links smoked andouille sausage (thinly sliced), 2 lemons (sliced), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 2 tbsps melted butter, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 2 tbsps freshly chopped parsley for garnish.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. In a large bowl, combine cooked potatoes, shrimp, corn, sausage, lemons, garlic powder, Old Bay, melted butter, and oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss until combined, then divide between two large baking sheets. Bake until shrimp is cooked through and corn is tender, 13 to 15 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Always plenty to be thankful for in Maryland\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It should be easy for most of us to be thankful in Maryland. Thanksgiving has just about arrived, that special day for reflection, for sharing our gratitude and for enjoying a splendidly large meal with those we love.We've mostly been spared the political rancor that marked much of the election season nationwide. The local campaigning leading up to filling out our ballots earlier this fall was mostly crisp and clean.\nSo as we prepare ourselves for the Thanksgiving holiday, let's hope that peace and civility will prevail, at least for a day. Let's hope that when extended families convene for the old familiar feast, debate won't rage between red and blue, but about whether dark meat is more delicious than white meat as the turkey is carved.\nThanksgiving is a legacy of early colonial America, when European settlers thanked God for the harvest that allowed people to survive under difficult conditions. These days, of course, only a dwindling portion of our population here still has lives so closely tied to the harvest. Most of us take comfortable shelter and an adequate food supply for granted every day.\nDid you know that we have a president, a secretary of state and the author of \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" to thank for Thanksgiving becoming a fully recognized holiday in the United States?\nEditor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale launched her campaign in 1827 to see the annual Thanksgiving tradition dating back a couple hundred years become an official holiday. She started with President John Quincy Adams — son of Founding Father John Adams — and finally found success many years later with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Secretary of State William Seward penned Lincoln's proclamation, which came in \"the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity.\"\n\"I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens,\" Lincoln's proclamation reads.\nWell, 2024 has certainly been a year, but we still have so much to be thankful for, each and everyone of us.\nIn a way, we're all accidents of birth, and ongoing accidents of geography. We could be anywhere else in the world — and plenty of those places have more than enough misery to go around. Gratitude for our peace, safety and security here at home would be in order.\nWe should also be thankful for the people in our community who will be required to postpone their feasts to help others in need. We can take comfort in knowing that police and hospital staff will be on the job, and volunteer firefighters and other first responders could be pressed into service at any time if there's an emergency.\nThen there are those thoughtful souls who make sure that anyone who wants to come out can enjoy an absolutely free hot Thanksgiving family-style meal and fellowship. Food banks, soup kitchens and churches around the region help make sure that happens.\nFor sure, this holiday season that officially kicks off next week and runs all the way through New Year's Day can stretch time, money and sometimes patience particularly thin. But let's face it, most of us have plenty for which to be thankful. And we should have little reason not to feel blessed and grateful on Thanksgiving and every day.\nOur community is strong. And through the works large and small of all our friends and neighbors, we will only continue to get stronger. And for that, too, we offer our thanks.\nEven in our nation's darkest times, Lincoln and Seward found much to be celebrated: \"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and even soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\nWe can all take their words to heart as we head into the holiday season. We can look to the good. We can focus on the positive. We can find our way forward with thankfulness and love in our hearts.\nWe wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The competitive spirit, the history, his greatness, it allows me to just appreciate all that we've been through, all the battles back and forth and the fact that in 2024, we're still doing it. Somehow the games are pretty electric, kind of a must-see-TV-type situation. And I love it.\" — Golden State's Stephen Curry, on facing James.\"What LeBron is doing, it could happen again. I just don't see it. … LeBron is deadly serious about taking care of his body. Most people wouldn't do what LeBron does off the floor, and that's why they don't last. LeBron has decided to do it all, and that's why he lasts. But it's amazing to watch.\" — Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers.\n\"The details of winning matter to him. I just wish that I could have had all of our young players watch him in the team meetings, every locker room and film session. Every franchise is saying the same thing: 'You need to communicate. You need to be present in these sessions.' And LeBron is not fatigued at all in terms of preparation and being involved and all of that, noticing things on film and being an active participant in that. And you want young players to see that.\" — Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra.\n\"I think in the case of LeBron, there's a mental aspect of it as well. I think all of us know that, in addition to keeping in tip-top shape physically, he works a lot on his mind. And that ability, over having played that many years in the league, to stay motivated, to maintain a level of concentration, maintain a level of motivation ... he's amazing to watch.\" — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.\n\"It's a blessing, for sure. It's definitely a blessing to be able to have fans.\" — James, when asked what it's like to be cheered in road arenas.\n\"He knows what he's talking about. He pays attention. He supports the game. He doesn't just talk about it. He really shows up and supports. I think that's the coolest thing; one of the greatest players of all time really helping support and grow women's basketball. That's exactly what we need. He's somebody I've always idolized.\" — WNBA rookie of the year Caitlin Clark, earlier this year at the NCAA women's Final Four. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was also bird song from the woods and the sound of bullfrogs from the pond.The crowd was large, with 300 tickets sold for the event. Multiple environmental groups and government agencies hosted information tables.\nEastern Redbud saplings were given out for attendees to plant at home by Francis Smith of the Maryland Forest Service. There were master gardeners and monarch butterfly experts. A birding trip led into the forest in the morning.\n\"Earth Day heightens our awareness and appreciation. It is joyful and good to get out. And it is fun to host this site to share with other local nonprofits,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director of Adkins.\n\"It reminds us to breathe, step out in nature. It is incredible for your soul, your brain,\" Tiernan said. \"It is amazing how clear you can think after a walk in the woods. I took a walk the other day, and a pileated woodpecker just swooped down in front of me. There were pine warblers in my ear. It is just affirming too that we are here on Earth with all of these animals, and we are a part of them.\"\nAdkins celebrated the global holiday a little early this year, with Earth Day actually falling on Monday.\nEarth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First held on April 22, 1970, it now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally.\nJay Falstad, Adkins Arboretum board member and Executive Director of Queen Anne's Conservation Association, was using yellow and orange chalk to create a big sun at the arboretum's entrance.\n\"Earth Day is the one thing that we all share. We all share the same air, water and the same planet. We should all have an investment in protecting it,\" Falstad said.\nThere were many people who have worked hard to make this event happen. Not just organizing and planning but executing a fun educational experience.\nJenny Houghton, assistant director of Adkins Arboretum, said, \"We are partnering with other environmental organizations. We thought it would be nice to show people that we are all working together. We have Pickering Creek, Tuckahoe State Park, Maryland DNR, Bartlett Tree Experts, Shore Rivers, Talbot County Master Gardeners and Phillips Wharf Environmental Center.\"\n\"The highlight is getting people outside to celebrate nature together and listening to great music, eating local food and hopefully scooping up some tadpoles in the wetland. It is good to remind ourselves that the Earth is worth taking care of, because it is all that we have got,\" said Houghton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Visiting artists welcomed by Kent Cultural Alliance\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Arts \n \n 578\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Kent Cultural Alliance announces its first class of visiting artists for the SFW Residency for spring 2024.This inaugural residency session features three talented artists and educators from Alvin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; and Luray, Virginia. These artists will work under a collective theme of \"land\" as they explore agriculture, soil, family farms and more with local partners for the session — Kent County 4-H, Kent County High School Future Farmers of America, and Harborview Farms.\nThis social practice residency has its foundation in community engagement and seeks to create broader participation around issues important to the people who call this county home.\nTHE ARTISTS\nCanadian-American Austen Camille is an artist, writer, builder and naturalist whose studio practice is built on her early years moving schools and cities and working to note the particularities of a place. Residing in Alivn, Texas, Camille seeks reciprocal relationships between the built and natural environment in her work. Camille's interdisciplinary practice incorporates painting, sculpture, installation, writing, research, performance, new technologies and localized materials. She seeks to forge connections between the arts and other disciplines through it. She received her BA in studio art at Reed College and her MFA in painting at Temple University.\nAlyssa Dennis is an interdisciplinary artist, earth activist, educator and clinical herbalist from Baltimore, Maryland. Her art practice centers on conventional forms of building and the convenience that keeps us compartmentalized within a dangerously abstract relationship with nature and our own bodies. The imagery she creates explores the impact of manufactured landscapes on our internal and external ecosystems, shaping our existence with non-human life and, ultimately, ourselves. Dennis's work combines drawing, sculptural installation and the social/environmental practice of herbalism. In her multidisciplinary practice, she questions who the players are and what are the means for reclaiming non-human kinships as a necessary form of embodiment for the reversal of cultural and climate upheaval.\nWith a focus on printmaking, sculpture, storytelling and community, Dennis McNett is a multifaceted maker. Hailing from Luray, Virginia, he is known for his larger-than-life woodcut print-covered puppets and masks that are used to lead narrative ceremonies and public processions. McNett has had more than 30 visiting artist and lecturer appointments across the U.S. and abroad. He holds a BFA from Old Dominion University and an MFA from Pratt Institute, where he taught from 2004-2013. His works have been featured internationally at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the MOHS exhibit, the Museum of Print History and more.\nThe Kent Cultural Alliance offers several opportunities for the community to engage with resident artists. Some of those opportunities include the following dates. All events at the alliance's Raimond Cultural Center, 101 Spring Ave., Chestertown.\nThursday, April 4, 2024 at 7 p.m.: \"Meet the Residents — Artist Talk\"- Free. Come meet our resident artists, and learn about their practice and past projects. Reception to follow.\nSaturday, April 27, noon to 3 p.m.: \"Open Studio\" — opportunity to see our artists at work on their \"Land\" project.\nFriday, May 3, from 5-8 p.m.: Exhibit Opening — Come see the work created by our resident artists and learn from our partner organizations about this social practice residency experience.\nSaturday, May 4 at 1 p.m.: Artist Talk, join our artists one last time and hear about their work related to this residency.\nFriday, May 3 to Saturday, June 1: The \"Land\" residency exhibition will be open to the public for four weeks. Gallery hours will be Wednesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was constructed from heart pine, white oak, Atlantic cedar and western red cedar, and outfitted with a restored late-1930s Buda diesel engine.A retired engineering professor, Grigg Mullen maintained a hands-on role throughout the yearlong construction, working alongside CBMM's Shipyard crew whenever his schedule allowed.He and Cindy were on hand for a CBMM Member Night on Oct. 12 celebrating Mr. Dickie and the Oct. 20 launch for the new buyboat that is named in honor of the late Dickie Whaley, Mullen's neighbor growing up in Queen Anne's County.\"It's been a wonderful year building Mr. Dickie and working with the Shipyard folks,\" Mullen said. \"Every time there was a decision to make, it was always - if we do it this way, it's going to be better. It's turned out wonderfully.\"With Mr. Dickie completed, CBMM's Shipyard will stay busy with a variety of projects heading into the winter months, including ongoing work on a pair of buyboats in its historic floating fleet.Winnie Estelle, CBMM's passenger-carrying 1920 buyboat, is amidst a refit that includes the removal, fabrication, and replacement of its structural timbers. 1938 buyboat Choptank is undergoing a final fit out, which involves building out the interior with cabins and heads for expedition-style overnight trips and outfitting it with modern safety equipment and a new rig.Findmore information about CBMM's Shipyard and itsprojects at cbmm.org/ship-yard. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CBMM\n \nCBMM's Shipyard has recently completed its build of the 36-foot Chesapeake Bay buyboat Mr. Dickie.\n \nCOURTESY OF CBMM\n \nMr. Dickie will be on display later this month at the Sultana Downrigging Festival in Chestertown. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Meet the bikers who try – and fail – each year to erode Maryland’s helmet law\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 945\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of bikers in leather vests and wispy beards greets lawmakers here each Monday of the legislative session, hoping this is the year they'll succeed in their galvanizing cause: gutting a Maryland law that requires them to wear helmets.The group, which calls itself A Brotherhood Against Totalitarian Enactments, has experienced decades of setbacks on the helmet issue. Its vociferous critics say ABATE's position is at a minimum, eccentric and at worst, dangerous.\nBut driven by a burning belief in personal freedom and a joy for riding, ABATE has used persistent, grassroots activism to keep the helmet issue alive in Maryland. It's why in nearly every legislative session since the state's mandatory helmet law took effect in 1992, the Maryland General Assembly has at least considered a bill that would make wearing a helmet optional for most riders.\n\"It's been 32 years this year to no avail,\" Bob Spanburgh, Maryland ABATE's board chairman, said. \"But we keep introducing it. We have some pretty ardent supporters. We have a lot of people who think we're nuts, probably.\"\nLike many of its previous incarnations over the last three decades, this year's bill would make wearing a helmet optional if a motorcyclist is at least 21 years old, has been licensed for a minimum of two years and has completed a safety course. It is named in honor of Gary \"Pappy\" Boward, a former ABATE executive director and motorcycle rights advocate who died in 2020 of health issues.\nABATE and other supporters insist that they aren't opposed to riders wearing helmets if they so choose. But they feel the current mandate abridges freedom of choice and represents government overreach.\n\"I firmly believe that we as government do better when we educate people, [rather] than legislating something,\" said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett, Washington), the bill's primary Senate sponsor and a friend of Boward's. \"There are people that would like to have the choice [to not wear a helmet.] And I tend to believe that we should give people the choice but 100% support educating them about it.\"\nEstablished in 1974, ABATE will mark 50 years of advocacy for motorcyclists' rights this June. Its animating issue has been eroding Maryland's helmet law, different iterations of which have been in place since 1968. Today, Maryland joins 16 other states and the District of Columbia in requiring all riders to wear protective headgear.\nSpanburgh, a 66-year-old retired carpenter, only casually followed politics when he joined ABATE in the mid-1980s. Initially, he saw the group as a community of like-minded individuals, who shared his enthusiasm for bikes, firearms, the outdoors and rock and roll. But right away, ABATE turned Spanburgh into an unlikely activist.\n\"At the first meeting I went to, the thing they told me [was,] 'You got to register to vote. It's very important in this organization,'\" Spanburgh recalled. \"That was actually the first time I ever registered to vote in my life. I was 27 at the time.\"\nEach legislative session, the helmet bill faces cockeyed glances and prodigious odds. Contending with a wealth of scientific evidence, which shows crashes involving non-helmeted motorcyclists are much more likely to result in severe head trauma and death, the measure almost always dies in committee.\nBut ABATE ensures the issue is revived and relitigated, year after year, by finding ways to get in front of elected officials, despite limited financial resources and dwindling numbers. In the past, the group used a tactic involving following lawmakers into the bathroom to gain an audience and get its message heard.\n\"They're diehards for what they believe in,\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's) said. \"Thank God they do. They don't let go of this stuff. It's a tough fight over here to get that kind of legislation passed.\"\nWhile Republicans are the most likely to sympathize with ABATE's cause, the group engages lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. This year's bill, cross-filed as HB639 and SB503, has bipartisan sponsors in both chambers.\n\"I don't agree with them that they shouldn't wear a helmet, but I do agree about the civil liberty issue,\" said Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore city), one of the bill's Senate co-sponsors.\n\"They are adamant as dedicated motorcyclists that this is not something they want mandated to them,\" she added.\nIn a recent hearing of the House Environment and Transportation Committee, opponents included highway safety groups, medical associations and public health officials. They argued that a weaker helmet law would increase motorcyclists' risk of injury and death, impose an avoidable burden on taxpayers and encumber the healthcare system.\n\"A lot of people might say, 'Well, it's my free will to do whatever I want to do, no matter how stupid it is,'\" Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said in an interview. \"The problem is, when it comes to healthcare … your decision then ends up costing the entire system a whole lot of money.\n\"Not only is it the right thing to do and the smart thing to do — logical people wear helmets when they ride a motorcycle or a bike or other things — it also is appropriate from a common good and cost point of view,\" Ransom added.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee later this week. Spanburgh hopes to see the measure make it out of committee and get a vote on the House or Senate floor. If unsuccessful, proponents vow they won't stop trying.\n\"If I don't do it, who else is going to do it?\" said Ken Eaton, Maryland ABATE's executive director. \"We try to get other people to help us as much as possible. But if I don't do it, how can I convince other people to do it?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I remember a pamphlet that showed sinners drowning in a literal lake of fire for all eternity. Scary stuff.Author and pastor Rob Bell presents us with an interesting thought though — do we really believe that God, who loves us so much, is going to condemn billions of people, and reward only a select few with heaven? Will He really condemn these billions, throughout history, with eternal torment for things they did in a few short years of their life on Earth? It's not a question I would presume to know the answer to.\nI do know this, just as well as you do — our God is a God of love. He loves us so much that He gave His only begotten Son. Therefore, I prefer to substitute \"fear\" with \"love.\" For instance, Proverbs 1:7 tells us, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.\" I like to think that \"the love of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\"\nI must admit, I have no fear of the Lord. Instead, what I have is respect, reverence, awe, love and an appreciation of His love for me. The love He shows us cannot not be compared to anything else. The angels who appeared to the shepherds, in the Gospel of Luke, gave us good advice: \"Don't be afraid, because a savior is born.\"\nJesus came to us — God in the flesh — bringing love and salvation.\nIf we live a life of righteousness, following Christ, what do we have to fear? Nothing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Dec. 7, for the 14th consecutive year, they were again hosted by Kent Island American Legion Post 278, in Stevensville, under direction of Past Post Commander and the 2023 Maryland State Legionnaire of the Year Nikki Randolph.\nRandolph has earned a reputation for her passionate care for all veterans, making sure veteran grave sites are bestowed with American flags and Christmas wreaths at appropriate times of the year, every year.\nThe yearly tradition began when she was then commander of Post 278 and contacted Morrill and Karen Worcester of Maine, who had already begun the Wreaths Across America program - hauling Christmas wreaths from their state to the nation's capitol to place those wreaths on all veteran's grave sites at Arlington National Cemetery.\nRandolph and Legion 278 volunteers provided three meals, dinner, breakfast and boxed lunches to the convoy before they made the final leg of their journey to Arlington.\nThis year, the Wreaths Across America sent out over 3,000,000 Christmas wreaths across the nation to more than 4,200 locations to be placed on those grave sites. Most were placed on Saturday, Dec. 9.\nEleven wreaths were also presented to families connected to Post 278, whose veterans chose to be cremated rather than buried in a cemetery.\nOne of those was to the wife of the late George Dashiell, who served during World War II in Germany.\nMrs. Wally Dashiell, now 100-years-old has been a widow for the past 17 years. She said, \"I'm truly grateful that the Legion honored George in this way.\" The wreath was placed next to the urn that holds his ashes, the American flag presented during his memorial service, and a picture of George.\nFriday morning the convoy departed from Legion 278 along Route 8, children from both Matapeake Elementary and Middle Schools cheering and waving small American flags. An emotional scene, it was clear the children were excited to participate.\nSaturday at noon, American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 in Centreville, hosted their annual Wreaths Across America ceremony at Chesterfield Cemetery. Approximately 200 people were present, many of them children and teens with their parents. \n \n Caption: PHOTOS BY DOUG BISHOP\n\n U.S. Army veteran John Nizer is pictured laying a Christmas wreath for all POWs and Missing in Action veterans at the annual Wreaths Across American ceremony at Chesterfield Cemetery in Centreville, Saturday afternoon, Dec. 9.

In the coming months, Cambridge residents are likely to meet Solano as she begins her community outreach efforts.The Cambridge Center, Solano said, is a resource for everyone in Dorchester County, playing a critical role in the economic and social health of the downtown area.In addition to credit classes in both transfer and career programs, the center also offers workforce training, personal enrichment opportunities and meeting spaces for community organizations. The center also houses the American Job Center.\"We're an education center for students of all ages, but I hope residents here also see us as a center of community growth,\" Solano said.Solano first joined Chesapeake as an English as a Second Language instructor.She was later the academic and career advisor guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at UCR asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country.He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D. in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people. The Cambridge Center provides both, she added.For more information about the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center, please visit www.chesapeake.edu/cambridge. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. Lorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County Board of Ed declares last day of school, discuss virtual instruction\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Caroline County Board of Education declared Tuesday, June 17, as the last day of the extended school year after inclement weather closures exceeded the four days allotted.The last day will be a half day for students and a full day for teachers.\nNext year, county schools will have three allotted inclement weather days. At the April 1 Board of Education meeting, district officials explored options for implementing virtual instruction should weather cause unexpected closures.\nBecause of the challenges presented by district officials, the board concluded it thinks the district will not be able to conduct virtual instruction on inclement weather days.\n\"The structure we tried to take with the presentation was a condensed version of some the requirements that the school system would have to meet if the county were to entertain virtual weather days,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We walked through some real tough spots for us to get to those points.\"\nInternet Connection and Google Meets\nThere are multiple factors Caroline County board of education most consider to conduct virtual inclement weather days. Including ensuring every student has a hotspot or wifi to participate in virtual learning.\nRobert Wielgosz, supervisor of technology, led the discussion on cellular service, offering points on the Kajeet program.\nKajeet was a hotspot used during the pandemic for students to connect to the internet in areas where wifi access was limited and not available.\nAccording to Wielgosz, when given the opportunity to use Kajeet, some students would use the hotspot for personal uses like video games and movies. This overloaded the hotspots and caused delays.\nThe estimate cost for Caroline County to provide the 700 needed Kajeet devices over five years would be about $736,000 for students and $35,000 for teachers.\nWielgosz also mentioned the need for Google Meet Breakout Rooms, which teachers use to conduct learning activities with groups in virtual classrooms. While this feature was available at no cost, it is no longer available in Caroline County's free Google plan.\n\"To get the feature back, it's going to cost Caroline County somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year to get the premium Google aspect,\" Wielgosz said.\nMultilingual Learners, Special Education and Homelessness\nState law mandates districts \"ensure that all staff and students, including students with disabilities, homeless students, and English language learners, have the necessary devices at home for virtual education days, including access to Wifi.\"\nProviding equitable access to these services can be challenging during virtual instruction, district officials said.\nCaroline County has 576 multilingual learners, 569 individualized education program students and 116 students who experience homelessness. For these students, hands-on teacher engagement and preparation is required for proper learning.\n\"It's very hard to keep students engaged, especially for four hours of synchronous instruction,\" Erica McDonald, supervisor of special education, said. \"Without that in-person tangible motivating things that can keep them engaged during instruction, it can lead to increased frustration.\"\nProviding necessary technologies and translation services are also complicated by virtual instruction, the officials said.\nTeacher, staff negotiations\nSome district employees work on inclement weather days, and some staff members do not work and still get paid, district officials said.\nRequirements of the state say, \"during virtual inclement weather days the local school system shall offer public school employees who are not assigned to work during the virtual education day an opportunity to make up the lost work through other duties before the beginning of the next school year.\"\nThe district would be responsible for determining how this work would be made up.\nVirtual learning days require additional planning from teachers, which requires a negotiation with the teachers' union for proper pay.\n\"Our teachers work really hard. We all know are teachers work outside of hours. We have all come to accept that it comes with the job,\" Dr. Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services said. \"However, the law does say that we may negotiate with our teachers' union. They have a right to come to negotiate if there is extra work here we would like extra compensation for that.\"\nAfter going through the presentation, Simmons concluded it would be to hard for the county to pull off virtual inclement weather days.\n\"I don't see how as a county, with the resources we have right now, that this puts us in a great position to be able to hit all the marks to be able to pull this off effectively to meet all requirements,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A decade before that, he lived on the western shore of Maryland as the CEO of the Maryland Pennysaver.\nIn 2010, Baez entered the news industry when he took a job with Tribune Publishing Company in Newport News, Virginia.\n\"I joined newspapers in 2010 and have been with them ever since,\" he said.\nAs regional president, Baez will oversee the Chesapeake market.\n\"I'm excited,\" he said about his new role. \"Adams is a great company. They've been really good to me.\"\nBaez — who won the first ever APG Regional President of the Year award in 2021 — said one of his favorite company memories is when the company asked him for his opinion and they supported him.\n\"And they let me go do that,\" he said. \"That speaks volumes for the kind of culture that the company has.\"\nBefore taking on the new role with APG, Baez was the CEO of TravelHost, a publication connecting businesses with travelers. He said that during his time in the news industry, he's enjoyed getting to connect businesses with audiences that desire the products and services of those businesses.\n\"That's the creative part,\" he said. \"That's the energizing part.\"\nBaez, whose family immigrated to the United States as political exiles from Cuba, said he is a big fan of free speech.\n\"From that standpoint I think journalism plays a great part,\" he said. \"I think journalism has evolved a lot, and we continue to evolve it along with what people want. I think we have to get smarter about how we write (and) what we write about because it is something that we have to eventually monetize to sustain.\"\nAPG CEO and President Mark Adams said in a news release that Baez brings \"familiarity and experience\" to this position.\n\"It's always rewarding when we can have an executive like Orestes return to our organization,\" he said.\nWhen he's not working, Baez can often be found on the pickleball courts. The three-time national champ is currently playing on the pickleball Senior Pro Tour.\nHis love for pickleball blossomed after decades of playing tennis. Since picking up a tennis racket at the age of 9, he has won over 300 tennis doubles titles. While in college, Baez played tennis for Clemson University. He also coached the Clemson team while in graduate school there.\nIt wasn't until he was in his 50s that Baez's friend convinced him to give pickleball a try. Since then, Baez has gone from playing the sport recreationally to playing in tournaments.\nAs he settles into his new role on the Chesapeake, Baez is looking for houses in Annapolis with his wife, Donna. He said he is excited to contribute to the Chesapeake team.\n\"It's about removing obstacles and helping guide,\" he said about his role. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline’s in Denton making strides in new owners tenure\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Caroline \n \n 512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Caroline's in Denton has been open for just about nine months under new owners and in that time has seen increased following on social media and increase revenues.Owner and Executive Chef Ken Zellers and his wife, Robin Zellers, have ideas to take Caroline's in Denton to the next level. They will be putting a permanent food truck at a new brewery in Denton called Eden Town Brewing Company.\n\"We purchased the food trailer out back, so we're going to be doing the food at the brewery, putting the trailer over there, next step of expansion,\" Zellers said.\nThis next step in expansion brings hopes for Caroline's in Denton to keep growing.\n\"That's a scary part of getting in the restaurant industry,\" Zellers said. \"You never know how the community is going to take to you, how they're going to like your food, your drinks and what you're doing, but it seems to be working out pretty well.\"\nZeller took over ownership from previous owner Nancy Minahan, Zeller interviewed multiple times for the chef position at Caroline's in Denton but was never granted the opportunity, until Minahan called him about buying the restaurant.\nZeller started working at a restaurant at just 14 years old and began cooking at 16 years old and running a kitchen at 18 years old. He is an award-winning chef in Anna Arundel County including best chef of the year just last year.\nOne thing Zellers has done since taking ownership of Caroline's in Denton is tweaking the menu away from fine dinning to more affordable menu with high quality ingredients.\nZellers keeps the high quality ingredients by serving fresh farm to table items on the menu, fresh farm items that come from Caroline County and other counties across the Mid-Shore.\n\"Ingredients is always the No. 1 thing,\" Zellers said.\nStarting with a good ingredient is important, he said, plus it supports the local economy and the community, not to mention local farms.\n\"I think that's the biggest thing like just the quality of the ingredient. You just put that on the plate and let it shine, and you don't have to do much to it,\" Zellers said. \"I think it's a big part of why people have taken to our food so so much because we really can't mess it up because the flavor's there.\"\nThe Zellers have added an enclosure onto the porch for extra seating for the winter and summer days. Next to the restaurant is Caroline's side bar which features outside and inside seating with a different menu than Caroline's in Denton. Zellers called the outdoor seating \"beautiful.\"\nWith plans of more expansion, Zellers says the love and growth Caroline's in Denton has seen still hasn't hit home for him yet.\n\"This is always going to be the baby, we're always going to make sure this is taken care of, but it's just like I said, I don't think it's hit me,\" Zellers said. \"I could have never imagined especially a restaurant that's this beautiful that I would be the owner of it, but I fell in love with when I first interviewed with Nancy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County ballot questions will not take effect due to 'administrative error'\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 454\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Although Dorchester County voters who took to the polls in November voted on whether changes should be made to the county charter, those changes will not be made this year.During a Dorchester County Council meeting on March 4, Council President Lenny Pfeffer announced the county had made an \"administrative error\" by not advertising the referendum questions for five consecutive weeks after the council approved them.\n\"With it not being advertised correctly per state law, it would not make those referendum questions valid to change the charter,\" Pfeffer said.\nThe error in advertising was an accident, Pfeffer said, and he apologized to county residents.\n\"As far as blame for this, this entire (council) and Dorchester County takes general responsibility for this mistake,\" he said.\nPfeffer said the error was discovered in the process of reclaiming the county's sanitary district. He said that during the bond review process, legal counsel for the bond review discovered the oversight.\nPfeffer said the county waited for additional legal review before telling the public.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat March 5, Pfeffer said the council was notified of the error a little over a month ago. He said the county had previously been trying to have the amendments made to the charter by spring.\nIn November, county residents voted to amend four parts of the county charter. The changes amended the charter to:\nHave the review of administrative structure be conducted within the first fiscal year of each Dorchester County Council term. Currently, the charter says a review of administrative structure should take place at least every four years, but it does not state when in that four years it should take place.Push back budget-related due dates 15 days.Clarify responsibilities of the county manager, including day-to-day operations, and establish procedures for certain vacancies. Currently, the charter has procedures in place for council member and treasurer vacancies, as well as certain board and commission vacancies.Include language to ensure transparency of governmental functions as well as access to open meetings and public records.\nPfeffer said although these amendments cannot be made to the charter now, they could be voted on again in future elections.\n\"So it will be up to the wishes of the Charter Review Commission and the council before the next election on if any one, all of, or whatever list of referendum questions could get placed on the ballot next time,\" he said.\nDorchester County Attorney Chip MacLeod said the county is looking into whether the ballot questions that were approved by voters could be addressed through county code or policy changes.\nMacLeod called the situation \"unfortunate,\" but made it clear other opportunities might exist.\n\"One way or another, the county's going to be impacted by those charter amendments, even though they're not technically valid,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Department of Aging funding anticipated to remain flat, secretary says\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: General Assembly \n \n 443\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Funding for the Maryland Department of Aging is expected to remain flat over the coming year, according to Maryland Secretary of Aging Carmel Roques.The secretary's comment came after Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) asked if there were concerns about the department's budget outcome during an Eastern Shore Delegation meeting Friday morning.\nConcerns are not with losing funding, but with an anticipated inability to grow funding.\n\"The okay news is we don't anticipate our funding to be cut, but we're not going to have additional funding,\" Roques said. \"And the way we're going to try and make that a better situation is the way we engage with, in a collaborative fashion, … our health and our housing agencies.\"\nThe majority of the department's funding comes from the federal government. State funding comprises a smaller portion of the dollars the department has to distribute.\nIn fiscal year 2024, Upper Shore Aging, the designated area agency on aging for Talbot, Caroline and Kent counties, received almost $782,000 from the state Department of Aging.\nQueen Anne's County received about $333,000, and Cecil County received roughly $554,000.\nMAC Inc., which is the area agency for Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties, received just over $1.3 million.\nKnowing the funding was unlikely to grow, the department took steps early on to maximize the funding available to direct it more effectively at the local level, Roques said.\nThose steps included working with stakeholder groups to look at three state programs — subsidized assisted living, congregate living and senior care money — to think about redesigning the long-term services and supports system in place from the state funding.\nAccording to Roques, the work being done now will not \"dramatically\" change anything about fiscal year 2025, but it will in the coming years.\nThe Administration on Community Living, a federal agency that increases access to community supports for older adults and those with disabilities, also recently changed regulations to include guidance that will impact equity, she said.\nRoques said the update to the regulations is \"good news\" for the rural elderly population, their families and care providers.\nThe state's rural communities have the highest populations of adults age 50 and older, according to data shared during her presentation.\nThe rural counties on the Eastern Shore have some of the highest numbers. In 2020, 50.8% of Talbot County's population was over age 50.\nMaryland's overall population is rapidly growing older. In the next six years, the state will see more residents over 60 than under 18 — a first, Roques said.\n\"...What's being baked into that guidance is that rural communities need to be more heavily weighted in the formula for distribution of funds to recognize that their challenges are very different,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the business website, Matt and Sarah dreamed of building a family business in Denton for many years.\n\"My wife was born and raised here in Denton. We lived in North Carolina for a while, which is where I'm from, and down there, there's lots of breweries,\" Matt Dahl said. \"We saw how much people loved breweries as a place to just come and get a beer or just hang out with friends and family.\n\"So, we moved back up here, we knew that Denton didn't have a brewery. The more research we did, we realized really that there's not that many breweries in the entire region. We saw what breweries did for the towns that did have them. It's becomes an attraction. So that's really what we're hoping this brewery is going to bring people into Denton.\"\nThe brewery plans to serve multiple different types of beer, including India pale ales, pale ales, pilsners, lagers and much more. They will also provide cocktails and wine.\n\"We want to have something for for everyone,\" Dahl said. \"Not everyone likes every type of beer, so you got to have a variety.\"\nEden Town will also partner with Caroline's in Denton to provide a full service food truck. Dahl loved the idea of partnering with a local business to provide food.\n\"We love it because that's why we're doing it,\" Dahl said. \"We' haven't even opened yet, and we have all already created a partnership with another business here in town that I think is going to help both of us.\"\nIn addition to an in-house brewery that guests will be able to see from the tap room, Eden Town Brewing will also have an event room.\n\"This is an area that people will be able to rent. If they have a private party, we have to close it off,\" Dahl said. \"If they've got a kind of larger party, we can open this door up, and they can have part of the yard.\"\nEden Town Brewing Company has land that can be utilized for bigger events and for making the brewery a family friendly place were people can bring their kids to play. Owners also plan to sell Eden Town Brewing Company merch. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC | Section: News \n \n 332\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Lenten season begins today, a day called Ash Wednesday.Ashes are a sign of mortality and repentance. The uses of ashes dates back to ancient Jewish tradition and often were associated with sacrifices, mourning and fasting. A person would properly express grief, humiliation and repentance sitting in ashes or placing them on the head.\nAt one time, during the early centuries of the church, public penitents at Rome were ceremonially admitted on this day to begin their penance.\nThis ceremony fell into disuse between the eighth and 10th centuries as general penance of the entire congregation began to take place. This penance was symbolized through the imposition of ashes.\nAnother use for ashes in the early church (second century) included a regular ceremony of public confession and penance. This use had acquired so much significance that Tertullian (a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa) spoke of \"the substitution of sackcloth and ashes for a man's usual habit.\"\nToday, ashes symbolize the same meanings though the ceremonial customs have vanished. The one exception to this is Ash Wednesday.\nThe word \"Lent\" derives from the anglo-saxon term lencten, meaning \"spring.\" During this time we earnestly recount all that God accomplished through the work of Jesus Christ.\nWe experience this period every year in the life of the church, but often, we forget, or sometimes we never knew what this time of year is about. Lent as a forty-day period of focus on penitence and preparation for the Resurrection Event of Easter. Today, we tend to observe Lent as a time of penance, by abstaining from festivals, by almsgiving, and by devoting more than the usual time to exercises of the faith. In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on these aspects than the physical fasting that marked this season in the early church.\nI pray that this Lenten season would be a holy and sacred time of preparation for the celebration of the greatest day in human history; the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The study of history is the key to solving the labyrinth of social, economic and political problems we face today.\"\nAt the Starr Center for the American Experience, Thomason works as a digital archiving intern under the supervision of Melissa P. Kemp, the center's digital archivist and historian.\nShe scans, archives and uploads content into the Chesapeake Heartland archive, which features local African American families and their personal collections of family photos, home videos, yearbooks and other mementos they've collected over the years.\n\"I've learned a lot about digital history and its importance, as well as how tedious it can be,\" Thomason said.\nFor Thomason, the rewards of her Starr Center experience are many. \"It's the confidence boost and sense of community that comes from association with professors and students who are just as passionate as I am. At school I feel a sense of belonging and I'm exposed to opportunities that I never knew were available,\" she said.\nShe considers the most challenging aspect of student life as striking a balance between college, work and life. \"I am a unique undergraduate, especially for a Washington College student, because I have a two year old daughter. Most of the students around me at school still live at home or in dorms and are accustomed to only being responsible for themselves and their studies. Commuting from about an hour away, having a little person depending on me, a household to keep up with, and finding time to work has added many struggles that most of my peers do not have to navigate. But I wouldn't change it for the world!\"\nAs the oldest of the Thomason family's five children, Kennedy counts her parents as inspiration.\n\"I remember watching my mother wrangle five children. I learned a lot from my mom and I admire her and look up to her. She and my dad supported all five of us doing five different things. We have always been a very tight-knit family unit with parents who have provided immense support. I could not do what I do without them. They keep my daughter (whose name is Sailor) when I need them to. Our family has always functioned as a unit working towards whatever goal we have, that day, that week, whenever.\"\nWhen her family purchased Denton's Ellen B from Captain Bill Behlke, it was a given that the River City Cruise Company would be a family affair. Thomason immediately planned to add history as part of the river tours.\n\"I love the Choptank River,\" she said.\nAware of the deep historical roots she was certain that many Eastern Shore residents knew of the area's history and wanted to learn more.\n\"I'm a huge proponent of accessibility to history, which means I'm always trying to think of ways to bring history to the public rather than waiting for the public to seek it out,\" she said. \"The river tours are just one aspect of my advocacy.\"\nThe first year of the River City Cruise Company was a great success. \"I had the time of my life on each trip,\" Thomason recalled.\nHer favorite guests were the people who came along for the ride but found themselves fascinated by the stories of the Choptank's history and heritage.\n\"I also loved seeing people from our community learn more about the land. Although I love and appreciate the out-of-towners that come and enjoy everything the Choptank has to offer, seeing locals being able to connect their lives with the past is truly special. One thing that I tell each cruise is there's no reason that people, states or oceans away should know more about our land than us.\"\nThis year, she's revamping the script and expanding the talking points to make each cruise truly unique. \"I never want someone to feel that they came once and can't come again. I always want people to take away something new, even if they've taken the tour ten times.\"\nRecently, Thomason was awarded funds to complete her own Choptank River History project from the Gerda Blumenthal Grant through Washington College's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.\nOver the summer she'll publish a series of blog posts in conjunction with the Caroline County Historical Society's website that will focus on ways the Choptank has shaped the greater Caroline County community.\n\"My motto for the project has been that people tend to think of rivers as borders, but, historically, the Choptank has been the center,\" Thomason said. \"What exactly this project will look like I am still trying to work out, but I am excited about it. I plan on having at least one public event and my research will lead to a more robust history tour.\"\nThis fall Thomason will graduate from Washington College. She's still trying to figure out what she wants to do post-graduation. Whatever she chooses, the study of history will benefit.\nVisit River City Cruise Company on Facebook, email them at riverruncruise@gmail.comor call 410-673-8201. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of these student athletes are amazing young adults. The growth and expansion of our league continues across the Mid-Shore, and we look forward to competing with even more teams next year,\" he said.\nKent Island High School was the first public high school in the state of Maryland to establish a skeet team. With Easton and Queen Anne's recently established clubs, there were finally enough for a tournament, Kent Island Clay Target Team Head Coach Sean Connolly said.\nStudent athletes couldn't be more excited to pit their skills against local schools, he said.\nA non-traditional sport that focuses on hand eye coordination, clay target shooting is an inclusive, unique and growing outlet for kids who might not otherwise compete in sports, he said.\nComing in second overall for the championship was Easton High School, which also won first place in their conference during the Maryland State High School Clay Target League earlier this year, notable as the club is only in its first year, according to Head Coach Joe Cap.\n\"The fact that we've come this far is pretty exceptional,\" he said, \"Practice makes perfect, and the students put in a lot of hard work and a lot of hours. It's very exciting and a long time coming.\"\nThe sport has seen support and sponsorship from the local community, and the team also does a lot to pay that forward, according to Cap, including visiting county government departments, the sheriff's office, and the Waterfowl Festival.\nSeeking to expand youth shooting sports across Maryland, the skeet coaches are happy to help schools seeking to establish their own clubs.\n\"We have done a lot to grow this sport in a short time, and we aren't done yet. Whoever has interest, we'll help them out,\" Connolly said.\n\"The more teams and the more kids we have, the better for everybody,\" Cap said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board of Directors.The unanimous vote comes more than a year after Jeff Powell, who previously held the seat, resigned from the board. In an interview with the Star Democrat, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Powell resigned from the CWDI board over a year ago when he took on the role of interim county manager.\nAt a Dorchester County Council meeting on Sept. 17, Pfeffer said the county had received an application from Crosby, who is an architect and planner with a firm based in Cambridge.\nIn an interview, Pfeffer said that along with Crosby's professional experience, Crosby is very familiar with the community. Pfeffer said he thinks Crosby will \"represent the true feelings of the citizens of Dorchester County.\"\nNow, the CWDI Board of Directors will have to vote on whether to approve the county's appointment.\nRecently Gaver Nichols and Natalie Chabot were appointed to fill the seats of former city-appointed board members Rich Zeidman and Dion Banks.

    "content": "Mobsters, spies, anarchists, Klan members - and Trump - Prosecutors use racketeering, spy and Reconstruction laws in Trump criminal indictments\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former president Donald Trump has been charged like mobster and drug kingpin in Georgia, like an anarchist and foreign spy in Florida and like a post-Civil War Ku Klux Klan member in Washington D.C. as he faces now a quartet of criminal charges in the run-up to 2024 election.Trump was indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury along with 2024 campaign cohorts and attorneys - including Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows - over attempts to reverse President Joe Biden's 11,779-vote win in the Peach State.Part of that indictment includes racketeering charges conventionally used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs.\"The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia's legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia's presidential election result,\" Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, said during a late-night news conference Monday, Aug. 14, announcing the indictment of the former president and leading 2024 GOP White House candidate.The indictment includes RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations), making false statements and other election meddling charges. The criminal charges to making false statements, like some of other federal allegations against Trump, will face First Amendment free speech counterarguments.Across the U.S., RICO cases have commonly been used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs including John Gotti's Gambino Crime Family, the Hells Angels, Latin Kings and the Cowboy Mafia, which used shrimp boats to smuggle illegal marijuana in the late 1970. There have been RICO charges used in some corporate and other corruption cases including 2022 indictments of some current and former soccer officials associated with FIFA and CONCACAF.In Georgia, RICO convictions could potentially bring prison terms of 5 to 20 years.According to the Associated Press, the Trump indictment includes criminal charges related to \"attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to Trump.\" \"In one particularly brazen episode, it also outlines a plot involving one of his lawyers to access voting machines in a rural Georgia county and steal data from a voting machine company,\" the AP writes.Like with his federal indictments and charges in New York of filing false business claims to cover up alleged hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model, Karen McDougal, Trump lambasted the charges as politically motivated falsehoods aimed to undermining his 2024 White House bid.\"Can you believe it? This failed District Attorney from Atlanta, Fani Willis, where murders and other violent crime soars daily to new record highs, is charging me with 2020 Presidential Election Interference. No, Fani, the only Election Interference was done by those that Rigged and Stole the Election,\" Trump said in a statement on social media platform Truth Social. \"Those are the ones you should be going after, not the innocent people that are fighting for Election Integrity!\" Ellis and Guiliani, who served as Trump campaign lawyers, say they are being charged criminally for providing legal advice. \"The Democrats and the Fulton County DA are criminalizing the practice of law,\" Ellis said in a social media statement.U.S. Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has invoked federal grand juries in Florida and D.C. to indict Trump via the 1917 Espionage Act over his alleged misappropriation of classified documents and a post-Civil War law aimed at violent harassment by the Ku Klux Klan over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and efforts to derail Congress' certification of Biden as the 2020 election winner.The Espionage Act has been previously used against Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Julius and Ethen Rosenbereg and early 20th Century anarchist writer Emma Goldman.All told, Trump, 77, could potentially be jailed for the rest of his life if convicted and sentenced aggressively by state and federal judges.Tung Yin, a law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, said jury selections will be very important in the cases against Trump and prospective jurors may hide their love, disdain or other views toward the former Republican president.\"That person might give very bland answers during jury selection,\" XXX said. \"It would be very hard to ferratt someone like this out. you get one person out of 12 you have a hung jury.\" The timing of the trials could run into and potentially after the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign elections.Yin sees the classified documents case where Trump is accused of improperly taking classified materials from the White House to his Florida estate as the stronger of the federal prosecutions.If convicted, Trump, the leading opposition candidate currently to President Biden, could potentially be jailed.For example, Jan. 6th charges in D.C. (which Biden won over Trump 92% to 5%) could result in Trump going to a federal prison for between 57 to 71 months, according to an estimate from Yin. That's between just under four and almost six years.Politically, as expected, Trump-aligned Republicans criticized the Georgia indictment while Democrats and progressives hailed the effort to convict and potentially imprison the bombastic populist former president. \n \n Caption: CHARLIE NEIBERGALL\n \nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump greets supporters at the Iowa Pork Producers tent during a visit to the Iowa State Fair, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa.\n \nJOHN BAZEMORE\n \nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks in the Fulton County Government Center during a news conference, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, in Atlanta.

Former Gov. Larry Hogan is running for the open U.S. Senate seat and stopped in Easton Friday to talk with people at the service center.He visited the facility on 126 Port Street and asked questions.\nThe Responsible Father Initiative, founded by Corey Pack and co-facilitated by Lou Dorsey, is an outreach program to help men become better fathers. It is a nonprofit and is all confidential. It provides food, clothing and first month's rent to people in need. These men gave Hogan the tour of the center.\nPack spoke to the governor about what they teach.\n\"We go over what is called the three E's. Emotion, energy and expression. And we talk about effective listening skills,\" Pack said. \"We run through the 7/38/55 rule. 7% of the way we communicate is verbally. 38% is with our tone and 55% is with our body language.\"\nThe governor listened closely.\n\"I did not realize that,\" Hogan said. \"That is an important lesson for me to learn.\"\nHe listened to more about the program.\n\"We try to develop more nurturing and caring fathers in this program. Most of the guys grew up in a home without a father. Some have been incarcerated with no contact with their children. It is great for them to see their children and establish a relationship with their children,\" Dorsey said.\nHogan recognized that a lot of men needed these services and saluted their dedication to helping these men flourish.\n\"It sounds like you guys are doing really important work here,\" Hogan said.\nOne of the Neighborhood Service Center workers asked Hogan to run for president. He smiled.\nHogan toured spaces intended for children. Then he went into the kitchen and in another room saw where they store clothes to give away.\nAt the end of tour, he was give two T-shirts and a coffee mug that touted the Neighborhood Service Center.\nAfter his visit he stopped to do an interview in the parking lot. Hogan said his campaign is focused on the economy and crime.\n\"We are meeting voters every day,\" he said. \"The people of Maryland know me after eight years of being governor.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The gentleman knew me by my nickname, and I quickly became a good listener. Trying to place the voice it took me a few minutes to realize who it was a long-time multigenerational family friend. Let's call him Mike. I would later reflect on what an honor it was for me.For the better part of an hour, he regaled me with stories of yesteryear (none, surprisingly, set in the famed bygone watering hole of that name), featuring my father, grandfather and great-grandfather. My eyes swelled as he began to bring the good old days back to life, first in black and white, then in color. Some stories I had had a taste of, but most were new to me. What gentlemen they were.\nI share that story to preface this one. While enjoying the company of \"The Thursday Brotherhood\" the topic of today's social climate came up. All of our comments were true and valid in their own way; I can only imagine that each generation feels the same, that in any moment in history, there are good times and not-so-good times.\nThe conversation brought back memories of my great-grandfather Walter Wood; he was the chief of police for then little old Easton. He called it \"my town,\" and used his platform to serve with understanding as only he could. One quality of old Walter I heard about more than a few times was his sensible approach to life. My dad called it his C.S. (common sense) degree.\nAs it goes, he would leave home after supper, head to the firehouse, and open the door to the locals who needed shelter for the night. Today, we call them homeless. He would lock the door and call it a night. In the morning, the routine played out in reverse. What a novel solution.\nToday, we share the same challenges as our predecessors, updated for the 21st century. How we approach them and resolve them is up to us, let's call it perspective. Sometimes what is old is what's new again. Having a bit more compassion and understanding for our neighbors can't be all wrong. Just maybe if we all use our C.S. degrees a bit more, we can all wake up and go to sleep with a smile.\nROO WOOD\nWittman \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "City of Cambridge confirms Dri-Dock Recovery and Wellness Center can be in new location\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The City of Cambridge has determined that, under the city's zoning requirements, Dri-Dock Recovery and Wellness Center is allowed at its new location on Maryland Avenue.The center's move from 524 Race St to 103 Maryland Ave caused city officials and Cambridge residents alike to question whether the new location is consistent with the city's zoning code.\nThe Dorchester County Health Department, which runs the center, did not receive a zoning certificate from the city before moving to 103 Maryland Ave.\nThe center provides recovery support, advocacy and a substance-free environment. According to the County Health Department, it is a place that those recovering from a substance use disorder or mental health disorder can go for voluntary and free services.\n\"We're there to help people and to try and help resolve problems that arise in the area,\" Donald Hall, the county's director of behavioral health, said about what Dri-Dock does.\nHall said Dri-Dock opened its doors on Maryland Avenue on Jan. 22. The center plans to have a grand opening, where people can come in and ask questions, once it is fully unpacked.\nWhile Dri-Dock settles into its new digs, the city has been reviewing whether the Health Department properly followed the city's zoning requirements.\nCambridge City Manager Tom Carroll said that although the Health Department shouldn't have moved without a zoning certificate, the city believes the center is permitted in its new location.\nTo come to this answer, Carroll said it was a matter of determining exactly what the space is used for and whether it complies with the city's zoning requirements.\nIf the city had determined the center was not in compliance with zoning requirements, Carroll said the city would have taken action.\nGene Lauer, who is on Cambridge's Planning and Zoning Commission, said he was surprised to learn that Dri-Dock had moved its location.\nBefore learning of the city's determination in regard to zoning, Lauer said in an interview that he had looked through the permitted uses for the district that the new location of Dri-Dock is zoned in. He said he did not see that clinics or treatment clinics were permitted.\nCarroll said that after the city met with the Health Department, it became clear that the center is essentially being used as an office for peer counseling.\nHall said the center does not keep medications on the premises or give medications out on-site.\nLauer said checking zoning should be one of the first steps when it comes to moving a business.\n\"Because there are no guarantees after that,\" he said.\nHall said the Health Department had reached out to the city before moving, providing its license and asking what it needed to do to \"expedite the situation.\"\n\"That response was a little slow getting back to us,\" he said. \"So we ended up having to move.\"\nBeing a part of government, the Health Department did everything they could to meet all the laws and regulations, Hall said.\nThe move to Maryland Avenue has been two years in the making for Dri-Dock. Because the center was on the second floor at its Race Street location, it didn't meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, Hall said.\nAlong with that, the center experienced issues with leaking, heating and cooling and plumbing at the Race Street location.\nCONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY\nHall said he has heard concerns from residents that Dri-Dock's move to Maryland Avenue could affect property values. He said that he understands the concern, but doesn't think this will be an issue.\n\"We are very conscious that we are in a community,\" he said.\nIn a Jan. 22 letter to his constituents, Commissioner Brian Roche expressed concerns with the new location's \"visibility and exposure,\" bringing up the city's comprehensive plan — a plan that establishes the city's goals to guide growth and development in an \"environmentally sustainable manner\" in Cambridge.\nRoche said the comprehensive plan discourages facilities like Dri-Dock from being in retail storefronts on the city's gateways and in its \"downtown commercial core.\"\nCarroll said the comprehensive plan guides the city's Unified Development Code.\n\"If there is a disconnect between the Unified Development Code and the Comprehensive Plan, then we need to amend the code to line up with the comprehensive plan,\" he said. \"The plan is on top, the code follows. And so if there's any inconsistency, you amend what follows.\"\nIn his letter, Roche said the exposure might also be unwanted by those utilizing the center.\n\"I question that the most highly visible public storefronts in our city are suitable locations for those seeking medically and behaviorally sensitive, personal treatment,\" he wrote.\nRoche also mentioned crime as a concern, saying that there had been a \"significant number\" of complaints and criminal activity at the center's prior location of 524 Race Street. He attached a police report to his letter that lists the 30 calls for service from Aug. 1, 2021 to Nov. 30, 2023.\nAcknowledging the move was a recent one, Hall said that since Dri-Dock has moved to Maryland Avenue, people haven't been \"lingering in the area.\" He said the goal of Dri-Dock is to help the community.\n\"Our target population is Dorchester County residents,\" he said. \"These aren't folks who are being bussed in. These are people who live in the community, who walk those streets everyday.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's a no-brainer.Here are my top handy recipes to help you get started saving all that money you've been spending on cleaners:EYEGLASSES CLEANING SOLUTIONFill a spray bottle of any size 3/4 full with 70 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol (91 or 99 percent are fine to use but more costly and not necessary).Add 2 small drops of mild dishwashing liquid (Blue Dawn is ideal), and fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (see note).Add the spray top, and gently shake the bottle by rolling it between your hands or on a countertop, so as to not create a lot of bubbles. To use: Spray both sides of your lenses, and gently rub them clean with a clean microfiber cloth.WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUIDPour 3 cups rubbing alcohol, 1 tablespoon Blue Dawn and 10 cups distilled water into a 1-gallon plastic jug. Shake thoroughly to mix. Pour into your car windshield washer reservoir in place of commercial windshield washer fluid. Always shake prior to adding to the reservoir.The alcohol speeds the drying time and prevents the windows from freezing or cracking in the winter.Mary Hunt invites you to visit her at Everyday-Cheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.

Peter & Paul head coach Debbie McQuaid said after the Sabres improved to 10-2 with their fourth straight victory, the last three by shutout.Webb gained possession of the ball from about 25 yards away from Easton's cage near the 4-minute mark of the first period. She circled left, then moved right before unloading a hard drive from the left side that got past Warrior goalie Alli Newman before banging into the far right corner of the cage.\"My teammates basically helped us all get up the field,\" Webb said. \"I just took it and I don't know what really happened.I was just really determined to get that goal. I knew I had to get off a shot real quickly. I just hit it and it went in. I was really shocked.\" Easton (5-4) earned two of its nine penalty corners in the final 1:15 of the first quarter, getting one shot off that was wide of the mark. Both teams each picked up one corner in the second quarter, but could not capitalize.The game remained even through the third, as the Warriors picked up three more corners, with Easton's Bis Johnson firing wide left.Sts. Peter & Paul had one corner in the third, with Gennie Webb shooting wide right.\"They came out and they scored on us, and it was a beautiful goal,\" said Easton head coach Kim Neff, whose team lost its second straight by shutout. \"I do feel like the rest of the game we picked up our pace, we had good passing.I felt like our defense and middies played a really great game.\"They just struck first and we just couldn't capitalize on our opportunities,\" Neff continued.\"We had plenty of corners. We had plenty of shots. We just couldn't put it in today.\" The Sabres earned their fourth and final corner with 11 minutes remaining but didn't managed anything on goal. Easton had two more corner chances, the last with a minute remaining but could not get the equalizer.\"We really had the determination to win,\" Sts. Peter & Paul's Jules Stepp said. \"They're our friends, and even though they're our friends, we like to have our friendly competition with them.\"I really think we communicated well and we looked up and we passed to each other,\" Stepp continued. \"And we played a little bit of short and long ball together. And our defense, every time they got the opportunity to get the ball they cleared it out to the side and they recovered. They were on their 'A' game today.\" But McQuaid thought it took a little while for that 'A' game to materialize.\"Defense held solid,\" said McQuaid after goalie Maddie Maloney and company registered their sixth shutout of the season. \"They were a little befuddled in the first half and not marking the way they were supposed to.

Executive Director Matt Leonard sees the lawsuit filed earlier this month against CWDI by the Commissioners of Cambridge as a threat to the progress of the Cambridge Harbor project.\"We had no choice but to respond,\" Leonard said in a press release May 14. \"The city's lawsuit has its facts wrong and threatens the significant progress CWDI is making on behalf of the community to finally realize the 30-year vision for Cambridge's waterfront.\"\nOn May 14, CWDI and CWDI Holdings filed a response to the lawsuit filed against them and Yacht Maintenance Company in Dorchester County Circuit Court on May 1.\nThe lawsuit, which was amended May 3, alleges CWDI is in violation of a transfer agreement it entered into with the city in June 2021. It seeks $75,000 in damages and requests temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping defendants from transferring any portion of the property in violation of the covenants of the 2021 transfer agreement.\nAccording to court documents, CWDI's May 14 response to the suit argues that the city's complaint \"is the product of the well-publicized frustrations of the recently departed city manager,\" Tom Carroll. The response alleges Carroll has \"sought to undermine CWDI\" for the past eight months.\nCWDI's response replies to the commissioners' claims about the property transfer agreement and the right of CWDI Holdings to be in possession of the property.\nIn the lawsuit filed May 1, the commissioners mention Section 6E of the transfer agreement, which states, \"no portion of the property may be transferred unless the proposed use of the subject parcel(s) is 'shovel ready' (with permits, financing and groundbreaking within 90-days of closing)...\"\nThe May 1 suit also mentions Exhibit C of the agreement that \"CWDI will not transfer, subdivide or encumber all or any portion of the property\" until reaching a definitive agreement with a developer or developers. That developer must come from a developer request for proposal process, which is outlined in the transfer agreement.\nThe commissioners argue in the May 1 lawsuit that CWDI violated this in March 2022 by transferring city-donated property to CWDI Holdings, a limited liability company.\nCWDI states in its response that the city and CWDI agreed to CWDI creating CWDI Holdings to hold title to property named in the property transfer agreement. CWDI also states this was agreed to in a 2022 amendment to a 2014 state transfer agreement.\nIn response to city allegations that CWDI has not gone through the request for proposal process to choose a developer, CWDI alleges in court documents that Exhibit C of the transfer agreement gives leeway to seek a master developer or combination of individual project developers for all or parts of the Cambridge Harbor project. CWDI states it issued a request for proposals, called \"Request for Expressions of Interest for Redevelopment,\" on July 15 and issued a press release Nov. 22 summarizing proposals it had received.\nIn its response, CWDI discusses its plans to sell a piece of property from the 2021 transfer agreement to Yacht Maintenance. In the court document, CWDI states that it has been transparent with its intentions regarding Yacht Maintenance. It says CWDI would \"routinely\" update the city on the status of negotiations to convey the property to Yacht Maintenance.\nCWDI's response states that the lot line revision needed for the sale of the property had been finalized and executed by both parties and delivered to Cambridge's Planning and Zoning Department on April 29.\n\"CWDI cannot conceive of any legitimate explanation why, more than two weeks later, the document has not yet been signed and recorded,\" the court document says.\nThe press release — sent out the same day as the response was filed — states CWDI is tasked with developing the waterfront using a \"community-first approach consistent with the community's long-term vision. It says the realization of that vision is threatened by the city's actions.\nThe press release says the city eliminated \"baseless claims\" that CWDI illegally transferred property from its amended lawsuit on May 3.\n\"Someone advising the city commissioners must have finally read all the transfer documents, and not just the one the city used in their original filing,\" CWDI Board President Angie Hengst said. \"So they pulled that claim in their amended filing.\"\nThe press release also states that the amended lawsuit does not contain language asserting there could not be an imminent hotel deal.\nThe lawsuit filed May 1 mentions CWDI's \"imminent\" agreement with a boutique hotel developer, which Hengst said was nearing signing at a CWDI Board of Directors meeting March 20. The lawsuit states it is \"highly unlikely\" that the deal is imminent because \"any established hotelier would conduct significant due diligence,\" which includes inquiring the city about various aspects of the project. The lawsuit says the city has not received any inquiries.\n\"Whoever advised the city commissioners that there was no way CWDI could have a hotel deal ready to sign clearly has no idea how property development works or community development or economic development,\" Leonard said in the press release.\nHengst said that with CWDI's response to the lawsuit filed May 14, the board hopes the city commissioners have all of the facts to withdraw the lawsuit \"and return to a more collaborative path with us and the other partners.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Across from the entrance to the complex is an open field about the size of a football field.For most of the years that we have lived here that field was left in its natural state. That meant lots of wild flowers (chicory, daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, Joe Pye, milkweed, etc.).Also birds were among the inhabitants, especially redwing blackbirds, as well as many butterflies (swallowtails, monarchs, buckeyes, fritillaries, cabbage whites, blues, morning cloaks).Now twice a year it is mowed down to an ugly field of clumps of vegetation.And why? So I can see the bypass.To destroy such a natural magnet for native flowers, butterflies and birds makes a mockery of leadership that professes to care about the environment.My question is: What government agencies make this decision - town, county or state?

While a handful of the speakers indicated support for the sticker removal, many expressed opposition.\nSheri Tardio of Prince Frederick called the issue \"manufactured outrage. Safe space stickers do not promote ideology. Diversity is a fact.\"\n\"You are not hiding your biases very well,\" said Stacy Tayman, president of the Calvert Association for Educational Support Staff.\n\"Removing stickers is not a violation of First Amendment rights,\" said school board President Jana Post in her closing comments, adding that the April discussion \"was twisted\" into an LGBTQ issue.\n\"Real safety comes from a culture of trust,\" Post said.\nAt the conclusion of public comments, board member Paul Harrison made a motion to discuss \"a flag policy\" at a future meeting. That policy would likely be aimed at setting parameters for displays of flags, posters and decals in school buildings. The motion passed unanimously.\nSupervisor's post\nThe school board unanimously approved the appointment of Marc Watson as supervisor of health, physical education and athletics. The Indiana University of Pennsylvania graduate is a familiar face in Calvert County where he has previously served as a teacher, coach and principal.\nMost recently, Watson served as principal of King George High School in Virginia.\nWatson told the board he was looking forward to \"continuing to create this wonderful environment of learning and athletics\" in Calvert County.\nIn recommending Watson for the appointment, Townsel said the returning administrator will provide \"training and mentorship for coaches.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Combined, the projects are projected to generate 15 gigawatts of clean energy, half of Biden's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind-produced energy by 2030.\nThe Maryland project includes up to 114 wind turbines, four offshore substation platforms and a meteorological tower. There will be three phases to the US Wind project, two of which — called MarWin and Momentum Wind — have already received offshore renewable energy certificates from the state.\nEnergy is set to start flowing in December 2028 from the first phase of the project. The final project is expected to be completed in late 2027 or early 2028, according to the plan submitted by US Wind.\nThe approval is a win for Maryland environmental groups and the state government, which have been working for offshore wind power in the state for around 10 years.\nStarting in 2013, the Maryland legislature passed a series of bills to set offshore wind energy projects in motion.\nThe state set a goal in 2023, through the Promoting Offshore Wind Energy Resources Act, to generate 8.5 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2031.\nThis goal has hit some road bumps along the way, including the withdrawal of Denmark-based Ørsted's planned offshore wind projects in January.\nUS Wind won the competitive lease sale of the 46,970 acres of federal ocean waters in 2014.\n\"By moving away from reliance on dirty fossil fuel energy and building renewable energy, Marylanders will be able to breathe cleaner air and benefit from new clean energy jobs,\" Maryland Sierra Club Chapter Director Josh Tulkin said in a statement Thursday.\nJamie DeMarco, the federal campaigns coordinator for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said in an interview with Capital News Service that the Maryland wind farm is a milestone in moving offshore energy generation forward in Maryland.\n\"This is a huge undertaking to build an entire machine to deploy offshore wind, but once that machine is built, it'll be able to hum and crank out new domestic energy, and clean energy that's going to help us clean the air and meet our climate goals,\" DeMarco said.\nOffshore wind turbines have been coming online across the East Coast, DeMarco said, but this will be the first operational offshore wind facility in Maryland.\nEnvironmental advocates aren't the only celebrating parties. Union officials are touting the jobs set to be created by the wind farm.\nAlmost 2,680 jobs annually over seven years could be created during the development and construction phase of the wind farm, according to the Interior Department.\nUS Wind's planned permanent offshore wind components production facility, called Sparrows Point Steel in Sparrows Point, Baltimore — the former home of Bethlehem Steel — is forecast to generate jobs for steelworkers.\nThe Baltimore Bethlehem Steel mill, which closed in 2012, was once the largest steel producer in the world. Sparrows Point Steel will bring steelworker jobs back to Maryland, DeMarco said, in a way that hasn't been seen since the closure of Bethlehem.\nJim Strong, the offshore wind sector assistant for the United Steelworkers International Union, told CNS Thursday that the facility is expected to bring in over 500 jobs. The project will help not only steelworkers, Strong said, but other union trades as well.\n\"It's about addressing our climate crisis, about creating new green energy jobs — these will be high paid union jobs,\" Strong said.\nStrong has served as a liaison between the union and US Wind. He said that the Sparrows Point facility has the opportunity to become a \"central hub\" for monopile production on the Atlantic Ocean. Monopiles, steel cylinders, are used for wind turbines, bridges and other projects, he said.\nUS Wind is a subsidiary of Italian company Renexia SpA.\nThe project has some detractors, like Rep. Andy Harris (R-Maryland), who represents the Eastern Shore.\n\"Offshore wind industrialization comes at a heavy cost to our marine life and environment, and is an incredibly expensive way to generate electricity,\" Harris said on X in July. \"We should never allow foreign owned companies to control our energy supply — much less harm our environment while doing it.\"\nThe federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's director, Elizabeth Klein, said in a statement that the Maryland project \"reflects the best available science and invaluable insights from Tribes, government agencies, local communities, industry leaders, ocean users, and environmental groups gathered during our extensive environmental review process.\"\n\"As we continue to support the undeniable momentum we see along our coasts, our focus remains on fostering responsible energy development, while protecting marine life and ecosystems,\" she said.\nDemocrats in the state, including Gov. Wes Moore, have been supportive of the project. Moore signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government in June supporting offshore wind production. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hawaiian outrigger canoes making waves in the Chesapeake\n\n February 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEREMY COX Bay Journal | Section: Local News \n \n 631\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Skipjacks, deadrises, log canoes, tall ships, bugeyes — the Chesapeake Bay has no shortage of iconic boats. But if a core group of devotees has anything to do with it, a vessel closely associated with the South Pacific could be next.The outrigger canoe is practically synonymous with Polynesian and Hawaiian cultures. Many Americans of a certain age, though, likely received their notions about outriggers from the closing credits of the original version of the TV crime drama Hawaii Five-O, which showed a sequence of muscly men vigorously paddling through waves.\nThat depiction — of brute strength and more than a whiff of masculinity — continues to loom over the sport of outrigger racing in the popular imagination. But the brand practiced by Maryland's Kent Island Outrigger Canoe Club tends, by intention, toward inclusivity and working in harmony.\n\"People of all ages and abilities can do this,\" said Bill Key, 72, a longtime member. \"You can't screw it up. We're thrilled to have you out here no matter what.\"\nTo that end, during routine club practices, members are often found welcoming newcomers who want to try their hands at the ancient sport. This spring, they hosted a series of outings explicitly geared toward coaxing novices onto the water, with the hope of boosting membership.\nSo, there I was on a Sunday morning in April, standing with a strange-looking paddle in my hands and absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into.\nThe first thing you notice about an outrigger canoe is how long and narrow it is. Single and tandem versions are available. But, like the one in the Hawaii Five-O outro, the craft I boarded could comfortably seat six adults. Most outriggers in this class measure more than 40 feet from stern to bow, roughly the length of a school bus, but the main hull might be a mere 16 inches across.\nThis is where the \"outrigger\" part comes into play. Two arms (iakos in Hawaiian) project from one side of the canoe. These connect to a float (the \"outrigger\" or, in Hawaiian, the ama). Without these second hulls, the vessels would be highly unstable in the open seas.\nNow, let's turn to the paddle. The shaft isn't straight like a traditional canoe oar or kayak paddle; it's slightly bowed, and the blade is angled back a bit to compensate for the bend. At the opposite end of the paddle is a t-shaped handle. Your palm wraps around it, kind of like a bicycle handlebar. Your lower hand should be gripping the shaft just above the blade. It feels more like digging into the water than sweeping through it.\nThe outrigger club here traces its history back 25 years, when John Fulton, who had recently returned to Maryland after a few years living in Hawaii, raised enough money to purchase a communal outrigger canoe.\n\"It's the state sport of Hawaii,\" he said. \"Just about everybody does it.\"\nThe sport has long since migrated to the mainland United States, but its presence on the East Coast remains limited. The nationwide parent organization for outrigger canoe racing chapters lists 70 clubs operating in the three continental states that border the Pacific Ocean. The East Coast boasts a mere 17 clubs.\nThe Kent Island club, the only outrigger group with a Maryland address, counts about three dozen active members. They compete in races up and down the East Coast and host their own event over Labor Day weekend, a 35-mile relay race in which paddlers circumnavigate Kent Island.\nFrom what I could gather, outrigger canoe racing tends to attract experienced standup paddleboarders or kayakers looking for a team environment.\n\"This is a great way (to) get out on the water with people who become your friends,\" said longtime member Nancy Wallace. \"I think I knew one person when I first started. It becomes a family.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Caps fill void, acquire Thompson\n\n June 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: News \n \n 751\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Tampa Bay Lightning and Washington Capitals were active Saturday during rounds 2-7 of the NHL draft, each making multiple moves to shake up their rosters for next season and beyond.Tampa Bay sent two-time Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Mikhail Sergachev to Utah and depth forward Tanner Jeannot to Los Angeles in moves that cleared more than $11 million in salary cap space. That could be enough money to keep captain and face of the franchise Steven Stamkos or make a significant free agent signing, and it will go a long way to providing room to lock up cornerstone defenseman Victor Hedman with a long-term contract extension.\nThe Lightning got younger on the blue line by receiving 24-year-old defenseman J.J. Moser, along with forward prospect Conor Geekie and two draft picks for Sergachev, who was signed through 2031 making $8.5 million annually. A 2025 second-rounder and a fourth this year allows Tampa Bay to restock its prospect pool after making eight consecutive playoff appearances, winning two titles and reaching the final three times.\nThat contending window remains wide open, and general manage Julien BriseBois now has flexibility to retool on the fly with free agency opening Monday. Stamkos staying is a possibility, and now the Lightning have the opportunity to pursue one or more of the top wingers available, a group that includes Jake Guentzel, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Marchessault.\nThe Capitals already did their big-name hunting last week by acquiring highly paid center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Kings for goaltender Darcy Kuemper. On Saturday, they filled that void in net by acquiring Logan Thompson from host Vegas for a pair of third-round picks.\nThompson figures to split time with Charlie Lindgren in a tandem costing less than $2 million total next season, with a year left on each goalie's contract. Thompson, 27, was an All-Star and played 37 games for the Golden Knights during their 2022-23 championship run before getting injured before the playoffs.\n\"I got a lot more that I can prove in this league and I'm hoping that I get that opportunity with Washington,\" said Thompson, who was in bed when he was informed of the trade and hurried to the Sphere for a previously scheduled autograph signing. \"Actually, it was a good alarm clock. I woke up to that and then obviously get ready and come down, and I knew it was going to be an interesting day.\"\nLong before getting his name engraved on the Stanley Cup, Thompson got his first foray into the NHL Capitals development camp in the summer of 2018. He played for Washington at back-to-back prospect showcases, went to training camp with the American Hockey League's Hershey Bears in 2019, starred for the ECHL's South Carolina and earned his first contract as a result.\n\"I'm thankful for the Washington goalie department every day,\" Thompson told The Associated Press at 2023 All-Star Weekend. \"They're the reason why I'm here. They're the only team that gave me a chance three years ago. If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here today.\"\nWashington also traded fourth-line winger Beck Malenstyn to Buffalo for the 43rd pick, taking U.S.-born defenseman Cole Hutson, and traded up in the third round to select Ilya Protas, the younger brother of Capitals forward Aliaksei Protas. Malenstyn, 26, is a restricted free agent with arbitration rights who had 21 points in 81 games during his first full NHL season and gives the Sabres Buffalo valuable forward depth as they try to end the league's longest playoff drought.\nLooking to end the longest Stanley Cup drought, the Toronto Maple Leafs took a step toward upgrading their defense by acquiring the rights to pending free agent Chris Tanev from Dallas for a 2026 seventh-round pick. The trade gives Toronto the first crack at signing the valuable 24-year-old top-four defenseman.\nVegas moved quickly to replenish goalie depth by acquiring Akira Schmid from New Jersey along with young forward Alexander Holtz in a trade that sent Paul Cotter and a third-rounder to the Devils. Among the other moves, St. Louis traded Kevin Hayes and a '25 second-rounder to Pittsburgh for future considerations to shed the remainder of the his contract, and Boston sent Jakob Lauko to Minnesota for Vinni Lettieri in a swap of centers that also involved draft picks.\nThe Sabres after getting Malenstyn began the process of buying out the contract of forward Jeff Skinner, GM Kevyn Adams confirmed at the conclusion of the draft. The buyout saves Buffalo $7.5 million next season while spreading out money owed to Skinner against the cap through 2030. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Lawson Jr., an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutal reactions from white authorities as the Civil Rights Movement gained traction, has died, his family said Monday. He was 95.His family said Lawson died on Sunday after a short illness in Los Angeles, where he spent decades working as a pastor, labor movement organizer and university professor.\nLawson was a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who called him \"the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.\"\nLawson met King in 1957, after spending three years in India soaking up knowledge about Mohandas K. Gandhi's independence movement. King would travel to India himself two years later, but at the time, he had only read about Gandhi in books.\nThe two Black pastors — both 28 years old — quickly bonded over their enthusiasm for the Indian leader's ideas, and King urged Lawson to put them into action in the American South.\nLawson soon led workshops in church basements in Nashville, Tennessee, that prepared John Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, the Freedom Riders and many others to peacefully withstand vicious responses to their challenges of racist laws and policies.\nLawson's lessons led Nashville to become the first major city in the South to desegregate its downtown, on May 10, 1960, after hundreds of well-organized students staged lunch-counter sit-ins and boycotts of discriminatory businesses.\nLawson's particular contribution was to introduce Gandhian principles to people more familiar with biblical teachings, showing how direct action could expose the immorality and fragility of racist white power structures.\nGandhi said \"that we persons have the power to resist the racism in our own lives and souls,\" Lawson told the AP. \"We have the power to make choices and to say no to that wrong. That's also Jesus.\"\nYears later, in 1968, it was Lawson who organized the sanitation workers strike that fatefully drew King to Memphis. Lawson said he was at first paralyzed and forever saddened by King's assassination.\n\"I thought I would not live beyond 40, myself,\" Lawson said. \"The imminence of death was a part of the discipline we lived with, but no one as much as King.\"\nStill, Lawson made it his life's mission to preach the power of nonviolent direct action.\n\"I'm still anxious and frustrated,\" Lawson said as he marked the 50th anniversary of King's death with a march in Memphis. \"The task is unfinished.\"\nCivil rights activist Diane Nash was a 21-year-old college student when she began attending Lawson's Nashville workshops, which she called life-changing.\n\"His passing constitutes a very great loss,\" Nash said. \"He bears, I think, more responsibility than any other single person for the civil rights movement of Blacks being nonviolent in this country.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cookbooks and salt-glazed pottery also were sold.Retired middle school teacher Andy House of Bowie has been a volunteer since 2001, but has served as one of a handful of volunteer millers for about six years. He welcomed the low humidity that affects both the wooden structures and the grain.\"When everything works, it's a relaxing place to be,\" House said. \"It's working perfectly today.\" Local vendors set up tents and displays outdoors on the tree-shaded lawn, and volunteers sold homemade baked goods indoors. Local honey, grass-fed beef, wines and produce were on sale.Old Wye Mill is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday and 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday, May through October.

    "content": "Towns need to balance pride in past with future\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRANDON WRIGHT | Section: Columns \n \n 805\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, I listened to a webinar about the challenges of planning, land use and economic development in rural areas. Communities frequently struggle to grow and still maintain their character. Balancing economic growth with the community's heritage is among the most significant challenges for elected officials because the two are often intertwined.An industry of consultants has grown up to help communities meet these challenges. Like the consultants, I believe a balance can be reached.\nMaybe I am too much of an optimist, but I think opposing groups can find common ground if they are honest and transparent. I served as chief of staff in the Maryland Department of Planning nearly 10 years ago. I met with town council members, county commissioners and local business leaders, all vested in making their communities strong and vibrant. My confidence comes from listening to their hopes, dreams and goals for their communities.\nI met with the consultants, too. Everyone wanted the same for the community — the absolute best.\nCompromises that are in the best interests of all the various constituencies and stakeholders can be forged, even in rural Maryland like the Eastern Shore. There is no place like it. Its ecosystems and economies are different, even from other rural parts of the state. So much of the economy is dependent on the Chesapeake Bay and the rivers that feed into it. It is teeming with myriad species of animals on land and sea.\nThe motto of Federalsburg, my hometown in Caroline County, is \"Pride in the Past, Faith in the Future.\" Unfortunately in towns like Federalsburg, more emphasis is placed on the past than the future. Local officials, sometimes pressured by citizens, have these gauzy memories of a better time and place in the community's past and yearn to get back to it.\nHowever, in doing so, they strip decision-makers of any chance at finding the right balance between the past and future, choking off opportunities to attract large employers, employees and all the businesses that spring up to support them both.\nAs a young boy, I fished for bass and perch on the Marshyhope Creek, the northwest fork of the Nanticoke River. I heard the story that the DuPont Company was looking to build its new nylon factory in the area, and the Marshyhope Creek made Federalsburg an attractive site. Unfortunately, DuPont built its nylon plant on the Nanticoke River in Seaford, Delaware, less than 10 miles from Federalsburg. The plant was constructed outside the town, and Seaford quickly became a company town. The contrast between the two towns is dramatic.\nFederalsburg missed out again, this time on AquaCon. An international salmon farming operation would have brought several hundred well-paying jobs, jobs with health care and all the other benefits that help smooth the rough edges of life. AquaCon would have increased revenue to the town, support for existing small businesses and all the different services that make a small town tick.\nTown officials, under pressure from citizens, said no to this opportunity. Rather than work with the company to better understand the project and address concerns, the town leaders said no and now another community will benefit from these jobs and the economic development that comes with it.\nAccording to state data, Caroline County is among the most economically depressed counties in Maryland. We can't lay all the blame at the feet of elected leaders for that. I know many of them, and each one cares deeply for the communities they serve; otherwise, they wouldn't do it. The blame, however, should be shared with the voters that elected them and the voters who pushed the elected leaders to say no to investments in the towns that would spur economic growth over fears of the unknown and fears of something different, a break from the past.\nBecause the citizens share the blame, they are responsible for turning their communities around.\nOur rural communities are blessed with resources that other towns and cities envy. We have kind, friendly people who care for each other. We have the greatest renewable resource of all — an unending stream of smart and talented young men and women graduating from our high schools and colleges, prepared to make the world a better place. Let's do everything we can to keep them here.\nLet our legacy be that we found that balance that everyone strives for and leave the next generation and the generations that follow a community poised for growth, good jobs and continued access to outstanding education. Let's be sure we live up to the motto, \"Pride in the Past, Faith in the Future.\"\nBrandon Wright grew up in Federalsburg and graduated from Colonel Richardson High School in 1997 and Salisbury University in 2001. He was the chief of staff at the Maryland Department of Planning from 2015 to 2017. He now lives in Annapolis, but his family still resides just outside of Federalsburg. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planners not sold on 365-unit development near new Easton hospital\n\n June 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An application for a 365-unit residential development near the in-construction regional medical center in Easton has been submitted to the town's Planning Commission for review, though it's drawing criticism from some town and county officials.The project, Fox Chase Estates, is proposed on 112 acres of land off of Airport Road nestled within the Easton Technology Center. Developers are seeking town approval through Easton's planned unit development process, which would allow the homes to be built on the commercial-zoned land.\nThe developers are Easton Sunrise Partners LLC and Scott Wagner, a Talbot County businessman and a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. They previously aimed to build warehouses on the site, but in recent years plans shifted to residential — an effort that Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel supports, according to Wagner's attorney, Lawrence Scott.\n\"We are trying to build a residential community that meets the need of the hospital,\" Scott said Tuesday, noting that Wagner and Kozel have met to discuss the project.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Kozel said affordable housing availability is \"essential\" to recruit and retain health care workers in a rural community like Easton. The hospital is not legally or financially involved with the proposed development, Scott said.\nAt an hours long meeting Tuesday, Planning Commission members were nowhere near ready to provide a positive recommendation on the proposal.\n\"It feels like we're being the Planning Commission for the hospital and not for the town,\" said member William Ryall. \"And that gives me a lot of concern.\"\nVictoria McAndrews said the plans are \"overwhelmingly suburban.\" Michael Ports, the commission's vice chair, said a lack of connectivity from the proposed development — which sits at the northernmost part of town limits — to Easton's core is a \"non-starter.\"\nPhilip Toussaint, commission chair, said parts of the plan significantly fall short of meeting Easton's comprehensive plan, which sets the framework for how the town facilitates growth. That comprehensive plan is undergoing an update currently, and McAndrews said such a large project should wait for that update.\nScott said Tuesday that developers have met individually with Town Council members and Mayor Megan Cook multiple times and that the 365-unit project meets affordable housing needs that the town and its residents are asking for.\nTHE UNITS\nApplication documents show that developers are planning for a variety of units, including single-family homes, three-story townhomes and multifamily buildings, along with two commercial buildings.\nThe 365 units are broken down as follows: 108 single-family detached homes, 137 three-story townhomes and 120 multifamily units, the latter of which are contained in four four-story buildings.\nThe density is well below the maximum permitted by the town's planned unit development standards. According to developers, 185 of the 365 units would be affordably priced.\n\"We're doing that without even the statutory forcing of us to do it,\" Scott said, adding that developers have a \"bidding war\" from home building companies to take on the project. \"The market is working on its own.\"\nAPPROVAL PROCESS\nFox Chase Estates still has a handful of steps before it is approved by Easton officials. With significant pushback already, it's likely to be a lengthy process.\nIn staff analysis of the application, concerns were raised about the site plan, which only includes one main vehicle access point to the 365-unit development. An emergency exit stretching west to Goldsborough Neck Road did not satisfy town staff. Scott said developers would prefer not to add that as a main access point but will consider it.\n\"We really want two access points to any project like this,\" said Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh.\nTalbot County Engineer Ray Clarke criticized the project and the lack of communication between developers and the county. Clarke said it'll put an undue stress on Airport and Goldsborough Neck Roads and added concerns that the homes will be in the runway protection zone for Easton Airport.\n\"We need to be very, very careful when we're looking at these types of development,\" Clarke said. \"This was general commercial as originally planned. We were told three or four years ago it was going to be warehouses.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Planning Commission opted to place a pin in the matter and revisit it on July 17. Commission members may then provide a recommendation.\nOnce the commission makes its recommendation, council members will consider the application and hold a public hearing before any decision. While the council may take the commission's decision into account, the five council members have the final say, with a majority required for approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

(Hauptmann was later executed.)On this date:\nIn 1633, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei arrived in Rome for trial before the Inquisition, accused of defending Copernican theory that the Earth revolved around the sun instead of the other way around.

The email stated that the new restaurant will replace the establishment's current Easton location on 8192 Ocean Gateway, which is between Jiffy Lube and Walgreens.\nThe new restaurant is currently under construction. It will be located at 8518 Ocean Gateway, which is just north of Royal Farms.\nEaston Town Planner Lynn Thomas said the new Burger King received site plan approval from the Easton Planning Commission and should offer an improved design.\nIn August 2021, the project received subdivision approval from the Planning Commission. The Commission voted to approve the restaurant's site plan, architecture and parking waiver request during a meeting the following month. According to meeting minutes from the September 2021 meeting, architect Robert Zappulla said plans for the new restaurant's look took inspiration from Easton's downtown. He said they wanted to make it look like a Burger King was placed in an existing building in Easton.\nThomas said he does not know what Burger King's plans for the location on 8192 Ocean Gateway are. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "CCTC AMP students present designs - Rashad Wilson's winning design adorns dartboard cabinet project\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1A | Section: News \n \n 458\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY - The seventh cohort of Advanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center recently presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet.The winning design was created by Rashad Wilson, and was inspired by the doors one might find hanging in a saloon in the Old West.\"Rashad's dartboard design offers a new challenge for the class and me,\" teacher Keith Hale said.Although the students possessed the software and the capability to machine a three-dimensional object like the steer skull and horns, they had never attempted it before. \"This design is more challenging than designs created by previous classes,\" he said.This particular project was generated three years ago when an AMP student approached Hale with the idea of manufacturing dartboard cabinets. Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

    "content": "Letter had no good reasoning\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 397\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sometimes you publish letters to the editor that contain strong political views that are based on false information or bad logic or both.When a political view is based on good reasoning, I don't feel the need to respond. But I do feel the need to respond when a writer gets published with no good reasoning. Such is the case with Mr. Adrian's letter \"Gone down a dark road,\" in Sunday's 14 January edition.\nHis letter is filled with false statements. For example, he claims that Democrats control elections to push some kind of agenda. There is no evidence for that. Quite the contrary. Mr. Adrian somehow completely missed the well-known information that Republicans are involved in managing elections. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of examples.\nEven the head Republican, Donald Trump, knew that when he called the Republicans who control elections asking them to alter votes in 2020. As another example, Mr. Adrian seems to claim that harvesting crops in the fall leads to harvesting ballots. I don't think there is any evidence for that.\nBut what really gets me is the use of questions for arguments. This illogical method of argument is a tool of conspiracy theorists and despots for thousands of years. \"When did you stop beating your spouse?\" is the classic retort to that entire form of reasoning.\nMr. Adrian received a document about mail-in ballots and points out he could print it. \"What could possibly go wrong?\" he writes as if that question is a legitimate argument against the entire process. Without evidence, the question makes no sense, any more than me asking Mr. Adrian when he stopped beating people. Mr. Adrian should read about how the Arizona Republican Party spent millions of tax dollars on a month's-long audit of ballots that only showed Mr. Biden's votes were undercounted. Georgia audited their elections three times by hand counting ballots and found no fraud. These are just two facts out of hundreds of examples that belie the assumption underlying Mr. Adrian's question.\nMr. Adrian poses many other questions that assume evidence where none exists. And he ends his letter with the question, \"Which political party controls the Board of Elections anyway?\" as if that is a reason for everyone to doubt elections. It is not.\nAll available evidence is that elections in Maryland are fair and honest. People should appreciate that and take the time to vote.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They voluntarily manned a life support unit 24/7, 365 days a year.\nIt slowly grew into a larger effort, a countywide paramedic system and, eventually, today's Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, which includes six full-fledged life support units.\nAt the end of our conversation, I asked them if four decades later, their aspiration was met. \"Goal was reached,\" they told me without hesitation.\nTo learn more about Talbot County's \"first five\" advanced life support visionaries, read my story below. Also in today's newsletter: Easton debates food trucks, local artists design banners for downtown Denton, Chris Van Hollen holds a town hall and more.\nThanks for reading.\n— Konner Metz \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chad Hill, the company's vice president, said the 82-room hotel stands out in more ways than one.\n\"This is not a prototypical Fairfield hotel,\" Hill said. He emphasized its cleanliness, customer service and customized designs that give the hotel a small-town, Eastern Shore feel.\nEvery year, Hill said Marriott checks into each hotel for a random inspection. Marriott assesses each hotel based on a set of standards, while separately soliciting feedback from recent guests. Based on these evaluations and guest review scores, a small percentage of hotels receive the Diamond Award, a recognition from Marriott of the highest performing tier of Fairfield hotels.\nOf the 1,118 hotels evaluated, the Easton Fairfield Inn & Suites was rated fourth in intent to recommend, fifth in staff service and seventh in cleanliness.\nThe Easton Fairfield was recognized with the 2023 Diamond Award, marking its second consecutive year and third since opening in 2015. However, this year, the hotel went a step further when Marriott recognized it as Hotel of the Year within the Fairfield brand.\nAccording to Cristina Shockley, Hill Hospitality's director of operations, the Easton hotel is a popular destination for corporate stays and those in town for weddings.\nShockley added that many of the employees are familiar with the Eastern Shore and its history and charm, a benefit for guests that are visiting for the first time. Some team members have been at the hotel since it opened, she said.\n\"We're so fortunate to have an incredible team,\" Hill said of the team that hovers around 23 employees.\nSince the hospitality group is based in Easton, Hill said it's special to have the hometown property recognized at such a high level. Hill Hospitality manages six hotels, two each in Maryland and South Carolina, and one each in Maine and New York. Two additional hotels are in the works, including one in Fruitland that will open in June 2025.\n\"Every guest is given the opportunity to enjoy the charming small-town atmosphere that the Easton team provides when staying at our hotel,\" Shockley said in a written statement. \"The Hotel of the Year award is a testament to the team's unwavering commitment to give the ultimate in guest service. When walking through the front door, the hotel has a feeling of timelessness and added pride that distinguishes it from other Fairfields in the brand.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Herzog Foundation.The Herzog Foundation is a national organization dedicated to \"advancing Christian education.\" The foundation enriches Christian (K-12) education by creating and leading various programs.\nOne of these programs was the 2023 Bill of Rights Essay Contest. All middle and high school students enrolled in a Christian school or those homeschooled in the U.S. were eligible to participate. Winners were selected from one middle school and one high school. Each winner would go on to receive $250 from the Herzog Foundation. The winners' schools also received an additional $250.\nParticipants were asked to answer these questions in three pages or less, \"What made the Bill of Rights so revolutionary and unique when it was ratified? How has the Bill of Rights shaped our country?\"\nIn an excerpt from Viana's eloquently crafted three-page essay, the middle school winner wrote, \"The Bill of Rights is famous for that little, life-changing word: freedom, but what most people don't realize is that these documents weren't written overnight. Real people struggled, wrestled, and mulled over each word and phrase that went into the Bill of Rights, until it was finally ratified on December 15, 1791. Not only was it composed through much time and consideration but it secured the rights of people today granting our blessed country to grow, expand, and enter new times of innovation. It summarized what we stood for then and stand for now. It lets a person breathe, work, and earn their way to success.\"\nThe Herzog Foundation announced Viana, daughter of George and Cathy Johnston, as the middle school winner of the contest in December. Johnston received the prize money and a trophy for her achievement.\nIn a release announcing the winners, Herzog Foundation Chairman Todd Graves said, \"The Bill of Rights was ratified over 230 years ago and still stands as a beacon for our most fundamental rights as Americans. It's crucial that all young students understand the significance of this founding document.\"\nKathy Guerra, head of Lighthouse Christian Academy, stated the school was initially in disbelief, as this was the first time their school had made an entry to a contest of this magnitude. However, they were not surprised that Viana had won, as she is a gifted writer who creates masterworks of art with her words. \"Viana is an inquisitive, energetic, and ambitious student,\" says Guerra, who \"seeks to excel in all of her subjects.\"\nTo learn more about the Herzog Foundation and the programs it has to offer, visit www.herzog foundation.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Typically, you are looking at people who have previously voted, who are kind in that soft middle,\" said Waite, who has mostly worked on Republican campaigns.\nWaite said while social media can help engage more voters and could help engage nonvoters, especially young ones, the medium presents challenges.\n\"You are competing with everything else. The slice of time you get in front of them is very very small,\" he said of the social media content streams.\nNegative campaigning, coarse social discourse and misinformation on key issues have also magnified on social media leaving voters and nonvoters distrustful of content and disparate and sometimes ideological information sources.\n\"It's hard for average voters to figure out what's going on,\" said Waite.\nIn an Aug. 26 letter to the House Judiciary Committee, META Platforms chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the Biden-Harris administration \"repeatedly pressured\" Facebook and Instagram to censor dissenting content (including humor and satire) related to COVID-19.\nThe White House defended those actions as helping protect public health from misinformation.\nRecent surveys show low levels of trust in politics, the media and government, as well as plenty of economic stress stemming from the post-pandemic inflation wave.\nA June survey by financial firm Credit Karma and research firm Qualtrics found 68% of Americans don't believe official economic data touting job gains and easing inflation after post-pandemic spikes in prices.\nAnother recent poll by Gallup and the Walton Foundation shows Gen Zers (ages 12 to 27) have little trust in the media, government and politics. But they showed strong turnout in 2020 and are expected to also show up in November, said Craig Snyder, campaign director for Haley Voters for Harris (a group that hopes to get GOP supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to eschew Trump).\nNEW ENERGY?Snyder said Harris' campaign should energize younger voters more than the matchup between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\"They weren't excited about a race between two 80-year-old men,\" said Snyder, noting that Democratic enthusiasm for Harris will also generate GOP energy for Trump.\nHarris was installed at the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden, 81, was pressured to quit the race by donors and party power players over concerns about his age.\nSnyder said voting groups such as suburban women, Black and Hispanic men, along with voters on both sides of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas could tip the race in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump could also shift his voters, many of whom are disaffected by COVID policies (including vaccines), in key states.\nSnyder also sees another contingent of nonvoters beyond the disaffected and those with logistical barriers.\n\"There's a third group,\" he said. \"They just don't connect politics to their lives.\"\nGOTV EFFORTSPolitical organizations on both sides do have get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts across the country, including some aimed at first-time and nonvoters.\nConservative groups — such as Christians United for Israel — hope to turn out evangelicals for Trump and Republicans. That includes working with churches across the country on support for Israel and voter mobilization.\nDemocrats look to college campuses, as well as Native Americans, Blacks and Hispanics in key races.\nIn Montana, Nick Marroletti, coordinated campaign director for the state Democratic Party, said grassroots turn-out efforts have included knocking on 100,000 doors and making 97,000 phone calls supporting U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, who faces a tough challenge from Republican Tim Sheehy.\n'LACK OF FAITH'Mara Ostfeld, a research scientist at the University of Michigan, analyzed voting sentiments in Detroit and found Latino voters, in particular, have lower turnout propensities.\nOstfeld agrees that nonvoters, especially lower-income ones, don't see the outcome of elections impacting their daily lives.\n\"There is a disconnect,\" Ostfeld said. But she also said that doesn't mean nonvoters are not engaged or connected to their communities in other ways and don't follow politics.\n\"It's not like they are disinterested or disengaged,\" Ostfeld said. \"There is just a lack of faith in the political system in particular.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials said he was on the water for \"several hours\" and around three miles from home.\nUsing thermal imaging cameras, a Natural Resource Police aviation unit quickly found the lost person — in around five minutes, according to Sgt. John Buchanan, chief pilot for NRP. Buchanan was in the aircraft with tactical flight officer Christian Helwig.\nBuchanan said the kayaker left out of Grace Creek.\n\"I think it got dark on him, and he didn't know where he was,\" Buchanan said.\nOnce located, police used a spotlight to direct a rescue boat from the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Company toward the juvenile.\nA video posted to Facebook by Natural Resource Police shows the aircraft hone in on the kayaker and direct the fire boat to retrieve the juvenile.\nBuchanan said such a rescue isn't too common, but it become somewhat prominent during boating season.\n\"(The) Chesapeake Bay and the tributaries are very large,\" Buchanan said. \"When you start thinking about the different rivers and creeks and stuff off the Chesapeake Bay, we go out on different search missions like that probably a few times a month.\"\nThe pilot emphasized Helwig's expertise is crucial to such rescues. Helwig handles the thermal imaging camera, which can expose subjects in dark conditions, as well as a mapping system to pull up addresses and latitudes and longitudes.\n\"He's gotten really good with it, he's worked really hard at it,\" Buchanan said. \"He's made us as a team very successful going out and doing these search missions.\"\nBuchanan advises those going out on the water, especially alone, to be prepared with a charged cell phone and other equipment in case of emergency.\n\"Have a life jacket if you're out at night,\" he said. \"Obviously have some kind of flashlight. And know the area, that's probably the biggest thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We read in Chapter 3, verse 21-23, \"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end.They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!\" We often find ourselves lamenting the state of the world today.Injustices against minorities, human trafficking, mass shootings and other heartbreaking occurrences seem to dominate the headlines of the news. Even so, amid all our trials, troubles and tribulations, we are reminded that the sun peeks out from the clouds, and a single candlelight can chase the night away.In John 8:12, Jesus tells us that He is \"the light of the world\", and those who follow Him \"will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.\" With God's word, and with Jesus as the light of the world that we follow, we have the hope that the \"steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end.\" In the end, it will be all right. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is complete\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 1257\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — The Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is built, running and ready for the next step in the Lakeside development plan, which is transferring ownership to the town of Trappe.Two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented during a recent Trappe Council meeting. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nThis controversial project has faced lawsuits, petitions and an array of public outcry over environmental concerns, but it is an essential step in moving forward with the Lakeside development.\nFirst proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside at Trappe development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50. The development is slated to include a mix of single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and commercial and retail spaces.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes. That flow will eventually be diverted to the new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved by county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nSpray irrigation systemThe new plant, set with enriched nutrient removal technology, uses a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Water Science Center, the sprayed wastewater either evaporates into the air, soaks into the soil or percolates through the soil and recharges the groundwater.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., a project management and civil engineering firm for Lakeside, said spray irrigation has been recognized for years by states and the federal government as a preferred method of treated wastewater disposal.\n\"It is an exceptional re-use method of disposal that recharges groundwater and can provide needed nutrients to agricultural ground covers,\" he said. \"Generally, spray irrigation does not require the highest levels of treatment, so valuable nutrients are available for plants to reduce farmers' costs for additional commercial fertilizer.\"\nRaunch said this is based on Lakeside's developer's voluntary election to provide enhanced nutrient removal level treatment to avoid groundwater nutrient increases. The MDE discharge permit establishes strict limitations on the discharge of treated wastewater, which results in the application of a fraction of the nutrient uptake requirements of the grass planted in the irrigation field.\nRaunch said that due to the high quality of the Lakeside wastewater effluent and the nutrient needs of the ground cover, there is no practical scenario in which the spray irrigation of treated effluent will negatively impact surface or groundwater.\n\"Ironically, the nutrient levels of the treated effluent will be so low that the farmer will have to apply fertilizer to the spray irrigation field to maintain a vigorous and healthy crop cover,\" he said.\nAlan Girard, advocacy director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, argued that nutrients absorbed into groundwater could eventually discharge into nearby impaired rivers and streams like the Choptank River.\n\"I don't think people understand that the state is claiming that there will be zero discharge of nutrients to groundwater,\" Girard said. \"The state has already demonstrated that there's a link between groundwater and surface water and surface letters that are tarred right near the discharge. So the state needs to be accountable for that issue.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit in, citing concerns about the spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs for ShoreRivers, said that the wastewater issue has been a concern for ShoreRivers due to the existing Trappe plant and how poorly it has been functioning and treating the wastewater before discharging it into Trappe Creek.\nAccording to Pluta, the Lakeside Plant is making noticeable improvements that were not seen in the old Trappe Wastewater Plant.\n\"I'll go on and say that one thing that's very clear and obvious is that there will be more treatment from this new plant,\" Pluta said. \"The wastewater will be treated to a cleaner standard. That's what we want to see. We support that. The thing that concerns us with the new plan is just the method of discharge. That's where they'll be spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields.\"\nPluta said the way the state permits spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields is under what he calls \"legal fiction or false assumptions.\" When someone is spraying wastewater on a farm field, that wastewater gets taken up by the plants.\nThrough studying agricultural practices, Pluta has learned of the impacts of runoff and pollution on groundwater. He said there are different incentives for someone operating a wastewater treatment plant compared to farmers caring for local crops.\nPluta stated that no farmer is applying nutrients to their crops every day throughout the whole growing season. There is an incentive for wastewater treatment operators to focus on controlling their volume and not so much on a healthy crop, which Pluta said is concerning for the sake of adding too much pollution to these fields.\nEach farm that receives spraying from the plant needs a nutrient management plan on how many nutrients can be put on the fields. Those plans were not public information, but because it was part of the treatment process, ShoreRiver argued to make that information public.\nIt was through the 2020 filed lawsuit that the permit was remanded to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which issued a new permit with fewer homes and less wastewater.\nA separate lawsuit was filed against MDE by concerned residents in May 2022 asking to revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewage system as inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan. Though the suits was ultimately dismissed last June, MDE issued a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day. A vast decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nOversightIn part due to the outcry and lawsuits made by residents and environmental organizations, a wave of resolutions were brought forward to better address concerns involving the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nOne that stood out to many was Resolution 338, which amended Talbot County's Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan. It requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan for any future expansion of the new Lakeside wastewater treatment plant.\nThough this was deemed favorable to the environmental organizations, there were many, including members of Trappe's council, that opposed the Lakeside resolutions.\nDuring a public hearing before the vote of Resolution 338, Brian Schmidt, Trappe Town Council president, commented opposing the resolution and stated that the county was treating Trappe differently than other towns, hurting the municipality's growth.\n\"We did not ask this council to intervene,\" Schmidt said. \"MDE is the controlling authority in matters of wastewater discharge, not the county. Disguising growth legislation as wastewater discharge is not proper procedure is only impeding the town's authority to control its own growth.\"\nNext stepsDuring the June 5 Trappe Town Council meeting, two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nAccording to Showalter, Once the initial phase of the wastewater treatment plant is complete and turned over to the town, the developer remains responsible for any deficiencies between the costs of operation and maintenance and the sewer revenues collected by the Town from Lakeside residents. Additionally, the developer remains responsible for the incremental expansion of the wastewater treatment plant as the capacity is utilized.\nFurther discussion on the transfer agreements will be discussed and reviewed during the Town Council's next executive session. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As avian flu spreads, local businesses grapple with increased egg costs\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 460\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Steve Mangasarian's is paying double what he used to for wholesale eggs.He says the price has been rising steadily since the pandemic. The recent spread of avian influenza virus, or avian flu, is accelerating that trend.\nMangasarian, the owner and chef of Breakfast in Easton, buys eggs from a vendor that sources locally. Due to the avian flu threatening poultry flocks nationwide, egg shortages are impacting businesses.\n\"The entire supply, nationwide supply, has been curtailed because of this. There's a shortage, even though I'm using local, fresh eggs,\" Mangasarian said. \"Everybody's getting squeezed.\"\nMangasarian, like some other business owners, has been forced to raise prices. At Breakfast in Easton, he's added a 50-cent surcharge to an order of eggs and a 75-cent surcharge to an order of pancakes.\n\"It is my intention to make this temporary,\" signs in the restaurant read.\nAvian flu outbreaks across the nation have afflicted egg supply, with the worst impacts felt in western and midwestern states. But local flocks have been affected as well.\nPer the Maryland Department of Agriculture, five commercial poultry farms on the Eastern Shore have experienced outbreaks, including three just last month. Several other cases were reported in Delaware.\nThe virus can spread easily between flocks, though the risk for bird-to-human transmission is low at present.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost for a dozen eggs was $4.15 at the end of 2024. One year earlier, the average cost was $2.51.\nThe current mark is nearing record costs seen during the avian flu outbreak in 2022. And U.S. Department of Agriculture projections predict a 20% increase in egg prices for 2025.\nFor Mangasarian, the sharp rise in egg prices has been a significant challenge. In past years, lower egg wholesale prices helped him \"subsidize\" a low return on bacon. That's flipped, however, as his returns on bacon now make up for tight egg returns.\nAt the Easton Diner on U.S. Route 50, manager Tiff Haddaway says it costs around $1,000 more per week to purchase eggs due to the recent shortage and wholesale prices. As of now, customers aren't seeing an upcharge.\n\"The owner is trying to not pass it onto the customer,\" Haddaway said.\nSteve Andrews, owner of the Bagery, says customers aren't experiencing any increases since the business' local, free-range producer hasn't been hit by the avian flu.\nAndrews, a backyard chicken flock owner for more than 15 years, did note that egg production costs have risen in past years due to increasing feed prices.\n\"We foresee that all producers, which get their day-old chicks from just a handful of operations, will all be increasing their demand to replace the culled flocks,\" Andrews wrote. \"If any of the hatcheries themselves have an outbreak, this could indicate that egg prices have not peaked and could rise even further.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "One proves enough for Easton\n\n October 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Both coaches obviously wanted victory, and after 80 minutes of heated, physical play in the latest installment of the Easton-St. Michaels High soccer rivalry, Warrior head coach Avery Brice breathed a sigh of relief as his team continued its late-season surge.\"Good game. One-oh. Got the result,\" Brice said after Rodrigo Fresco's goal in the fifth minute Wednesday night proved enough for a 1-0 Easton victory over the Saints.\nAnd though St. Michaels suffered its fourth loss in five games, Saints head coach Pat Hambleton may have gotten something he was looking for as well — momentum.\n\"We've had a hard stretch,\" Hambleton said after his team's third one-goal loss in 10 days, which included a 3-2 double-overtime defeat to two-time defending North Bayside champion Queen Anne's County. \"I asked them, 'Just give us momentum. Create momentum so we can move forward. Win, lose, draw, figure out a way to play well. Work hard. Find something to carry on for tomorrow (a 9-0 victory Thursday over Cambridge-South Dorchester) and then carry on into the playoffs.'\"\nThe Saints (6-4-1 overall, 2-4-1 North Bayside) may have found that momentum, playing the game's last 35 minutes, 54 seconds a man down after one of its players received a red card while an Easton player was given a yellow.\n\"I thought down (to) 10 men, I felt like we had the upper hand, and I felt like we were the man up,\" said Hambleton, who argued Easton should have also received a red.\n\"Couldn't be more proud,\" Hambleton added of his team. \"We took them out of their game. They were sitting six guys in the back for the last 20 minutes terrified of our attack and our pressure. And I thought the second half was a completely different game than the first half.\"\nWith 4:28 elapsed in the first half, Fresco got a ball on the right side and parked it past Saints keeper Lucas Greenwood for the game's lone goal and a 1-0 Warrior lead.\nThe remainder of the game featured a string of highlight-reel saves by Greenwood (10 saves) and Easton goalie Sam Hutchison (eight saves).\nGreenwood leaped to punch a ball away with 26:10 remaining in the first half. Hutchison stopped St. Michaels' Abel Delgaudio just 50 seconds later. Greenwood lunged left to foil Luke Stanco a little over 5 minutes later. St. Michaels' Connor Wheeler then struck a direct kick that Hutchison reached before colliding with Delgaudio. Greenwood made another stop a moment later, and Hutchsion responded with another save before a second collision 5 minutes later, leaving Brice pleading with his team, \"You need to wake up.\"\nThe game was mostly played between the 18s in the second half, though both keepers continued to come up big. Easton had a chance to pad its lead 9 minutes into the half, but Emmet Fox drove a shot off the left post. Hutchison picked up another save, when he knocked away a ball on a Saints corner. Greenwood maintained the one-goal difference, smothering a ball off a wild scramble with an Easton player leaping over him.\n\"We just need to be consistent in the back and then take care of the ball a little bit better,\" said Brice, his team 6-5, 6-2 after its fourth win in five games.\nFor Hambleton, it was a familiar theme.\n\"The story of the second half of our season is we're winning games off the scoreboard,\" Hambleton said. \"And that doesn't count.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I haven't been throwing it all year. It's been iffy. But I came out of the gate and it came out of my hand amazingly. And I was able to throw a split-finger today amazingly, too. I just threw it and it hit spots. That's all I got to say.\"\nPalmer didn't have to say much more late Tuesday afternoon, as he yielded five hits in six-plus innings to help Queen Anne's to an 11-8 victory over Easton, drawing the Lions closer to their first North Bayside title since 1980.\nWinners of five straight, Queen Anne's (8-6 overall, 5-1 North Bayside) can clinch the North championship with victories over Cambridge-South Dorchester and Kent County.\nColonel Richardson (11-5, 5-2), which blanked St. Michaels 3-0 yesterday behind Jordan Regulski's complete-game three-hitter, still remains in contention in the North. Should the Lions lose one of their two remaining division contests and finish tied with Colonel, the Colonels would win the North via their 8-1 victory over Queen Anne's in the only head-to-head meeting between the two schools this season.\nKent Island (7-8, 5-2) also has an outside shot. Though they lost to Queen Anne's in the second meeting between the two schools — which counts toward the division standings — the Bucs defeated Colonel and hold the tiebreaker between those two schools.\nEaston (10-5, 4-3), which was in the running for its first North crown since 2007, got two first-inning runs against Palmer (5-2) but then was held scoreless by the Lions ace until the bottom of the sixth inning.\n\"Credit goes to their pitcher,\" Easton head coach Albert Pritchett said of Palmer, who struck out six and walked two before being relieved in the seventh. \"He did a great job. After the first couple of innings he really settled in, working on his pitches, threw strikes.\"\nPalmer and Easton's Kayden Webb (4-1) were locked in a pitcher's duel, tied at 2-2 heading to the top of the sixth.\nThat's when the Lions busted the game open, scoring six runs on five hits.\nWith one out, Noah Cramer walked, moved to second on a low pitch and scored the go-ahead run on Chance Hegedus' double down the left-field line. Ethan Keppler singled, sending Hegedus (3 for 4, three runs) to third. Hegedus got caught in a rundown between home and third. Warrior catcher Colin Mooney ran Hegedus back before throwing the ball to third baseman Garrett Fink. But with no one covering home, Hegedus raced across the plate for a 4-2 lead.\nWebb was relieved after Brendan Parsley singled. Dustin Blue walked the first man he faced before Travis Sutch (4 for 4, three RBIs), whose solo homer off the left-field pole tied the game at 2-2 in the third, singled through the right side, plating two runs for a 6-2 lead. Two batters later, Dulin Clark belted a two-run double for an 8-2 lead.\n\"I think we're hitting pretty good right now,\" Travis Sutch said. \"Definitely a big improvement over the last couple games. Everybody's starting to get going now, especially the bottom of our lineup.\"\nEaston ended its scoring drought in the bottom of the sixth. Dylan Cassell doubled and scored when Blue sent a shot over Parsley's head in center field. Chase Raab's sacrifice fly made it 8-4. But Palmer got a strikeout and groundout to end the inning.\n\"He did a great job today,\" Queen Anne's head coach Rick Sutch said of Palmer. \"He knew this was a big game. We went into it knowing that we were in the driver's seat as far as the Bayside North. He knew how big this was and he had at least five days off, so he was fresh.\n\"Usually Noah doesn't let anything bother him so once he got the lead I wasn't really too concerned,\" Coach Sutch added. \"Webb's a good pitcher on the other side, so we knew we had to get to him early to get to the bullpen. But Noah did a great job. He controlled the game.\"\nQueen Anne's tacked on three runs on five hits in the seventh, stretching their lead to 11-4.\nThe Warriors pieced together their biggest inning in the seventh, with Mikey O'Connor hitting a two-run single and Carter Mooney sending a sacrifice fly to center to make it 11-8 before Clough induced a game-ending groundout.\nNotes: Webb tripled in the first and Colin Mooney doubled in the seventh for Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Commissioners unanimously voted in favor of the ordinance to remove the cap.\nThe plan for community solar was first introduced to commissioners in December, 2024, when Pivot Energy's lawyer Anthony Kupersmith said getting rid of the cap would be critical to the project's success.\nCambridge City Planner Brian Hermann presented Pivot Energy's community solar proposal to commissioners again last week. \"The community solar projects are designed to provide opportunities for residents of the community who don't own their house, or are living in the woods and have shade, or don't want to look at solar panels,\" Hermann said.\nCommunity solar is a way for multiple individuals to share in the benefits of a single solar installation, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. \"The term refers to the pooling of resources to develop a community-scale solar energy project that provides the benefits of solar energy to a group or neighborhood,\" the USDE website states.\nAfter around an hour of questions from commissioners, Mayor Lajan Cephas thanked the gentlemen from Pivot Energy and attempted to move on to the next agenda item, but Commissioner Roche had one more question he 'demanded' be answered before voting on the ordinance.\n\"So at the end of the day, how do we know, and how does the state know that this power is actually for its intended purpose, which is to lower the utility rates of, in many cases, income constrained individuals, or the community, where it's located?\" Roche asked.\nKupersmith told Roche this word isn't neutral and lends authority to regulatory oversight from the Public Service Commission through an application, bonding, subscriber certification and annual reporting to ensure benefits, especially for low- and moderate-income customers.\nHermann and Pivot Energy representatives were uncertain of how many acres they will need for the new community solar project, but it will exceed the current cap. Kupersmith and Pivot Energy Development Project Manager John Shields made it clear that if the city does not remove the cap, Pivot Energy is willing to go to the state, which can supersede the city's code.\nCommissioners asked if there were decommissioning protocols for the end of the project's life or in case of damage. The decommissioning plan and bond would follow the city's existing zoning rules and Public Service Commission standards.\nWhen it comes to what exactly the community solar project will look like, Pivot Energy is keeping its options open.\nShields said at the current moment, there is not a drawn-up project plan. \"We'd rather kind of look at it more holistically if we can,\" Shields said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I trust your recess was restful. Unfortunately, it was also silent. You chose not to hold a town hall meeting during your time in the district. That absence did not go unnoticed. It deprived your constituents of the chance to hear you explain why you reversed yourself on the spending bill you had so fiercely opposed — until you suddenly didn't. You claimed \"assurances\" persuaded you. Assurances of what, exactly? Your vote helped push through the single largest increase in the federal deficit in history. If you stand by that decision, you should have had the courage to face us and defend it.But my main concern today is not the budget, it is the Jeffrey Epstein files. You are a Catholic. You are a father of daughters. Given both, it should not require any moral calculus to condemn not only Epstein, but also anyone who willingly associated with him while he and his circle exploited, abused, and demeaned young women. The conduct in question — sexual assault, abuse of minors, harassment in dressing rooms, grotesque violations of trust — is abhorrent. And participation in, or willful blindness to, these acts is unforgivable.\nYour colleagues in Congress are circulating a bipartisan discharge petition demanding the release of all Epstein files. This is a defining moment for you. Will you align yourself with justice and transparency, or will you shield predators and the powerful? As a father, you owe this to every parent whose child was harmed. As a man of faith, you owe it to your conscience. As my representative, you owe it to me.\nSo let me be clear: I expect you to sign this petition. I demand that you sign it. Your record of retreat and equivocation has already earned you the nickname \"nowhere man.\" If you fail to step up here, it will confirm that title — and worse, it will mark you as someone who turned away from the helpless in their moment of need.\nThe victims deserve closure. The public deserves the truth. The perpetrators deserve justice. Representative Harris, history will remember whether you stood tall or disappeared. Choose wisely.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Instead, they focus instead on fund raising, collecting dues, marketing services, lobbying and sending periodic news updates to their members.\nPutnam also drew a distinction between two different but equally important types of social capital.\nOne type is \"bonding\" which occurs within a homogenous demographic group.\nThe other type is \"bridging\" which unites people from different groups.\nPutnam concluded a lack of social capital undermines the active civic engagement that a strong democracy requires from its citizens.\nI now know my friend's visit was more than a get-together to talk over old times, catch up on current times and ponder on the future.\nIn all our discussions, including those with civil discourse on politics, we built social capital.\nIt was unexpected opportunity to think about and evaluate what I can be and should be doing to help address the lack of civil discourse and to help increase social capital in our society.\nThe answer is clear.\nGoing forward, I must consistently strive to:\nRespectively consider all points of view.Listen with more than waiting for my turn to talk.Say regularly \"you may be right.\"Limit discussions as debates.Disagree without being disagreeable.Always look for opportunities to build social capital. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A record 63 veterans participated.The event, sponsored by Project Healing Waters Fly-Fishing, Inc.(PHWFF), headquartered in La Plata, had not been held since 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Concerns for the health of everyone, especially veterans still recovering for wounds, was the main reason for delaying the resumption of the event.A record number of privately owned boats, 36, were provided by qualified boat captain \"guides\" to take the veterans out fly-fishing at different locations around the Chesapeake Bay. The boats, veterans and guides departed early Saturday, Aug. 19, all going out by 7 a.m., fishing until 11 a.m.Founded in 2005 by Navy veteran Ed Nicholson of southern Maryland, PHWFF was founded especially for wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. PHWFF hosts over 200 such events nationally, from coast to coast; 85% of all donations to the foundation go directly to support these events.The first Stars & Stripers began as part of PHWFF in 2009, led by veteran Roger Carlson, of Edgewater, with only five veterans and five fishing guides. Carlson eventually turned over leadership of this local event to the late Vietnam veteran, U.S. Army Major (retired) Dr. Ed Fulton, who became a successful orthopedic surgeon in civilian life. Fulton hosted the event at Dominion Marina for seven years, until his unexpected death in May 2017. With his marina sold, the event was relocated to the Kent Island Yacht Club.Fly-fishing enthusiast Mark Eustis, of Davidsonville, has managed the event since 2017. Pulling together the support of local businesses and the immediate fraternal community to continue a first-class fishing experience for these veterans, Eustis recognized the aid received from the Kent Island American Legion, Centreville Post 18, Queenstown Post 296, Grasonville VFW Post 2576 and the Kent Island Elks, Lodge 2576, in Stevensville.Under the leadership of Elks member Lorraine Sincavage, the organization provided 11 volunteers to serve a wonderful luncheon for the veterans, their families and boat guides following the morning of fishing.Local businesses, Fisherman's Crab Deck and Harris Seafood, Inc., provided steamed crabs, and the Yacht Club provided pulled pork with all the side dishes.For the third time, Hardee's, under the Cato family's franchise ownership, using its \"Stars for Heroes\" program, collected donations for this event from their 23 locations around on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Delaware. Hardee's presented a check toward next year's Stars & Stripers event for $9,375. The restaurant also provided breakfast sandwiches to the attendees.Eustis had high praise for the continued support from the community. He had hoped back in 2019 to \"continue to grow the event\", having more veterans participate, pushing that number to 60-65. That was achieved this year.If interested in more information about Project Healing Waters Fly-Fishing, either as a participant or volunteer, visit their site projecthealingwaters.org. \n \n Caption: Hardee's Eastern Shore District Managers presents a check to the \"Stars & Stripers\" Healing Waters Fly Fishing Tournament Aug. 19, helping fund next year's tournament.

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Arts \n \n 438\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — The \"Science of Photography\" as captured by the artist's eye will be on full display for those who appreciate what is revealed through the camera and life's lens when a new exhibit opens in Chestertown on Wednesday, July 3.The exhibition, which runs through Aug. 28 in the interior public areas of the Heron Point Retirement Community, will display the works of seven talented photographers who have a knack for chronicling the exquisite beauty and inherent charm associated with living in and among the environs and the inhabitants of what is known as the Delmarva.\nBarbara Finneson, a representative of Heron Point's Art Interest Group, said she is personally very excited to view the work of this particular collective of artists. \"This is a special group,\" she said, noting that it is based in Salisbury, and includes the works of Mike Morris, Libby Morris, Kenneth Jones, Tony Burton, Latoya Drummond, Samuel Everett and Seldon Dix.\nThis group of photographic professionals and friends has been known to do whatever it takes, whether that means chasing 3 a.m. sunrises, enduring bitter cold, or patiently waiting for just the right light and conditions to evolve, to get the perfect shot.\n\"These Delmarva artists,\" according to the statement provided by the Art Interest Group, \"…are dedicated to capturing the unique beauty and essence of Delmarva through their lens. Their collection of work showcases the diverse landscapes, vibrant communities, and rich cultural heritage of the region, applying their individual perspectives and artistic styles. They create a fresh and innovative approach to documenting the natural wonders and human stories of Maryland's Eastern Shore.\"\nFinneson, who is a 20-year resident of Heron Point, said her community always has the good fortune to have artistic works on display in its common areas by talented resident artists and others from the community at-large. Heron Point residents, she said, are oftentimes so inspired by what they see in these exhibitions, they have been known to start painting for the first time at the age of 80, and they particularly look forward to these special collections.\nWhile the opening will take place on July 3 at 10 a.m., the artists themselves will be on-hand for a special gathering on the afternoon on Sunday, July 14 from 2 to 4 p.m. to speak to visitors about their creative process. The community is encouraged to come and participate in the discussion.\nThis exhibition will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. from June 3 through Aug. 28, with many works available for purchase. Heron Point of Chestertown is located at 501 East Campus Avenue, Chestertown. Call 410-778-7300 for more information. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Steve Mangasarian was quoted as saying trash was a problem. Is he saying it is the vendors or the patrons?\nHe also states the impact on merchants, but most stores are not open when the market opens at 8, and downtown Easton is not hopping in those early morning hours.\nWe, my spouse and I, are farmers market aficionados. When we go on extended vacations our first stop is a farmers market. It's where we learn about local specialties and food customs.\nOver the years we have developed relationships with vendors at the Easton market, and I am grateful to have a vegetable on my plate that has not traveled 1,200 miles to grace my table.\nSHARON HARRINGTON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kerns, Queen Anne's thinking they have the goods for another long postseason run.\n\n December 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 2164\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It wasn't a prediction.It was just something Mike Kern believed.\n\"If we can get out of the region, I think we have a good shot at states,\" Kern said of Queen Anne's County High's girls soccer team.\nThat was at the outset of the season. The Lions did get out of the region, then went on to become the first Bayside Conference school ever to win a girls state soccer championship.\nNow, as the girls basketball season approaches tip-off, Kern again strongly believes if Queen Anne's can get out of its region, it has a chance to do well at the state level.\n\"We're very multi-dimensional,\" Kern said. \"All of our guards can penetrate and shoot. And then our post players are very dangerous inside. They move well. They're very athletic. So I think the sky's the limit for them. The biggest thing is play as a team. We learned that in soccer. If we play as a team and aren't selfish, and do the little things, I think we can do really well.\"\nGetting out of the Class 2A East Region II could prove more difficult than in soccer. Kent Island still has Sydney Riska and Lacey Dauses. Wicomico returns the bulk of the team that handed the Lions their only three losses last season, including bouts for the Bayside Conference and 2A East Region II championships. And Parkside has improved.\nBut this Queen Anne's team is different.\nNot only does Kern return the majority of a team that went 20-3 and won the North Bayside championship, he welcomes two additions who have the potential to be impact players in juniors Damya Henry, a transfer from Cambridge-South Dorchester, and Cheyanne Hollis — daughter of Queen Anne's boys head coach Jeff Hollis — who has been sidelined by injury the past two seasons.\n\"With our core coming back, plus those additions, I think we stand a good chance of challenging them this year,\" Kern said of Wicomico. \"Damya gives us that defensive pressure. She reads well. Anticipates well. And she's quick. So she definitely helps on the defensive end.\n\"And Chayenne, she's a true post player; and that will free up Bea (Holthaus) and Lucy (Taylor) a little bit having her in there,\" Kern continued.\nThen there's the core group. Seniors RJ Ensor and Lucy Taylor return along with sophomores Laila Coles, Kariana Hickson, and Holthaus, the 2023 North Bayside Player of the Year.\n\"The thing about our team right now, I feel like we can score so many different ways,\" Kern said. \"We have pretty good shooters. We can get the ball inside. We can drive. We're a very multi-dimensional team. And Bea herself is very multi-dimensional. She can play outside, go inside. She can drive.\n\"I'm not worried about us being able to score this year,\" Kern added. \"My biggest focus so far is making sure we play good defense. One of the things that we've done well over the years is we've been a really good defensive team. And I feel like we have so much energy on the offense, that we kind of rest on the defense. And we can't do that with good teams. So we have to play up-tempo defense the entire game.\"\nKent Island remains Queen Anne's biggest challenger, though Cambridge-SD, with the senior core of Le'Asia Todd, Destiny Johnson and Tejanae Ballin have the potential to give Queen Anne's a battle.\nHere's a look at this season's teams.\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Shamya Johnson.\nWho's Where: Le'Asia Todd (Sr., C); Destiny Johnson (Sr., G); Tejanae Ballin (Sr., PG); AzEyera Johnson (Sr., F); Skyla Ali (So., F); Jade Ballin (So., F); JaNaya Stanley (Jr., G); Tonyia Brooks (Sr., G); Aamiyah Wilcox (Sr., C); Neveah Adams (Fr., G); Montiasha Jackson (So., G); Amari Winters (Fr., F/C); Kennedy Bourne (So., F); Kamryn Bourne (So., F); D'Asia Mack (So., G).\nOutlook: Todd can reach 1,000 career points in Thursday's opener against Crisfield, and together with Destiny Johnson and Tejanae Ballin makes the Vikings a favorite in 1A East Region II.\nAnd though Coach Johnson thinks Cambridge-SD can again reach the 1A state quarterfinals, one of her biggest challenges is keeping her team's intensity and discipline up from start to finish.\n\"That was the conversation we had tonight,' Coach Johnson said Tuesday in a phone interview. \"'You all got it. You've got the pieces. But you all don't have the discipline. And that's the difference.'\"\nJohnson also knows her team needs to play great transition defense and create points off turnovers if it hopes to challenge Queen Anne's and Kent Island.\nCOL. RICHARDSON\nHead Coach: Tom Corsey.\nWho's Where: Jaz Jackson (Jr., G); Monae Ross (Sr., C); Selina Austriville (So., F); Tybria Williams (Sr., G); Ella Downie (So., F); Angelina Algre (Fr., C).\nOutlook: Corsey thinks the 6-foot-5 Algre can develop into an inside force.\n\"She's a work in progress,\" Corsey said. \"She's a presence. She's learning, but I'm going to get her there.\"\nThis is one of the younger teams Corsey's coached, but the goal is another 10-win season with eyes on upsetting a 2A school.\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Lesley Staehli.\nWho's Where: Sam Murphy (Sr., G); Serenity Velez (Jr., G); Maia Bailey (Fr., G); Ki'Mauri Lewis (So., G); Jordyn Wilson-Colbert (So., F/C); Myles Booker (Sr., F/C); Dakota Dietrich (Sr., G); Addison Knox (So., G/F); Stella Kabler (Jr., G); Taylor Bowen (Fr., F/C); Addison Chandler (Sr., G/F).\nOutlook: The Warriors are an interesting mix.\nVelez returns as one of the team's top scorers, and Murphy has transferred from Saints Peter and Paul.\n\"She is one of the scrappiest people I have ever played against the last four years that I've been coaching defense wise,\" Staehli said of Murphy. \"Now it's awesome to have her with us because she barely comes out.\"\nBailey, daughter of Marty Bailey, who has come over from the boys team to be an assistant, could be one of the Bayside's top newcomers. And then there is a list of talent that includes Knox, Kabler and Bowen, who helped the Warriors reach the state field hockey semifinals this past season, and Chandler, a force on the Easton soccer team.\n\"We're going to be fast,\" Staehli said. \"Everybody has talent. I think we're going to shock a lot of people this year with the fact (they're) not expecting a lot of athletic people to come back into the program with us having no jayvee last year. There's certain teams we'll struggle with, but I think we're going to be pretty good.\"\nKENT COUNTY\nHead Coach: Tyray Johnson.\nWho's Where: Kate Cannon (Sr., C); Talicia Wright (So., PG); Jane Cleary (So., F); Love Jackson (Jr., SF); Kaliyah Smith (Sr., SF); Ariyana Green (So., SF); Saniyah Jones (So., C); Tameeia Savage (Jr., SF); Juliette Camilli (Jr., SG); Sanorra Parker (Fr., SG); Abigael Lachance (Sr., SF); Emerence Boutaud (Jr., PF).\nOutlook: Johnson begins his fourth season with the biggest roster he's ever had at Kent with 12. Though still young, experience was gained last year, especially with Wright, who returns at point guard.\n\"We turned the ball over a lot last year,\" Johnson said. \"She (Wright) stepped up toward the end of the season. So a lot of the mistakes she made early on we won't really have them this year. So it's going to be less turnovers for us.\"\nSpeed and defense will be critical if the undersized Trojans are to improve on last season's five-win mark.\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Dave Plumer.\nWho's Where: Sydney Riska (Sr., F); Lacey Dauses (Jr., G); Abigail Staton (Sr., PG); Ellie Burnside (Sr., G); Machaela Thomas (So., C); Avery Eaton (Sr., G)\nOutlook: Lilli Dauses graduated and Makayla Kropfelder transferred to Broadneck. But don't expect the Bucs to fall far from the top.\nThe smooth-playing Riska was a double-double machine last season, and Lacey Dauses gained confidence with her ability to attack the rim and draw contact. Add Thomas, a 6-foot-2 center, who could create problems for opponents, and Burnside, the first player off the bench from last season.\n\"I think Lacey had grown as a player and in size,\" Plumer said. \"Obviously Sydney had a big year last year, and now adding another 6-2 center to play along side of her is going to benefit her as well. Who are you going to guard? Machaela's got great footwork. She just needs playing time to get better.\n\"I think we got to run,\" Plumer continued. \"I mean we're guard heavy. We do have a big player inside but I think we're going to be a running team. We just got to play. There's talent there. It's going to take them a month or two to get them up to speed. But they can play.\"\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: AJ Jackson.\nWho's Where: Taryn Brandt (Sr., G); Jasiyah Henry (Sr., G); Emma Keating (Sr., F); Ashley Kercheval (Sr., F); Megan Rogers (Sr., G); Kaitlyn Thompson (Sr., C); Sarah Brown (Sr., G); MyKira Allen (Jr., F); Yariah Dowell (Jr., G); Irma Sanchez (Jr., G); Nevaeh Irby (So., G).\nOutlook: The Bulldogs lost the majority of their scoring from last season with the graduation of Precious Phillips, Chloe Escoe, Ashleigh Lawry and first-team all-North Bayside pick Selaya Garrison.\nJackson will lean heavily on Henry, a four-year varsity starter, for scoring, along with Keating and Dowell.\n\"Getting back to the fundamentals,\" Jackson said Caroline's key to success. \"Rebounding, boxing out, good passes. The basics. So far I've loved what I've seen in preseason. The girls are buying in. There are some things we need to improve on, but the girls are working hard.\"\nNORTH DORCHESTER\nHead Coach: Dontele Pinder.\nWho's Where: Remedy Wongus (So., G/F); Areinya Taylor (Sr., G); Ziya Patton (Sr., F); Diamond Newbill (Fr., G); Sammir Holland (Fr., G); Destiny Wongus (Fr., G).\nOutlook: An assistant at Colonel Richardson the past eight seasons, Pinder begins his first head coaching job with plenty of optimism.\n\"I feel like we have a great core group,\" Pinder said. \"We're kind of in the middle of the transition, where we have some of our key seniors that are leading, but we have a good group of freshmen that I feel like are going to be productive in the beginning. I'm excited and I think they're excited about the change. Hopefully we can make some noise here in the North.\"\nQUEEN ANNE'S\nHead Coach: Mike Kern.\nWho's Where: Damya Henry (Jr., G); Cheyanne Hollis (Jr., F/C); Bea Holthaus (So., F); Laila Coles (So., G); Kariana Hickson (So., G); Taylor Jordan (So., G); RJ Ensor (Sr., G); Lucy Taylor (Sr., C); Sydney Pinder (Jr., F); Keilah Reed (Jr., G); Abby Robinson (So., G); Dillon Simpler (So., G); Lex Kern (So., G).\nOutlook: With practically everyone back from last season, as well as the additions of Hollis and Henry, it's not surprising Kern thinks the potential is there to do well at the state level, if Queen Anne's can advance out of the region.\n\"We've never had a team that can all shoot,\" Kern said. \"We've had teams where we had one true shooter and that's it. We might have a kid who could drive. We had Kendall Moxey (Queen Anne's career leading scorer) who could play the post. But we've never had a solid (team) that can shoot from so many different area's of the court.\"\nThat's a combination that could have the Lions driving deep into another postseason.\nST. MICHAELS\nHead Coach: Jonathan Matthews.\nWho's Where: Jordyn Beckett (So., F/C); Hanna Corkran (So., F/C); Aleah George (So., F); Rebeca Martinez (Jr., G); Evelyn Mautz (Fr., G); Kayla Montoya (So. SG); Olivia Patrick (Jr., G/F); Alayna Porter (Fr., G); Maddisyn Roe (Jr., G); Bella Simmons (Fr., G); Kendall Rosenberger (So., C); Tess Weller (Jr., PG); Shayla Frink (Jr., C); Kaelyn Hicks (Fr., G/F); Maleia Loffland (Fr., G).\nOutlook: Another former Colonel Richardson assistant, Matthews begins his first head coaching job hoping to build on what former head coach Mark Potter started.\n\"Mark gave us a good start from last year for the ninth graders that are 10th graders this year,\" Matthews said. \"We're still working on some of our developmental things, but I think in the long run we'll be all right. I have high hopes for them.\"\nSAINTS PETER & PAUL\nHead Coach: Katie Murphy.\nWho's Where: Avery McCall (Jr., F/C); Annie Albright (Jr., G); Lucy Rankin (Jr., G/F); Hazel Spurry (Jr., G); Emma Hainey (So., G); Kaylin Palmer (So., F/C); Bridget Gilman (So., G); Tara Foley (So., G/F); Ryleigh Briddell (So., C/F); Veronica Pool (So., G); Natalee Lyons (Fr., G); Caroline Jallade (Fr., C/F).\nOutlook: While the Sabres and Delmarva Christian have met for the Eastern Shore Independent Athletic Conference title the last three seasons, Murphy thinks this season could be more wide open with Worcester Prep, Gunston and Salisbury School pushing to improve.\n\"Everyone is a threat,\" Murphy said.\nMurphy admits it's been somewhat hard to gauge her team's potential because she hasn't had her full lineup for games or practices.\nAnd though the losses of Morgan Quade (graduation) and Sam Murphy (transfer) will hurt, the Sabres have a solid core with McCall, Albright, Rankin, Hainey and the continuing emergence of Palmer and Gilman.\n\"We finally have everybody back and we're working on a few things to find out who those (starting) five are,\" Murphy said. \"They want to learn. They want to get better. Working together as a team is where we are right now.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Candy hearts and other Valentine's treats\n\n February 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1552\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The big day is here, and the traditions of flowers and chocolates still holds their spots as number one favorites for all ages.My favorite Valentine's Day memories are of the elementary school parties — the cute cards and little candy hearts. The girls would gather and compare the message candies from the boys.\nWhat fun that was. Then came high school, and the stakes were higher. The cute juvenile cards turned into single rose buds and candy.\nNo matter how you celebrate this special day — with or without candy — just tell that special person (or persons) \"happy Valentine's Day.\"\nHEART SHAPED PIZZA\n1 pound store-bought pizza dough, 1 tbsp olive oil (plus more for brushing), 16 slices pepperoni, All-purpose flour (for dusting), 1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce, 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella. Put the pizza dough in a medium bowl and coat well with the olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, put a large inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Fold a pepperoni slice in half and use a pair of kitchen shears to trim the edges into the shape of half of a heart. When you unfold the pepperoni slice, it will be a whole heart. Repeat this process with the remaining pepperoni, then set aside.\nDivide the pizza dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, stretch 1 ball of dough into a 10-inch round. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper, then slide the parchment and dough onto a second inverted baking sheet. Use a pair of kitchen shears or a paring knife to cut the pizza dough into the shape of a large heart, discarding the dough scraps. Spread half of the sauce on the dough in a thin layer and scatter half of the mozzarella on top. Top with half of the pepperoni slices. Use a pastry brush to brush the exposed edges of the dough with olive oil. Carefully slide the parchment onto the preheated baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make a second pizza.\nSURF AND TURF\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, 2 tbsps chopped fresh chives, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, 6 jumbo shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails intact), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon, 2 tsps chopped fresh thyme (plus 2 to 3 sprigs), freshly ground pepper, 6 slices pancetta (about 2 ounces), 1 10-ounce piece beef tenderloin (trimmed), sea salt, 8 asparagus spears, 1 tbsp unsalted butter. Pulse the parsley, chives and olive oil in a mini food processor until smooth. Thin with water, if necessary, and add 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and set aside. (This can be done up to 2 hours ahead.)\nToss the shrimp, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped thyme and pepper to taste in a bowl. Wrap each shrimp with a piece of pancetta. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the shrimp on a foil-lined broiler pan. Season the beef with sea salt and pepper, press the thyme sprigs into the meat and set aside. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Put the asparagus in a microwave-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and a pinch of sea salt. Heat a medium ovenproof skillet over high heat and add the butter. When the foam subsides, sear the beef until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold the meat and brown the sides. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook until a thermometer inserted into the beef registers 125 degrees for medium rare, about 4 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest while you cook the shrimp. Broil the shrimp until the pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, microwave the asparagus until tender, about 2 minutes. Slice the beef into 4 pieces. Serve with the shrimp, herb oil and asparagus.\nCLASSIC SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS\n1 pound spaghetti, 1 pound ground beef, 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley, 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (plus more for serving), 1 large egg, 2 garlic cloves (minced), Kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup onion (finely chopped), 1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes, 1 bay leaf, freshly ground black pepper.\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain. In a large bowl, combine beef with breadcrumbs, parsley, parmesan, egg, garlic, 1 tsp salt and red pepper flakes. Mix until just combined, then form into 16 balls. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate. Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to pot and cover. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve pasta with a healthy scoop of meatballs and sauce.\nVALENTINES DAY SUGAR COOKIES\n2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting), 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (at room temperature), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1 large egg. For Icing: 3 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsps milk, 1 1/2 tsps pure vanilla extract, red gel food coloring, pink gel food coloring, sprinkles (optional). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nFor the cookies: Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture and mix until well combined, scraping down sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, about 2 minutes.\nDivide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper until it's about 1/8-inch thick. Using heart-shaped cookie cutters, cut the dough and place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart (a small off-set spatula is really helpful when transferring the cookies). After both pieces of dough have been rolled out and cut, combine the dough scraps and re-roll and cut to utilize as much of the dough as possible. Bake until the cookies are just barely golden around the edges, rotating halfway through, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.\nFor the icing: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. The consistency should be similar to that of slightly thinned yogurt and should coat the back of a spoon. Adjust with additional confectioners' sugar or milk, if needed. Place 2 tbsps of icing into each of 2 small bowls. Add 4 drops of red gel food coloring to one bowl and 2 drops of pink gel food coloring to the other and stir until fully incorporated. Using a small spoon, drizzle a small amount of each color over the white icing and then repeatedly drag a toothpick through the icing until you create a marbled effect.\nWorking with one cooled cookie at a time, carefully dip it face-side down into the icing and allow any excess to drip off before placing the cooking back on the cooling rack. Add additional red and pink icing to the bigger bowl of icing as needed to maintain the marbling effect.\nHOMEMADE CANDY HEARTS\n1 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin powder, 1 tbsp light corn syrup, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp salt, 2 1-pound boxes confectioners' sugar (plus more for kneading), assorted food coloring (for tinting), assorted extracts (such as peppermint, strawberry or almond) for flavoring, cooking spray. Whisk the gelatin, corn syrup, vanilla, salt and 1/2 cup boiling water in a stand mixer bowl until the gelatin dissolves. Using the paddle attachment, beat in the confectioners' sugar on medium-low speed, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff, sticky dough.\nTransfer the dough to a clean surface and knead, adding more confectioners' sugar as needed (up to 1 cup), until the dough is smooth, pliable and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Flatten 1 piece into a disk. (Cover the rest with plastic wrap.) Add a few drops each of food coloring and extract to the center of the dough; fold in the sides and pinch closed, then knead until the color is distributed.\nLightly coat a large piece of parchment paper with cooking spray. Roll out the colored dough on the parchment until 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into hearts using 1-inch cookie cutters; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, using different colors and extracts. Let the hearts sit at room temperature, uncovered, until dry and hard, about 24 hours, flipping them halfway through. Write messages on the hearts using food decorating pens. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Safe Chain Solutions to settle alleged counterfeit HIV drug claims\n\n February 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Over two years of civil litigation against Cambridge-based pharmaceutical distributor Safe Chain Solutions relating to its alleged implication in a counterfeit HIV drug scheme has reached a settlement, according to federal court documents.A consent judgment and permanent injunction filed Feb. 20 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York is awaiting a signature from a federal judge, which will formally settle Gilead Sciences Inc's complex lawsuit against the local pharmaceutical distributor and its founders, brothers Charlie and Patrick Boyd.\nGilead is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets a variety of medications, including drugs that treat or prevent HIV.\nThe complaint, originally filed in 2021 and amended in 2022, alleged Safe Chain's involvement in the distribution of authentic-looking bottles of two of Gilead's HIV medications, Biktarvy and Descovy, to pharmacies across the country.\nGilead's deeper investigation into the alleged scheme revealed that some of the bottles contained completely different drugs not used to treat HIV. Some of the bottles reportedly contained quetiapine, or Seroquel XR — an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, according to the amended complaint.\nThe complaint alleged that some of the counterfeit bottles purchased from Safe Chain, which were received by pharmacies and later reported to the pharmacies by customers, came with falsified pedigrees, or documentation, that claimed to trace the drugs back to an authentic source.\nThe consent judgment and permanent injunction will prohibit Safe Chain from selling any Gilead product in the United States, including a number of Gilead's HIV medications.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Gilead will have the right to have an independent firm audit Safe Chain's purchase and sales records for all products bought and sold after the consent judgment is entered, according to the document.\nThe firm will not provide information to Gilead unless it relates to Gilead-branded products or non-compliance with the order.\nAdditionally, Safe Chain will be required to relinquish its rights to over $2.7 million in frozen assets, which includes over $1.9 million of Safe Chain's funds in an equitable trust account and money in the brothers' personal investment and life insurance accounts.\nIf a court finds that Safe Chain violated any terms of the consent judgment and injunction, the company would be required to pay Gilead 100 times the wholesale acquisition cost of the Gilead product sold, according to the document.\nThe wholesale acquisition cost for Biktarvy is over $3,000. Descovy is over $2,000.\nDespite the lawsuit's allegations, Safe Chain believes that the drugs \"were actually legitimate Gilead products that had been diverted into the stream of commerce,\" said August Matteis, an attorney for the the company.\nIn counterclaims against Gilead, Safe Chain alleged that Gilead's accusations were \"false and defamatory\" and that Gilead was \"motivated by trying to destroy the secondary market for its drugs,\" he said.\nAccording to Matteis, Safe Chain believes Gilead sued the company in \"an attempt to cover up the fact that thousands of bottles of Gilead HIV drugs entered the stream of commerce due to poor oversight of Gilead's free drug access program in Florida.\"\n\"There has been no judicial ruling on Gilead's claims against Safe Chain or on Safe Chain's counterclaims against Gilead,\" he said. \"Safe Chain agreed to settle this case to end the legal costs associated with this litigation and to get back to running its business.\"\nGilead's lawsuit was not the only documentation explaining concerns with Safe Chain.\nA June 2023 warning letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detailed the company's violations of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. It followed the FDA's monthlong inspection of Safe Chain's Cambridge facility from April to May 2022.\nSpecifically, it called the company out for not having adequate verification systems required under law that \"may have resulted in suspect product entering the supply chain\" rather than being quarantined, according to the letter.\nThe letter also confirmed that Safe Chain purchased products from other drug wholesalers that were not authorized, failed to maintain records of suspect product investigations and failed to respond to notifications of illegitimate products.\nThe Feb. 20 injunction prohibiting Safe Chain from selling Gilead products ensures that Safe Chain \"will never again be a source of counterfeit versions of our medicines,\" according to a Gilead spokesperson.\n\"This is the latest result of years of work reflecting our longstanding commitment to protect patients and the public from bad actors selling counterfeit and illicit versions of Gilead's medicines,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"This includes working closely with the FDA, FBI and prosecutors to dismantle this counterfeiting network, deter bad actors, and thwart illegal pharmaceutical distribution.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delaware city evaluating ‘Pallet Village’ for homeless people\n\n July 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 976\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n City officials in Newark, Delaware are in the early stages of evaluating whether a transitional housing village of small cabins could be a solution to local homelessness.Council members John Suchanec and Corinth Ford visited such a village in Georgetown, Delaware and suggested that a similar idea could be implemented here.\n\"We truly felt the experience was transformative,\" Suchanec said. \"The approach that Georgetown has taken is starting to shape up to be a model for how you would deal with homeless sheltering.\"\nGeorgetown's Pallet Village was built in 2023 by the nonprofit Springboard Delaware. It consists of 40 small one-bedroom cabins, as well as shared bathhouses. It's become known as the Pallet Village because the cabins are produced by a company called Pallet.\n\"Our goal is to get unsheltered people out of the woods, get the help they need and move on to permanent housing or some form of self-independence,\" said Judson Malone, executive director of Springboard Delaware.\nMalone said there are many reasons that people stay in the woods rather than go into traditional homeless shelters. Maybe they don't feel safe in a group shelter, they can't be with their partner, they can't bring their pet or they can't bring all their possessions.\n\"The most impactful thing you will do for them immediately is a lockable door with heat and air conditioning in a secure community, and that's exactly what we provided,\" Malone said. \"Within two weeks, you'll see a difference in their demeanor simply because of the trauma that they experienced in the woods.\"\nThe Pallet Village does not require residents to be sober.\n\"We do not allow substance use on site, but best practices have shown that when people are in a safe space where they're accepted as they are, they can then begin to process the other issues in their life, including deciding whether or not to get treatment,\" Malone said. \"We have a very high success rate of people voluntarily choosing to go to treatment.\"\nWithin a week of opening, the Georgetown shelter was 100 percent occupied and has remained so.\n\"People see a value in being there,\" Malone said. \"They want to be there, and they want to get help and support.\"\nSpringboard Delaware works with 30 different support organizations to provide medical, mental heath, banking, employment and other services to people living at the Pallet Village.\n\"While people are unsheltered and in the woods, they almost never want those services,\" Malone said. \"They really don't care about getting clean or sober, because getting high is how they survive a traumatic life.\"\nThe average length of stay is approximately three months, and then many residents of the Pallet Village move on to more permanent housing.\nThe Pallet Village cost approximately $1.5 million to build, money that came from the American Rescue Plan Act. Ongoing funds for operation has been harder to come by, however. Last year, Springboard Delaware had to lay off staff when a grant fell through and leaders were scrambling to piece together state money and private grants to keep the village open, according to reporting from Spotlight Delaware.\nMalone said he is still working with the state to develop sustainable longterm funding.\nSpringboard Delaware has another $1.4 million in ARPA money to build a second Pallet Village somewhere else in the state.\n\"We've got the money in hand to do it,\" Malone said. \"We just need a location.\"\nIf a Pallet Village were built in Newark, it would not require funding from the city, Malone said.\nUltimately, Springboard Delaware envisions building five to seven Pallet Villages around the state by the end of the decade.\n\"We have a vision, and we believe that homelessness is solvable,\" Malone said. \"This is not the whole solution, but it's a huge part of it.\"\nDuring a city council meeting last month, several council members expressed skepticism.\n\"Obviously, we all want to be compassionate, we all want to be empathetic, and we all want to help solve this problem,\" Mayor Travis McDermott said. \"But we have realistic hurdles that we would have to overcome, and even with our best intentions, we can't escape it.\"\nOne big question, he said, is where would a Pallet Village be located.\n\"People are not going to want you to use the land behind their house to build this,\" McDermott said. \"That's just a simple fact.\"\nCouncilman Jay Bancroft expressed similar thoughts.\n\"I hope we'll be very sensitive to local opposition that is likely to be an issue,\" Bancroft said. \"I think this idea of making it look suitable to the neighbors is important for this education campaign, for us to take steps that we've been talking about for a long time\"\nCouncilman Jason Lawhorn noted that the Georgetown Pallet Village was built near where there was already a large established homeless encampment. He said it's important to understand the scale of homelessness in Newark to better understand whether a Pallet Village would be utilized here.\nHe added that city staffers are already overworked and questioned whether the city should have a role in creating a Pallet Village.\n\"I love the program,\" he said. \"I have reservations about how we execute it in Newark.\"\nSuchanec asked his colleagues to direct City Manager Tom Coleman to prepare a report on whether there are any city-owned properties that could potentially be used for a Pallet Village. He suggested looking at underutilized parks as well as a piece of land the city recently purchased off Paper Mill Road, between the city's electric substation and White Clay Creek.\nUltimately, the council decided that in order to not burden city employees, each council member will compile of list of possible locations in their district for further study.\n\"You can find so many reasons to say no for something,\" Suchanec said. \"The easy thing is to say no or to convince yourself this is something not worth doing. All I'm saying is take a baby step. Find out if we have any locations in this city where something like this could happen.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said when Frazier was no longer able to feed himself, there were instances when staff would bring his food but not feed it to him.\nThey are not alone in their experience with Mallard Bay.\nFrom a lack of care for residents to staffing problems, residents, their family members and former staff members say they have tried to advocate for the residents of Mallard Bay but have not seen change. On top of that, it has been 2½ years since the last federal inspection of the facility, and the state agency responsible for overseeing nursing homes faces a lawsuit alleging it has failed to inspect nursing facilities and allowed complaints against facilities to pile up.\nFormer Mallard Bay geriatric nursing assistant Deanna States-Meninger said she spoke with Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard about the facility and filed a complaint against the facility with the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality.\nStates-Meninger said that when she worked at Mallard Bay, management wouldn't do anything in response to her complaints.\n\"I would go down the chain, and it seemed like it just got pushed off,\" she said.\nIn an April interview with The Star Democrat, Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) confirmed Mallard Bay had been reported to the state. He said the Office of Health Care Quality, which is within the Maryland Department of Health, was looking into the complaint.\nKey Health, which manages Mallard Bay, originally agreed to an interview and was sent a list of questions from The Star Democrat. However, the company later canceled the interview and sent a statement sharing its goals.\n\"Since Key Health began managing the facility in November 2022, we've worked hard to build a warm, supportive environment where residents feel valued and staff feel proud,\" the statement said. \"... Like in any healthcare setting, we may occasionally hear concerns, but we always take them seriously. However, the voices of those with positive experiences — of recovery, comfort, and dignity are vast.\"\nThe statement said Key Health remains \"fully transparent with regulators,\" accountable to its standards and committed to \"every person who calls Mallard Bay home.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, reviews for Mallard Bay are middling.\nSTEPHEN'S STORY\nAfter a swimming accident this past summer left Stephen Nowlan, 54, paralyzed from the torso down, he spent three months in Mallard Bay's rehabilitation program.\nAlthough he was excited to go there after hearing about \"how incredible it was,\" he said it ended up being nothing like he expected.\nNowlan said there were not enough staff for the number of residents, and he would often wait a long time to receive help or care.\nOn his first day at the facility, Nowlan spent a long time waiting for his medication in pain. He said when he finally received his medication, the staff member who brought it didn't administer it.\n\"She put my pills on my table,\" he said. \"But I can't move. … She put them on the table and left.\"\nNowlan said that when he shared his concerns with the higher-ups at Mallard Bay, they gave him \"all kinds of excuses.\"\n\"I mean there's no excuse,\" Nowlan said.\nAlthough Nowlan said he had good physical therapists and a few good aides, he often found himself waiting for care or simply not getting enough of it.\nNowlan said there were occasions when he spent physical therapy sessions getting a shower from the physical therapists because the care staff hadn't given him a shower.\nHe left Mallard Bay in December after three months because his insurance stopped covering his stay.\nAbout eight months after his accident, Nowlan said he is able to move again but is considered quadriplegic because he has altered sensation in every part of his body. He attends physical therapy three times a week and expects to walk again one day.\nBRITTANY'S STORY\nBrittany Fletcher's father Michael Prager, 76, has lived at Mallard Bay since September.\nFletcher said her father had brain surgery for normal pressure hydrocephalus in early April and his doctors asked him to go on the Mediterranean diet for his brain health. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the Mediterranean diet \"emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats.\"\nThat is not what Prager is being served at Mallard Bay, Fletcher said.\n\"They are giving him sugar drinks and cake, and the meals are very starchy,\" she said.\nFletcher said her father is learning to walk again. She said Mallard Bay left him alone in the shower, even though he is a fall risk.\nAnd Fletcher said she has not had a great experience when it comes to communicating her concerns to Mallard Bay and its management.\nFletcher said she has thought about moving her father to a different nursing home, but funds are limited, which makes that harder to do.\n\"And I'm assuming anywhere is better than this at this point,\" she said. \"But I don't know.\"\nDEANNA'S STORY\nDeanna States-Meninger said that after six weeks working as a geriatric nursing assistant at Mallard Bay early this year, she quit her job.\nStates-Meninger said she made the decision due to a culture of neglect and lack of care, consistent understaffing, overworking and unresponsive management.\nAccording to the Code of Maryland Regulations, the ratio of nursing service personnel on duty providing care to residents of a nursing home may not be less than one to 15. States-Meninger said there was one night when she was left to care for an entire floor of 45 patients by herself for four hours.\n\"It made me feel like I was a failure,\" she said, \"like I couldn't answer all the bells and help the people when they needed it.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the nursing staff turnover in a given year at Mallard Bay averages 71.2% compared to the 41.6% state average and the 47.5% national average.\nStates-Meninger called her job at Mallard Bay an \"awful\" one.\n\"I can't tell you how many nights I left in tears,\" she said.\nDEFICIENCIES FOUND\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mallard Bay has an overall three-star rating, scoring \"above average\" (four stars) for health inspections, \"much below average\" (one star) for staffing and \"below average\" (two stars) for quality measures.\nConcerns with the 160-bed facility pre-date Key Health taking over in November 2022.\nIn August 2022, seven deficiencies were found during a federal inspection, including failure to report incidents of alleged abuse to law enforcement, failure to serve meals as requested by residents and failure to provide treatment or services to prevent or heal pressure ulcers.\nIn an email April 30, Maryland Department of Health Director of Communications Chase Cook confirmed the 2022 federal inspection report is the most recent inspection report. This means there have not been any federal inspections since Key Health took over management.\nIn Maryland, the Office of Health Care Quality within the state's Department of Health is responsible for the oversight of nursing homes, which includes licensure, certification and investigation of complaints.\nLast year, a lawsuit was filed against the Maryland Department of Health alleging the department has allowed more than 100 nursing facilities to go without an annual inspection for more than four years and allowed thousands of un-investigated complaints against nursing facilities to pile up.\nAccording to the class action complaint, the plaintiffs argue that when the department fails to complete its oversight responsibilities, \"dangerously poor-quality care within nursing facilities goes undetected and uncorrected.\"\nThe Department of Health has not responded to questions from The Star Democrat about Mallard Bay, the department's process for addressing complaints against nursing homes and how it ensures nursing homes in Maryland are safe for its residents.\nIn 2018, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Nursing Home Resident Protection Act to ensure complaints are addressed in a timely manner.\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Maryland Department of Health conduct a full inspection of each licensed nursing home in the state at least once a year and initiate investigations into complaints alleging actual harm within 10 business days of receiving the complaint.\nThe bill states the department shall receive 50 new full-time positions within the Office of Health Care Quality over a five-year period. These hirings were supposed to begin in fiscal year 2020, months before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the country.\nSen. Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who was a sponsor of the 2018 bill, said in an email that this is an issue he still has concerns about. He mentioned a bill passed by the Maryland Senate this year — which he also sponsored — that requires the Department of Health to report inspection data to General Assembly committees.\n\"We've been extremely concerned with the lack of responsiveness from the Department of Health's efforts to ensure residents and families that nursing homes can provide safe, high-quality care,\" he said.\nHershey said consistent oversight is important when it comes to determining whether nursing facilities are providing high-quality care.\n\"Regulatory agencies must work collaboratively to ensure bad actors cannot operate unchecked and that residents receive safe, quality care,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Vote 'yes' on Question A — support public safety\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PETE LESHER | Section: Columns \n \n 478\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Four years ago, Talbot County voters overwhelmingly approved a temporary increase in the property tax revenue cap by an \"extra penny.\" Our public safety operations were facing a recruitment and retention crisis because of low pay and inferior benefits compared to surrounding jurisdictions.Talbot County has made enormous progress with the \"extra penny\" on the property tax since 2022. Sheriff's deputies' pay is competitive and sheriff's deputies now are on the state-sponsored LEOPS retirement program, allowing them to retire after 25 years. These benefits, in conjunction with solid leadership, means the Sheriff's Office can fill open positions. Deputies now retire from the department – a once-rare circumstance – rather than leaving to work in other jurisdictions.\nLikewise, our Emergency Services compensation has increased.\nPay for paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 dispatchers is more competitive than in 2020 — though we need to monitor this against surrounding counties, and paramedics are now eligible for the LEOPS retirement program, a popular benefit. The county has stepped its sixth advanced life aupport ambulance crew to a seven-day, round-the-clock unit, helping us keep response times within the critical 8-minute standard.\nThe county is planning a new ambulance station near the Chapel District Elementary School, which will help reduce response times in the northeast corner of Talbot County, where we have struggled to meet the 8-minute standard.\nOur County Detention Center has faced staffing shortages, forcing mandatory overtime to operate the facility safely. The County has responded by boosting correctional officer salaries and budgeted to convert their retirement plan to the more robust state-sponsored CORS program.\nThe state of Maryland mandates what we spend on our court system and the minimum that we must spend on public schools. While the state allows the county to exceed its property tax cap to fund schools, there is no state mandate to fund the sheriff's department or ambulance services or road repairs. And so these critical county services may suffer if the property tax cap restricts revenues and forces cuts.\nAll of the funds raised by the \"extra penny\" on the property tax since 2022 — and more — has gone to boosting public safety. The \"extra penny\" runs out in 2026. The Talbot County Council unanimously authorized a ballot question to renew the \"extra penny\" for seven more years, out of concern public safety costs will continue to rise faster than the 2% property tax cap.\nVoting for Question A allows the County Council the option to levy the \"extra penny\" for seven more years — through fiscal year 2033. Even with this \"extra penny,\" over the last four years or for the next seven years, Talbot County maintains the lowest property tax rate in the state of Maryland.\nIf you support public safety and emergency services, vote for Question A. Do it for your family's safety. Do it for your neighbors. Do it for your own good. Vote for Question A. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The summer tourism season comes to an end after Labor Day. For multiple businesses in St. Michaels, it could mean a slow down in business.Businesses in St. Michaels are preparing for the fall and winter months by cutting back on some costs.\n\"It's something that we know is coming every year,\" Craig Schury, owner of Pemberton Pharmacy & Gift St. Michaels, said. \"This year has been a little more difficult than most, so we're prepared. We pair down our staff a little bit and we try to keep our merchandise pretty tight. If we control those cost, we know we can be alright.\"\nAccording to some business owners in St. Michaels, this year's tourism season has not been as good as previous years. While data specific to this year's tourism in St. Michaels is not yet available, domestic tourism nationally has seen a slow down.\nAccording to Bank of America, their aggregated card data showed softer lodging, tourism and airline spending in 2025.\nSome St. Michales businesses plan shift merchandise to fit with upcoming seasons in hopes of keeping revenues up.\n\"We have less families in the fall, more couples, more anniversaries, more getaways, baby moons once the kids are back in school,\" said Courtney James, manager for The Preppy Redneck store.\n\"So, it's a different vibe in that a lot of people stop on their way to the beach in the summer and they have more families. Boating season also goes into October. So, a lot more people when it's cooler come out on their boats, um, which is a different vibe too. Each one brings kind of a different vibe.\"\nWhile the shift in merchandise and savings is key for business, the one major factor business owners hope to continue to see during the fall and winter months is support from the local community.\n\"It's paramount,\" said Jay Hudson, owner for Blue Heron Coffee. \"We're here for the community, so having the community support throughout the winter means the world. I look at the community as more of the sustainable business model, they're here every day, so their support means all the world. Tourism kind of comes and gos, but to have the community support, not just through the winter, just in general, means the world to a business.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Somebody did make a winning play, and that somebody was freshman Jadereon Thompson.\nFouled with 1 second left, Thompson hit the first of two free throws Tuesday night to lift top-seeded Queen Anne's to a 66-65 victory over No. 2 seed Easton in the Class 2A East Region II championship.\nThe Lions (18-4), who have won six straight since a Jan. 30 loss at Easton, now wait for the Class 2A field to be reseeded, and will likely host a state quarterfinal either Friday or Saturday. Easton finishes the season 15-7.\n\"Really elated. It's been three years coming to this game and we've lost two of them,\" said Hollis, whose season was ended by Wicomico the past two years in the region final. \"So to finally win one feels really good.\"\nDown 32-31 at halftime, the Lions looked well on their way to victory as they outscored Easton, 22-7, in the third quarter to carry a 53-39 lead into the fourth.\nBut behind Marshall Bailey, who scored 17 of his game-high 27 points in the fourth quarter, Easton rallied as the sophomore guard scored on a drive with 4 seconds remaining to tie the game at 65-65.\nOn the ensuing inbounds pass, Gilberto threw a pass three-quarters of the court to Thompson, who drove straight to the basket and was fouled with 1 second left on the clock.\n\"I was either going to get the layup or get fouled,\" Thompson said.\nDuring a timeout prior to his free-throw attempts, Thompson said all his teammates came up to him offering him encouragement.\n\"It felt great,\" Thompson said. \"I had to knock 'em down to win the regional final.\"\nThompson hit the first, then watched the second attempt bounce and get rebounded by Gilberto to seal the win.\n\"He's really not a freshman,\" Hollis said of Thompson. \"He's a freshman in age, but he's not a freshman. He's been building to this point. He's just an exceptional kid and an exceptional athlete.\"\nEaston outscored the Lions 26-13 in the fourth quarter.\n\"I thought we were going to overtime,\" Warrior head coach Dionte Hynson said. \"I'm proud of the kids. Helluva comeback. We had to dig deep. We had to play solid D. I'm not taking anything away from Queen Anne's but our kids played their butts off tonight.\"\nDiontye Copper's 3-pointer with 6:27 left in the third quarter pulled Easton even with the Lions at 35-all. But Queen Anne's outscored the Warriors 18-4 over the final 5:39 of the quarter to build a 53-39 lead, with Woolford (12 points) scoring seven points in the run.\n\"We just couldn't score any points third quarter,\" Hynson said.\nBailey, who was 8 of 9 from the foul line, hit a pair of free throws to start Easton's fourth-quarter comeback, drained two 3-pointers and continuously attacked the rim, scoring or drawing contact.\n\"He's a great player,\" Hollis said of Bailey. \"Hat's off to Easton. I thought their players and their coaching staff did a great job. They weathered the storm when we got up on 'em. They came back.\n\"But our kids made the final winning play,\" Hollis added. \"We talk about it all the time. Things happen during a game. Who's going to be the man that makes the final winning play. We've had that a couple times this year.\"\nGilberto had 14 points for Queen Anne's, Nickai Gross and Hollace Branch each had 10, and Thompson finished with nine.\nRayan Haq had 10 for Easton and Kyree Acree eight. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘It’s certainly over’ for aid-in-dying bill this year\n\n March 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 577\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Lawmakers have tabled a fiercely debated bill that would have granted terminally ill Maryland residents the right to end their lives, a setback to supporters who hoped it would finally pass this year.Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said in a press conference Friday that the measure had not won enough support among the 11 members of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee to move forward this term. Ferguson indicated he was unwilling to bring the bill for a vote if it was likely to fail.\n\"For this year, it's certainly over,\" said Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery), noting the bill would have fallen one or two votes shy of passing his committee.\nAlthough Democratic leaders — from Gov. Wes Moore to Ferguson and Smith — all previously expressed support for the bill, they said there would be no last-ditch efforts to change lawmakers' minds on an issue that is deeply sensitive for both supporters and opponents.\n\"I told every member of this committee that on issues like this, it's a vote of conscience,\" Smith said. \"It's so personal. It's such a tough issue … In order to come to me and say, 'Hey, look, I'm expressing unreadiness, I cannot vote for this bill,' I would honor that.\"\nThis bill, known as the End-of-Life Option Act, sought to make Maryland the 12th jurisdiction to legalize medical aid in dying, which provides patients with incurable illnesses the option to die by self-administering lethal medication. Patients would have been eligible if they had less than six months to live, were of sound mind and made a series of oral and written requests.\nAs the Senate and House considered companion bills over the past few weeks, the issue became the subject of contentious debate and hours of testimony. Proponents said aid in dying was a matter of dignity and bodily autonomy, while opponents expressed religious, ethical and moral concerns.\nThe bill's failure elicited strong emotions from its supporters on Friday, many of whom have experienced years of setbacks on the issue.\n\"It's gut wrenching,\" said Sen. Ariana Kelly (D-Montgomery), a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee and a bill co-sponsor. \"The proponents of this bill have come before the legislature, year after year, explaining why it's necessary. I have a broad community of constituents back at home and friends and colleagues who I see in Annapolis who are gutted … People feel this very personally.\"\nAmong those who testified in support of the bill was Diane Kraus, a 59-year-old Baltimore woman living with metastatic breast cancer. She said she wanted to have the option of medical aid in dying in the event her condition became terminal.\n\"I'm really disappointed,\" Kraus said in a phone interview. \"I don't want to have to move out of state in order to be able to use this.\"\nBut one opponent said the bill's demise was the right outcome.\n\"I'm actually very pleased,\" said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett, Washington). \"I know that it's a very, very personal piece of legislation that affects each of us much differently than (Republicans) to (Democrats) or rural to suburban … There's just people (who) weren't comfortable moving forward.\"\nWhile the bill has met its end for this session, lawmakers said they anticipate reintroducing aid-in-dying legislation in upcoming terms.\n\"This is one that in time, maybe things will change with more education and more discussion,\" Ferguson said. \"And so it's best to just know that it's just not happening this year.\"\nAngelique Gingras contributed reporting for this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore says budget will balance, protect school funding\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 930\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore unveiled a budget proposal on Wednesday that would balance the books and protect the state's ambitious reform plan for Maryland public schools, without raising taxes in the fiscal year that begins in July.The $63.1 billion plan would balance the books where officials had projected a shortfall, in part by returning some programs to spending levels closer to those of the pre-pandemic era. The plan proposes leveraging state debt and dipping into rainy day funds.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's sweeping education plan of 2021, will be fully funded, state budget officials said Wednesday. Moore, a Democrat, said his administration crafted the budget plan in partnership with lawmakers, community leaders and other \"village elders.\"\n\"We wanted to make sure that this proposed budget had everyone's fingerprints on it,\" Moore said in his public announcement of the new plan. \"Because this budget is not just a reflection of an administration. This budget is a reflection of our shared aspiration.\"\nThose aspirations will now go to the Maryland General Assembly for debate. Lawmakers have set a target of early April for passing a budget, and the state Constitution requires that it be balanced.\nBut the joint Republican Caucus will look closely at where funding transfers in the proposed budget are coming from, House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told Capital News Service.\nWhile he said he is pleased that the Moore administration kept total spending similar to that of years past, he expressed concerns about the possibility of fees for certain businesses or tax hikes down the road. Buckel said he'll keep worrying about that possibility until the legislature adjourns.\n\"All in all, it's a mixed bag, I think, and we'll look forward to working with the governor and working with the Democratic leadership here to try to make the budget as good as possible,\" Buckel said.\nSenate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey suggested he worries about the possibility of fee increases down the road.\n\"While it is a relief that the governor's budget spends less than last year and does not raise taxes, the number of fee increases proposed by his administration through legislation and the regulatory process is concerning,\" said Hershey, a Republican representing Kent, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Caroline, in an email release. He and other Republicans contend fee hikes are coming through the administrative pipeline.\n\"Taxes aren't the only way to raise revenue,\" Hershey said, \"and state government should not be in the business of nickel and diming Maryland's families and small businesses.\"\nThe only fee increases currently in the budget plan are in the Department of the Environment, and those would generate roughly $3.5 million in revenue, according to a spokesman for the governor's office.\nWorking together to approve a balanced budget had been shaping up as no easy task. The state's spending had been projected to outpace revenues starting in the coming fiscal year, according to a recent report from the Department of Legislative Services.\nBut Moore has now proposed a plan that would instead balance the 2025 budget, saying it is a step in the right direction toward addressing the state's structural deficit in the years beyond that.\nHis budget flips the expected cash shortfall of $1.1 billion to a positive cash balance of $103 million in fiscal 2025, according to Helene Grady, Maryland's secretary of budget and management.\nMoore said his budget prioritizes public safety, affordable housing, child care, education and public service. It also raises pay for state employees.\n\"We know that budgets, they're moral documents,\" Moore said. \"Where we choose to invest actually defines our values. And it dictates the course of our future.\"\nState budget officials said they avoided wide-ranging cuts across the board, hiring freezes or salary freezes. Rather, state agency heads went through an intense process and found areas to trim, and several agency budgets will be lower this year than they were the year before.\nMoore said he proposed a record $127 million for local police agencies, citing the importance of supporting law enforcement and getting \"more boots on the ground\" to solve crimes and keep repeat offenders off the streets. Other investments would go toward the prevention of gun violence and support for crime victims.\nWhile addressing public safety, Moore acknowledged the debates about juvenile justice likely to come during the legislative session, announcing an increase in funding to the Department of Juvenile Services. He didn't specifically discuss any cuts made to juvenile services programs.\nAffordable housing and child care would receive significant funding under the proposal. Those are two areas Moore claimed are the biggest strains on Maryland residents. Access to housing and child care allow for increased participation in the workforce as Maryland tries to grow its economy, he argued.\n\"Access to child care doesn't just affect your child and your family,\" Moore said. \"It changes the trajectory of our state's fiscal health.\"\nOptions for job training in innovative industries and public service were a priority. Through Moore's budget, the state is on track to increase the number of Service Year Option and Maryland Corps participants to 500, as required by law.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future will be fully funded in the coming fiscal year, budget officials said, but its money problems are far from resolved. Prior to the beginning of the legislative session, the Department of Legislative Services report projected the state would exhaust the Blueprint balance in fiscal 2027.\n\"It's not inaccurate to say, 'Hey, we funded the Blueprint, or at least the state's portion of the Blueprint, for today,'\" Buckel said. \"But I also think it's completely honest to say the blueprint looming large over the next four or five years, blows billion-dollar holes into our state budget.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Reese has LSU in contention for a second straight national championship. Bueckers is finally healthy and doing things on the court for UConn reminiscent of her freshman season when she was the AP Player of the Year.\nThrow in a few stellar freshmen like JuJu Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo and the game is reaching heights it's never seen.\n\"One thousand percent we've seen a shift in just the perception of women's college basketball in general,\" USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \"It doesn't have to be at the detriment of men's college basketball. The increased coverage and star power these players have; they are legitimate, popcorn-worthy type of players.\"\nFor countless seasons, the buzz around the NCAA tournaments have often been on the men's game. The one-and-done stars, the juggernaut blueblood programs, the buzzer beaters and athleticism all getting more attention. The women's game has pretty much all of that too, and the ratings and attendance this season suggest casual fans are fully engaged with a game that boasts star power and an increasingly high level of play.\nIt helps that the women's players stick around for three, four or even five years without the chance to leave early for the pros so fans get to know them and watch them grow. Three years ago, Clark said she thought women's players should be allowed to turn pro after their freshman year, like the men can.\nInstead, she stuck around and had a record-setting year that grabbed the nation's attention.\n\"It's really, really evident that there's stars out there in this game,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \"Whereas before I think they were there, but nobody wanted to acknowledge it and appreciate it as much. ... They're just really good. Everybody is going around telling everybody how good they are. They're all visible.\"\nESPN said it just saw the most watched women's college basketball regular season in more than 15 years, with viewership up 37% on its platforms from last season. That doesn't really even include the Clark effect as Iowa's star wasn't on the network much this season. Iowa's ratings on Fox Sports were the highest in a generation.\nESPN plans to show all of Iowa's games, including a few on ABC, as far as the No. 1 seed advances in the tourney.\n\"It's not just UConn and Tennessee on TV,\" Auriemma said. \"Those kids are on TV a lot. They're in the limelight a lot. They know how to handle it because they're used to it now.\"\nClark, who broke the NCAA all-time scoring record this season, has helped six different networks reach all-time viewership marks for women's basketball over the past year, starting with last season's NCAA championship game that drew nearly 10 million viewers.\n\"I kind of get to be in the spotlight and I get to change people's viewpoint of how they see women's basketball,\" Clark said before the season. \"The amount of people that have come up to me and said, 'I've never watched women's basketball before before you and your team ... .' Some people could take that as a negative. But to me that's a positive. We're finally getting them to turn on the TV and watch it, but not only watch it once. They're coming back for more.\"\nPeople aren't just watching, they are also coming to games too. All five of the power conferences had huge crowds for their tournaments. The SEC and Big Ten had their best attendance ever. The Pac-12, ACC and Big 12 weren't far behind.\n\"The big names continue to put up big numbers and people are watching and the media is paying attention,\" Bueckers said. \"The tournament will be great and will continue the rise of women's basketball.\"\nFans who pack the arenas are also sticking around afterward, hoping to get a coveted autograph. The importance of the moment isn't lost on the game's stars. Clark, Reese, Bueckers, Watkins and many others spend time postgame signing and taking pictures with not only young girls, but boys, too.\n\"There were 400 people in the stands before she got here and now we're selling out,\" Gottlieb said of Watkins. \"We've got NBA players who want to see her, WNBA players, musicians and actors too. Regular fans also, it's a diversified crowd. Little boys and girls who ask me if I know JuJu. Could they meet Juju? Grown men you run into in downtown LA.\"\nEven when Clark leaves for the WNBA after the NCAA Tournament, the future of women's basketball is still strong with Bueckers, Watkins, Hidalgo and many other up-and-coming players.\n\"It's going to get even better. So many kids coming out of high school are just unbelievably good,\" Auriemma said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chadnee Harris, 33, will serve 236 days followed by one year of probation, with the remainder of the sentence suspended.\nHarris originally faced charges of of acting as an accessory after the fact of first- and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony for the same incident. The charges were amended to one count of altering physical evidence.\nThe charge stems from a shooting in the parking lot of Sidetracked Saloon in Easton on Sept. 30. Officers who responded to the incident just before 2 a.m. found Smith in the parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound to the head. Smith was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was pronounced dead.\nOn May 20, Kevron Chase, 35, of Cambridge, pled guilty to first-degree murder for Smith's death. A sentencing hearing for Chase is set for July 19.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in charging documents, police said the bar's security camera footage showed Chase and Harris standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.\nAccording to the documents, Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed it at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.\nAfter a fight broke out, Harris reportedly walked toward the men. A crowd that had gathered quickly dispersed. According to the charging documents, Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him. The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.\nAt Chase's plea hearing on May 20, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said Chase then left the scene and drove to Cambridge, where he disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River.\nChase and Harris were later found during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. They were both detained by police. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Math proficiency spiked year-to-year for fourth, sixth and seventh grades, but the number of students proficient algebra significantly fell.\nThe deeper dive came after the state released test score data for the 2024-2025 school year last month. While proficiency rates increased statewide, Talbot County students saw mixed results. English proficiency dropped to 45.4%, 16th in the state and the largest year-to-year decrease (1.9%) of all districts.\nIn math, 18.9% of students were proficient, 18th in the state and nearly even with the previous year's mark. Other counties, such as Dorchester, saw notable gains, rising spots in the statewide rankings.\nTwo days after the Sept. 15 work session, Talbot Board of Ed Member Deborah Bridges said at a monthly meeting that the district's results kept her up at night.\n\"After our work session on Monday night, I couldn't sleep,\" Bridges said. \"Our scores, it upset me so much. And I wondered, what are we missing? What is going on in our schools?\"\nBoard members largely agreed that the results aren't a matter of pointing fingers at teachers or staff. Instead, they are focused finding solutions to fix some of the problem areas.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said at the work session that she hopes school officials can begin to pinpoint some reasons behind the data trends.\n\"If I look at us, and we're going down, whereas a neighboring county who has a similar population of kids and they're going up, I want to know why,\" Jackson said.\nEinhorn said while the state tests are an \"important measure,\" it's one of many ways to assess academic achievement and growth.\n\"This is one assessment given at a single period of time, which does not always accurately reflect what students know and what they're able to do overall,\" Einhorn said.\nENGLISH\nFifth and tenth grades suffered the largest proficiency drops of 5.6% and 10%, respectively. But fourth grade proficiency rose to 50% in the most recent results. And while third grade proficiency dipped from last year's 47.9% mark, it's still at 43.6%, an improvement over a 35% rate two years ago.\n\"This really speaks to the work that this board has invested in early literacy, and starting to see that trend move up,\" Einhorn said at the work session.\nMeanwhile, most student groups followed the district's overall trend of slightly decreasing in English proficiency. Asian students fell from 68.9% to 51.2%, while Talbot's multilingual learners dropped from 8.7% to 5.1%.\nMATH\nOne of the sharpest drops came in Algebra II proficiency: 32.8% of students passed the state test in 2023-2024; only 7.1% passed in 2024-2025.\nEinhorn acknowledged that as an \"area of need.\" She noted that new math standards for K-8 will go into effect next school year. And in two years, the district will begin integrated algebra courses, infusing geometry concepts, she said.\nFourth grade rose nearly six percentage points to 32% proficiency this past year, while seventh grade had a similar hike from 11% to 17%.\nBy student group, one result stood out: Black students in the district remain under 5% proficient in math. Einhorn admitted the shortcoming.\n\"The less than 5% is indicating that we are still underserving our Black students and that we still need to continue looking at strategies that better prepare them to show what they know and are able to do in mathematics,\" Einhorn said.\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry said she'd like to see the district work with community partners to specifically tackle the gap in math proficiency for Black students.\nBoard members thanked Einhorn for presenting the detailed trends, acknowledging that there's work to be done to get some of the numbers going in a positive direction.\n\"We have to do better, and we're open to hear how we're going to do that,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stepping into the past - Museum explores Tubman's life through murals\n\n December 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - In the back of the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street, one wall acts as a window into Tubman's life.Inside the museum, on one side of the wall, Tubman is painted as a young girl, about 13-years-old, at the Bucktown General Store.\n\"This was a pivotal time in her life,\" Linda Harris, the museum's director of events and docent, said. \"It was considered her first act of defiance.\" Outside the museum, on the other side of the wall, Tubman is an adult, holding out her hand.\n\"(She's) coming back, rescuing family and those that wanted freedom,\" artist of both murals, Michael Rosato said.\nHarriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who was born into and escaped from slavery in Dorchester County in the 19th century, became well-known for her work on the Underground Railroad, a network of routes and safe houses that helped enslaved people escape to their freedom.\nInside the museum, the mural of a young Tubman and the Bucktown Store covers the entire wall - and the other three walls in the room.\nWith canvas and paint, Rosato has transformed the back room of the museum into the Bucktown Store, a significant place in Tubman's history.\nThe story goes that Tubman was asked to go to the Bucktown Store to get something for the master.\n\"And she didn't want to do it,\" Bill Jarmon, president of the Harriet Tubman Organization, said.\n\"Part of it had to do with the fact that she wasn't presentable.\" It had to do with her hair, Jarmon said. So she covered her hair with a cloth made from flaxseed.\nWhen Tubman got to the store, she heard a noise at the backdoor and saw a young boy struggling to get away from his master. When the boy escapes and runs toward the door, Tubman is told to stop him. But she doesn't. She steps out of the way to let him go through. \"Her first act of defiance,\" as Harris said.\nAs the boy escaped, Jarmon said, a two-pound weight was thrown at him.\nHowever, the weight hit Tubman in the forehead instead, knocking her unconscious.\nHarris considers Tubman's head wrap to be a very important piece of this story.\n\"She wraps her head in this linen made of flaxseed, which in fact - what I'm reading and what I believe now - cushions the blow from that two-pound weight being hurled at her,\" Harris said.\n\"Imagine if she had fixed her hair that day. She'd be dead.\" Sitting in the back room of the museum Wednesday, Dec. 20, Jarmon and Harris pointed to different parts of the room as they told the story. When they officially open this part of the museum - which they hope to do in January - visitors will feel even more immersed in the story.\nThey plan to put in wood floors and counters to resemble the store. And as they tell the story of Tubman's first act of defiance, Harris said she and her husband will play code songs, songs enslaved people used to share messages.\nEventually, Harris hopes to offer virtual reality goggles to visitors when they enter the room.\n\"We're going to make this thing come alive,\" she said.\nThe idea to do this all started when Harris learned that she would no longer be able to take visitors on tours inside the original Bucktown Store.\nHarris said that considering how pivotal the store was in Tubman's life, she couldn't have people visit and not learn the story.\n\"So I said, 'Well, let's put it in the museum,'\" Harris said.\nTo begin the project, Rosato, who lives in Church Creek and has been an artist for 33 years, went to the store and took photos of the walls.\n\"Every square inch of the walls and what was on the shelves,\" he said.\nAfter that, he took the photos back to his studio on Race Street and put paint to canvas.\n\"(I) just started to recreate the store as close as possible and in a somewhat realistic fashion so when you're in that space you feel as though you can take things off the shelves,\" he said.\nAfter completing each wall on the canvas, he would bring the canvases to the museum and glue them to the walls so that it looked as if he had painted directly on walls of the museum. To make it look as realistic as possible, Rosato had to consider light, shadow and perspective.\n\"When you create a painting that you want to look real and dimensional, you have to understand perspective and find the right vanishing point,\" he said.\n\"So when you're standing right in the middle of that room, every wall you look at, all the lines converge to a certain point. And that's what gives it a sense of depth.\" The project, which Rosato worked on in the fall, took between one and two months to complete.\nHe said that once it is open to visitors, he hopes they will get a sense of the rich history of Tubman's experience in Dorchester County.\n\"The possibility of being able to stand there and reflect back like, 'I'm in the store where she is.\nThis is what happened,'\" he said. \"And then going outside and seeing (adult) Harriet Tubman. This is the outcome.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center director of events and docent Linda Harris and Harriet Tubman Organization President Bill Jarmon pose in front of the new mural in the museum in Cambridge on Dec. 20.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n The mural inside the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street in Cambridge on Dec. 20.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n The mural inside the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street in Cambridge depicts the story of Tubman's \"first act of defiance.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners pass bills, approve roads projects\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 532\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Road paving projects, legislative picks and pans, and zoning decisions formed the bulk of the Caroline County Commission meeting at 9 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 13, in Denton.After a lengthy discussion with Deputy County Administrator Daniel Fox and Roads Superintendent Bryan North, the commissioners settled on beginning paving projects for two county roads.\nWolf Road near Henderson and a short dirt section of Jones Corner Road at Concord will be paved with tar and chip, and paid for with leftover American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 funding.\nTwo roads affected by flooding are awaiting better weather and materials. Fox said he will be getting a purchase order to the commissioners next week for $122,000 to buy the precast concrete needed to improve the River Road site. Unusually high tides have prevented work on Gilpin Point Road, although the replacement pipes are on hand.\nLegislative actionsThe commissioners introduced legislation to change zoning requirements for solar energy systems in the R-Rural District, repealing subsections in Section 175 of the county code, and \"reenacting the same with amendments.\" The legislation is Bill 2024-003.\nOriginally proposed in October 2023, public comment prompted the county Planning Commission to recommend changes. Screening requirements, including working with a licensed landscape architect and providing for a variety of buffers were not changed.\nAlso unchanged was the restriction on placing commercial solar on the portion of acreage that was used for transfer development rights. Road right-of-way setbacks were increased.\nThe second reading and public hearing for Bill 2024-003 is set for Feb. 20 at the County Commission meeting. The third reading is scheduled for March 12, with an anticipated effective date of April 26.\nTwo other pieces of legislation were read for the third time and enacted unanimously. Legislative Bill 2024-001, authorizes additional projects to be funded from the proceedings of the Consolidated Public Improvement and Refunding Bonds of 2019.\nThe projects are roof replacements for Federalsburg Elementary School, North Caroline High School and Preston Elementary School, as well as a new HVAC system for the Fretterd Center in Denton.\nThe bond proceeds were reallocated since the commissioners are not pursuing the renovations of the county detention center, anticipating the eventual construction of a regional detention center.\nLegislative Bill 2024-002 revised stream buffer requirements for both perennial and intermittent streams, increasing them from 25 to 50 feet.\nState legislation\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter and Public Information Officer Jennifer Reibly have attended Maryland General Assembly legislative session updates with various groups.\nThe commissioners will send letters of opposition and directives to the lobbyists to oppose bills that \"take away local autonomy\" such as House Bill 1407, which would preempt a county's authority to decide if and where to place solar arrays, Porter said.\nPorter recommended opposing a statewide school emergency response bill, consulting with the Recreation and Parks Department regarding legislation that would require counties to replace certain playground surface materials and opposing funding cuts to community colleges.\nBecause the county \"has been a catalyst\" for lithium battery safety, Porter recommended supporting House Bill 468/Senate Bill 530.\nThe commissioners discussed other pending legislation. To view the meeting of the commissioners, watch the video posted on the commissioners' website, usually within 48 hours of the meeting.\nAgendas, videos and transcripts of commission meetings are posted at carolinemd.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "There are other options open to poultry farmers\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DR. ASHA SUBRAMANIAN | Section: News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a physician, I have been following closely our country's bird flu crisis. I was saddened but not surprised to learn that, within days of each other, bird flu was detected for the first time on an Eastern Shore poultry farm and our country experienced the death of its first patient from H5N1 bird flu in Louisiana.My colleagues and I are watchful for symptoms of bird flu and are hopeful that Maryland does not join the list of states in which more than 60 human cases of bird flu have been detected. I applaud our public health officials for doing what they can to keep the bird flu from spreading but the reality is that the virus has sickened dozens of people, decimated poultry populations and infected dairy cows.\nThankfully, our state is doing a good job of monitoring for the virus. But now is the time to take a hard look at the food production system that puts farm workers in close contact with sick birds and cows, the Standard American Diet that demands it and the health ramifications of both.\nFrom a doctor's perspective, shifting food production away from intensive animal agriculture can benefit public health. Facilities with large numbers of animals in a small amount of space are a concern for public health because they provide ideal conditions for viruses to spread, evolve and possibly acquire the ability to more easily infect people. Intensive animal agriculture was implicated when influenza viruses H1N1, H5N1 and N7N9 jumped from animals to people, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology.\nThe life of a contract chicken grower can be challenging, and some of them are repurposing their chicken houses to grow crops. I was not surprised to learn that North Carolina poultry farmers Dale and Paula Boles switched from chickens, converted their 500-foot-long poultry barn to a greenhouse and now grow organic vegetables. They are not alone. In Southwest Arkansas, farmers Jennifer and Rodney Barrett are transitioning from raising poultry and cattle to growing mushrooms.\nThese farm transitions aren't easy. The government should provide financial and technical support. Maryland could help its farmers with a program like the one established by lawmakers in Vermont who provide grants to farmers who wish to diversify or transition from one type of farming to another. On a broader scale, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide grants to livestock farmers to pay off related debt and to transition the property to alternative agriculture activities. Maryland's U.S. Sens. Van Hollen and Alsobrooks should support this legislation to help ensure that it passes.\nAccording to the USDA, \"Maryland is small, but it reaches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains, providing a suitable environment for a variety of agricultural commodities,\" which means lots of opportunities for farmers. Sweet corn, hazelnuts, watermelons, grapes, as well as apple, cherry and peach orchards are just a few promising options.\nShifting away from animal agriculture helps our environment and improves worker safety as well. Maryland's poultry farms are a primary source of water, air and land pollution. Improving the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is another reason to increase acreage of fruit and nut trees. One way to keep phosphorous and other pollutants from flowing into rivers is to install riparian buffers of trees and shrubs to intercept polluted water running off of fields where chicken litter has been applied. Trees that are suitable for riparian buffers, like hazelnuts can also provide income to farmers.\nI have found for myself and my patients that removing animal products from the diet improves health too. A plant-based diet focused on fruits, veggies, legumes and grains grown in Maryland can help maintain healthy weight, lower blood pressure and improve heart health.\nI know this from my own personal experience and from treating patients with diet-related diseases, and the scientific literature tells the same story. A recent study with 22 pairs of identical twins found that a plant-based diet improves heart health in as little as eight weeks. The twins following a plant-based diet experienced lower LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, and they lost more weight than the omnivore twins.\nGovernment grants and other assistance should also be available if Maryland poultry farmers or egg producers would like to switch to growing crops and planting orchards, which will also benefit human health and the environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Deepening Divides - Democrats Split Over 'Anti-Zionism Is Antisemitism' Measure; Poll Shows U.S. Racial, Generational Differences Over Israel-Hamas War\n\n December 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 954\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday declaring that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism\" prompting a split among Democrats.A majority of House Democrats did not vote for the measure as a public opinion poll from Gallup shows substantial divides among Americans over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza by age, race and political persuasion.\nWhites, older voters and Republicans tend to back Israel in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks while younger Americans, people of color and Democrats disapprove of Israel's air strikes and ground invasion of Gaza aimed at the Islamic militant group, according to a poll released Nov. 30 by Gallup.\nThe congressional measure condemning antisemitism passed with support from 216 Republicans and 95 Democrats. The resolution's most controversial component was plank equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nZionism is a movement and belief system that supports the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East.\n\"Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThirteen Democrats voted against the measure and 105 Dems voted 'present' or did not vote neither supporting nor opposing the resolution.\nOne Republican - U.S.\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the anti-Zionism/antisemitism measure. Another four GOP lawmakers did not vote.\n\"Anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism,\" Massie said in a social media statement pointing to congressional remarks by U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, that some Orthodox and other Jews are not in agreement with modern Zionist constructs.\nNadler, the House's most senior Jewish members, said some Orthodox Jews believe only the Messiah can establish a new state of Israel and the measure can label progressive Jews and others critical of controversial judicial reforms in Israel as antisemitic.\nNadler and U.S. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, were among those voting present on antisemitism measure.\nThe 13 Democratic no votes came from progressives who have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\nOpponents of the measure - which referenced rises antisemitic vandalism and violence - included U.S. Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \"We must be steadfast and clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors and inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful,\" said Jayapal who had to clarify recent comments about whether she condemned Hamas' rapes and violence against women and girls in the Oct. 7.\nGOP SUPPORTS MEASURE U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, voted for the antisemitism measure along with Maryland Democratic U.S. Reps.\nSteny Hoyer, David Trone, Dutch Ruppersberger and Kweisi Mfume. Maryland Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes voted present.\nHouse Republicans overwhelmingly backed the resolution which labels some pro-Palestinian slogans as antisemitic.\n\"More Jews were murdered on October 7th than on any other single day since the Holocaust.\nLet that sink in. We have even seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be absolutely clear: such hate has no place in the halls of Congress nor our national discourse. It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and Members of Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and discrimination against the Jewish community,\" said U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tennessee, one of the main sponsors of the resolution.\nGOP backers of the measure point to a rise in antisemitic incidents and pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian rhetoric that calls for or insinuates the destruction of Israel. They also point to the 106 no or present that did not support the measure - 105 of them from Democrat.\n\"The world has seen a drastic rise of antisemitism since October 7th that is deeply disheartening and extremely concerning,\" said U.S. Max Miller, R-Ohio. \"Elected leaders must have the courage to condemn and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism.\nWhile I am glad this resolution passed the House today, I am disappointed that 106 of my colleagues failed to take this opportunity to condemn antisemitism forcefully.\" AMERICA DIVIDED The Gallup poll released Nov. 30 shows significant splits over the Holy Land war by race, political party and gender.\nThe polls shows 71% of Republicans back Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza versus support from 36% of Democrats.\nFifty nine percent of men approve of Israel's war in Gaza versus 44% of women, according the Gallup Among people of color, 64% disapprove of Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza while 61% of whites backs Netanyahu's efforts to dismantle the militant group.\nThere is a similar split my age with 67% of younger Americans (ages 18 to 34) disapproving of Israel's war against Hamas and 63% of voters 55 and older backing the Israel Defense Forces' military effort.\nPalestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 17,000 people have died since Holy Land war stared in October Israeli officials say Hamas fighters killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 terror attacks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Noa Mittelman, 15, center, and Maya Talby, 15, right, hold up flyers of people kidnapped by Hamas during a rally and march for Israel, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Wash.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Muslim protesters burn U.S. and Israel national flags during a rally against the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A demonstrator waves a Palestinian flag as Kenyan police officers fire teargas canisters during a protest against Israel and in support of Palestinians, in Nairobi, Kenya Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said his last day with the city would be no later than May 17.\nThe reason for this decision, he said, was his concerns with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Cambridge Harbor project, a project to develop the space along the Cambridge waterfront.\nIn a March 19 interview with the Star Democrat, Carroll said he had accepted a city manager position for the City of Lexington, Virginia.\nWith the council's April 8 vote, Deutsch will take over as acting city manager on a temporary, part-time basis beginning in May. He will not work more than 40 hours per month at a $125 per hour, and his travel expenses are not to exceed $1,000 per month.\nIn an April 3 memo to the mayor and commissioners, Carroll said this schedule will economize Deutsch's work and put more responsibilities on Cambridge's Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson.\nDeutsch is a senior associate at Mercer Group Associates and a former city manager. According to Carroll's memo, Deutsch served as Cambridge's acting city manager in 2021 and 2022, and he helped Cambridge with its city manager search in 2022.\n\"Mr. Deutsch has the necessary credentials and familiarity with Cambridge and the organization,\" Carroll said in his memo.\nDeutsch will also lead the recruitment for the next city manager, according to the memo. This recruitment contract with Mercer Group Associates will cost the town $21,800 and up to $5,000 in reimbursable expense.\nBefore voting on the contract and appointment of Deutsch, Commission President Lajan Cephas asked Carroll, laughing, \"Can you leave some of your DNA so it can be replicated?\"\n\"I'll do my best,\" Carroll said in response.\nFollowing the news of Carroll's resignation, Cephas called Carroll a gift to Cambridge in an interview with the Star Democrat. She said that he has made a lasting impact on the city. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Julia Child's kitchen at the library\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Monday, March 3, at 6 p.m., in the Easton branch of the Talbot County Free Library, it will be my honor to interview Paula Johnson about her newest book, \"Julia Child's Kitchen: The Design, Tools, Stories, and Legacy of an Iconic Space.\"Full disclosure: Johnson is a lifelong friend of mine. She is also a distinguished curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Among her many curatorial triumphs, it was Johnson and co-curator Rayna Green that brought Julia Child's kitchen to the museum in 2001. Almost a quarter of a century later, it remains one of that institution's most popular exhibits.\nI was one of the lucky fellows who received a copy of Johnson's new book when it came out in October.\nInitially, truth be told, I wasn't sure what I would think of a book about a kitchen, fool that I am. Anyone who knows Julia Child, read her books or watched her television shows, knows that a book about Julia Child's kitchen is a book about Julia Child.\nIt's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a book.\nAnd the word \"fun\" is apt. Again and again in the book, as people recall cooking with Child in her kitchen or a meal they shared there, the word they use to describe both their host and the place is \"fun.\"\nWhich is not to say that serious labor did not take place in that kitchen.\nThe book makes it clear that Child and her husband Paul were both workhorses. In the early television shows, the sponsoring public television station, WGBH Boston, couldn't afford retakes or editing. Julia had to begin upon a complicated recipe, carry it through, instructing all along, and arrive at a finished product that she could take a bite out of in just 28 minutes flat. The cameras shut off at 28 minutes, and there was no going back.\nTo accomplish this feat of legerdemain, she and Paul would practice for hours at home before a show, choosing which elements of a recipe to demonstrate, deciding how to demonstrate those elements and carefully working out the language to use in explaining them.\nThe whole thing was choreographed from beginning to end and different stages of the cooking prepared in advance so that, \"through the magic of TV,\" they could be displayed at the proper time as if just pulled from the oven.\nYet somehow, Julia always came across as relaxed and enjoying herself. And it wasn't a guise.\nOne of the things I found most endearing about \"Julia Child's Kitchen\" is the way sections on subjects such as the kitchen's organizing principles inevitably end up revealing the love Paul Child felt for his wife, the care he took in setting up that kitchen and showcasing her art. In letters to his brother, Paul sometimes referred to his wife as \"Julie.\"\nJulia called her kitchen \"the soul of the house,\" and her nephew, Alex Prud'homme, called the table where meals were served in that kitchen \"the center of the universe.\"\nUnsurprisingly for that time and a family of their class, the Childs had a formal dining room, but Julia's preferred place to serve friends a meal was the kitchen. Julia's unpretentious attitude toward entertaining (and herself) is made clear in her explanation for the placement of that kitchen table, \"I want the dining table in the middle of the room because, like a sheepdog, I need to be right there in the midst of everyone.\"\nThat statement is so characteristic of the woman we meet in Johnson's book. Julia Child never fails to charm, yet somehow she never seems to patronize or fawn.\nThe book itself is like a party at Julia's house. You meet fascinating people, hear terrific stories, experience a magical place, and, at the very least, get to imagine yourself enjoying extraordinary meals.\nSpeaking of stories, I can tell you from long experience that the author of \"Julia Child's Kitchen\" is a great storyteller in person as well as in her writing. And so I ask the pleasure of your company on March 3 at 6 p.m. for an evening in Julia Child's kitchen, courtesy of the Smithsonian's Paula Johnson. Trust me, you're in for a real treat. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot school board sees test scores, improvement initiatives\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — State test scores released last month show a slight increase in math and English proficiency levels at both the district and state levels.Talbot County's Board of Education discussed that trend and others during a work session on Monday, taking a first deep dive into the test results from 2023-2024's Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\nENGLISH TRENDS\"One of the things that the board is always interested in is how does Talbot County Public Schools compare to other districts in the state,\" said Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership, while presenting the English results. \"And I wish that I could give you better news and say that we have flip-flopped the map, but if you compare this year's results to last year across the state, you will see very little change. There is not a single district in the state who is leapfrogging in improvements on this map.\"\nEinhorn and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district internally tracks student learning levels. This is done at benchmarks throughout the year.\n\"I can assure this board that more than 47% of our students are mastering grade level standards,\" Einhorn said of the English proficiency rate. \"It's just that they are not showing it across the state on this particular assessment.\"\nSome positives for the English rates included third grade proficiency and the growth for certain cohorts and subgroups. Third grade English proficiency saw a significant jump from the 2022-2023 school year.\nEinhorn pointed out that in 2023, sixth grade students were 40.1% proficient. That same group of students came in at 43.8% proficient on the seventh grade test. \"For that cohort of students, it's growth,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said all student groups saw growth in English rates, though Black students had the smallest increase.\n\"We are reaching every student in some sense, in some capacity,\" Board President Emily Jackson said of the subgroups. \"Maybe not as well as we could, but we're getting there, we are making growth, and that's what I want to see.\"\nMATH TRENDSIn math, the district has many initiatives to increase proficiency. Einhorn said the number of elementary math coaches has increased from three to six, along with an addition of one middle school math coach.\nThe district is implementing an adaptive testing program called Measures of Academic Progress for kindergarten through eighth grade to track student growth.\nIn 2023-2024's state test scores, TCPS students showed increases across the board.\n\"We see slight increases for each one of our student groups,\" Einhorn said. \"We have less of an increase for our Hispanic and Latino students. And we still continue to have fewer than 5% of our Black students and our multilingual learners proficient in mathematics.\"\nFor proficiency levels below 5%, the state does not indicate exact percentages. Of the 24 districts, the Talbot district is one of three below the 5% mark in math proficiency among Black students, and one of nine districts below the 5% mark in math proficiency among multilingual students.\nEinhorn and Jackson each thanked the Talbot County Council for its commitment in funding education, particularly the math coaches in elementary schools.\n\"When you see movement like we did in third grade,\" Jackson said, \"I think that we are making really intentional, really important, really good funding decisions that have a big impact on learning.\"\nEXPERT REVIEWSAs required by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future, experts vetted by the Maryland Department of Education will be reviewing school districts across the state. Einhorn said state reviewers will be visiting three elementary schools in Talbot County this year.\nThose schools will be Chapel District Elementary, St. Michaels Elementary and White Marsh Elementary. They were chosen for separate reasons. Einhorn stated: Chapel for reviewers to look at literacy instruction, St. Michaels to review practices for multilingual learners and White Marsh due to success in state testing.\n\"They had significant growth in their math achievement across all grades in this last MCAP assessment,\" Einhorn said of White Marsh Elementary. \"So they want to know what White Marsh is doing well.\"\nJackson asked how the district can take lessons learned from these three schools to its largest elementary school, Easton Elementary.\n\"Can you speak to how we plan to address that?\" Jackson asked. \"How do you take what you've learned at a very small, very specific population and duplicate it or replicate it at a school like Easton Elementary?\"\n\"One of the things that we do even though it's a larger school, we have committed the same types of resources but just on a larger scale,\" Einhorn said. \"So while our smaller elementaries might have one math coach, we see multiple math coaches to be able to service the number of classrooms that we have at Easton Elementary.\"\nEinhorn said other schools in the district will have state reviews in the next year or two. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Because of recovery Whitby learned to surrender and make amends to rebuild relationships. Whitby was able to be the mother that her children deserved and be the person she wanted to be.\nKnowing there were others out in the community with their own similar experiences helped shape Whitby and she was eager to pay that forward to inspire others and be part of that journey.\n\"Today I chose to live,\" Whitby said.\nComprehensive support services\nUnderstanding the many avenues that go hand in hand with recovery, organizations connected the community with the tools for support including behavioral and mental health, social services, gambling help, out and inpatient services, as well as resources for loved ones of those facing diseases of addiction.\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, is proud to continually work closely with community and county health departments and administration to erase stigma and further advocacy said Alisha Saulsbury, forensic mental health program manager.\nSeeing people smile proud of themselves on their recovery journey makes it all worthwhile, Saulsbury said.\nMore information about Mid Shore Behavioral Health can be found at midshorebehavioralhealth.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council passes cannabis ordinance\n\n April 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 532\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Nearly two months since opening a public hearing on the topic, the Easton Town Council has passed an ordinance revising the Town Code to regulate zoning for cannabis-related uses.At its meeting Monday, the council voted to pass Ordinance 809 with amendments.\nThe amended ordinance permits the use of dispensaries through special exception in the central business commercial zoning district and the general commercial district. It also permits, through special exception, cannabis growing and processing facilities in the industrial zoning district and the business commercial zoning district.\nOn-site cannabis consumption establishments are prohibited in all of Easton's zoning districts under the ordinance.\nThe passing of the ordinance comes about nine months after the state's approval of various recreational cannabis uses took effect. In November, the council passed a six-month moratorium on businesses looking to produce or sell cannabis within the town limits, which expires May 9.\n\"If we don't vote today, we must at the next meeting in order to be handled before our moratorium expires,\" Council President Frank Gunsallus said at the meeting Monday.\nThe council waited to vote on the topic while the General Assembly discussed the topic in Annapolis. At the council meeting April 1, Easton Town Planner Lynn Thomas said the Maryland Senate had passed a bill that is different from the House of Delegates. He said said that, considering the General Assembly would be adjourning, the town should have the information it needs to vote at April 15's Town Council meeting.\nAt the meeting Monday, Easton Director of Planning and Zoning Miguel Salinas said that House Bill 805, which deals with cannabis restrictions, had gone through the Senate and House of Delegates and is now awaiting Gov. Wes Moore's signature.\nSalinas listed the amendments to Easton's ordinance, including a separation requirement of a half mile between dispensaries. Salinas said that is in House Bill 805.\nSalinas said other amendments to the ordinance include the addition of parking standards for dispensaries and the addition of a requirement that a professional engineer or equivalent qualified professional certify that that the proposed odor measures established effectively eliminate outdoor odors.\nBefore voting on the ordinance, Ward 2 Council Member Don Abbatiello asked that they change the ordinance to permit cannabis growing and processing facilities in the industrial zoning district through special exception, rather than just permitting it.\n\"There's one industrial area in particular that is off of Dover Road that backs right up to an entire neighborhood,\" Abbatiello said. \"I'm sure that those individuals would at least like the opportunity to share their concerns or joy that a growing facility is going in that area.\"\nAbbatiello said this change would not prohibit growing and processing facilities from the industrial zoning district, it would just give residents \"an extra opportunity\" to voice their thoughts.\nGunsallus made a motion at the meeting to approve the ordinance with the amendments from the town and the amendment requested by Abbatiello, which passed.\nAt the end of the meeting, Abbatiello thanked Thomas, Salinas and Town Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh for their work on the ordinance.\n\"This has been a long process,\" he said. \"It's been a difficult process. And I really do appreciate all their effort to give us the best information so that we can make a decision.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I've engaged in them all, and I value each for the lessons they teach. Losing, when it happens, can even make you stronger.In debate or sport, you must prepare. You must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and you must have a strategy. And win or lose, you are judged not only by the outcome but by how you carry yourself. I learned long ago: You lose with honor, but you win with grace.\nSo I ask — where has grace gone? Where has decorum gone? Today it seems acceptable to shout down opponents, to sneer and label, to point fingers instead of making points. These are tactics we would scold in children, yet they are now common currency in our politics.\nI always valued the end of a contest, when you could shake hands, smile and respect the person across from you — even if you didn't like them. The best opponent was never the one I agreed with, but the one I could respect.\nThe true test of character, in debate or in life, is simple: Would I welcome this person as my next-door neighbor? Increasingly, I fear too many of today's loudest voices would fail that test.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Things to remember if buying or selling this spring\n\n May 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Real Estate \n \n 524\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If someone is buying or selling this Spring, they may have noticed a few new ways of doing things since the last time they went through this process, noted Michelle Abplanalp, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors.There are several real estate changes that went into effect in August related to showing homes and compensation.\nFor buyers, a written buyer agreement is now required. Buyers and their Realtors will need to reach an agreement regarding how the agent will be paid for their services and put it in writing before seeing a home. \"However, don't get hung up on signing this agreement,\" Abplanalp said. \"This agreement can be specific. It can be to see one specific home, it can be for one day or one week, whatever you negotiate.\"\nBefore signing this agreement, buyers should ensure it reflects the terms they have negotiated with their Realtor and that they understand exactly what services will be provided and how much these services will cost, the Board of Realtors said.\nThe buyer agreement must include four items:\nA specific and clear disclosure of the amount or rate of compensation the agent will receive or how this amount will be determined must be stated.\nThe compensation rate must be objective and stated as an amount, a flat fee, a percentage, or an hourly rate. The compensation cannot be open-ended.\nThe agreement prohibits the Realtor from receiving compensation for services from any source that exceeds the amount or rate agreed to by the buyer.\nThe agreement must note that the Realtor fees and commissions are fully negotiable and not set by law.\nThese written agreements apply to both in-person and live virtual home tours but do not apply to open houses or inquiries about services. The home seller may agree to offer compensation to their Realtor, or the seller can offer to assist with closing costs or home inspections.\nFor home sellers, the offers of compensation (when a seller or a seller's agent shares compensation with a buyer's agent) cannot be shared on Multiple Listing Services. MLSs are local marketplaces used by both buyer and seller agents to share information about homes for sale. Offers of compensation are still an option but are now communicated off the MLS should a home seller choose to pay the buyer's agent fee.\nSellers may consider doing this as a way of marketing their home or making their listing more attractive to buyers.\nPer Abplanalp, whether buying or selling, the Realtors compensation or fees remain fully negotiable and are not set by law. Realtors have agreed to abide by the Realtor Code of Ethics and to provide clear and transparent discussions with their clients about compensation.\n\"What's important to know is these practice changes provide consumers on both sides of a residential transaction with additional choice and transparency,\" Abplanalp said. \"It helps to have this discussion upfront so there are no misunderstandings. I have found that my clients appreciate knowing what I will do for them, what services I provide, and at what cost.\"\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

In referring to the recent election, Ms. Gill states that the newly elected Talbot County school board members Ann O'Connor and Karla Wieland-Cherry are also members of Moms for Liberty. Ms. Gill describes the Moms as a \"conservative national group\" who advocate for \"changes in curriculum and policies.\"First of all, both Mrs. O'Connor and Mrs. Cherry have repeatedly stated they are not members of Moms for Liberty; they merely participated in a debate sponsored by the Moms in which, to her credit, Ms. Jurrius also took part.\nSecondly, Moms for Liberty is a support group for parents, teachers and citizens who are concerned with the education of the next generation. They provide resources for parents as well as information in educational trends throughout the country. While I have never attended one of their meetings, I do receive their newsletter and follow them on social media. Plus I have numerous friends who regularly attend the meetings.\nTheir agenda is to maintain parental rights through grades K through 12. Additionally, Superintendent Dr. Sharon Pepukayi, and even some of her staff, have attended three or four meetings. If it was so extreme why would they continue to return? Why is this continually portrayed by the Left as a terrible thing?\nThirdly, I wish Ms. Gill had been more specific when mentioning the \"changes in curriculum and policies\" that the Moms are advocating. Is she referring to better scores in English and mathematics, which the Moms advocate? Is she referring to less violence in the schools and classrooms, which they also advocate? Does she mean the schools' dispensing of contraceptives to children, opposed not only by the Moms but also by many parents?\nAs for the mention of concentration camps, in 2019 Trump was criticized by the Left for detention centers that had been built by Obama. Remember the children in cages? That happened under Obama, too. Trying to conflate Trump with the Nazis by mentioning \"concentration camps\" is actually a horrific insult to the millions of victims of the real Nazis. Plus everyone was trying to escape from Hitler's Germany. If America was so bad under Trump, why did people still risk their lives and fortunes to live here?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He and his wife Kent County Local Management Board Director Rosemary Ramsey Granillo moved to Chestertown when their son, a fourth grader at Garnet, was 2.Granillo found the community friendly and inviting, but he still faced hurdles - first being the language.He learned English and he helped his son with the language.There were additional cultural differences for Granillo as well, such as food, and he sees other families having similar experiences when they move here.\"I was lucky because I had the opportunity to visit Chestertown first,\" Granillo said. \"So I knew about the artistic community in town and that was something that made me feel like I could live here.\" For students who move to Kent County from other countries, school can pose a big challenge.Beyond learning math standards, science, social studies and other subjects, they also have a new language to learn - and Kent County Public Schools has staff members dedicated to helping those English language learners.Granillo said programs like Hispanic Heritage Month are important for both students born and raised here and those who have moved to the area from other countries.It gives those students from other countries an opportunity and a space to share their culture with their new peers.Granillo spoke about how celebrations in other countries are often built around specific foods, activities and games - not unlike the American custom of eating turkey on Thanksgiving.\"I think it's really important for schools to have a space where these kids can show other kids what they like to do in their countries, because that gives you a perspective on the world,\" he said.\"When you are a kid, you need to understand the world is more than Chestertown or the town where you live.\" As part of Hispanic Heritage Month in Kent County Public Schools, there were lessons and school announcements teaching students about the culture.Galena Elementary School, for example, held a daily Hispanic Heritage contest, with questions that students could answer by looking at information posted throughout the building.Teacher Tracey Kendall-Parent works with local English language learners in Galena Elementary School. She took to the morning announcements throughout the month to provide information about countries where students' families are from.\"I think that's a beautiful experience for everybody, not just for the kids,\" Granillo said of the Hispanic heritage lessons. \"And it's going to make these kids from other countries feel like they live in a space where they can celebrate their culture and their identity too.\" \n \n Caption: KENT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n \nStudents dance as Chestertown artist Fredy Granillo plays the Cuban folk song \"Guantanamera\" during a Hispanic Heritage Month presentation at H.H.

    "content": "Local K-9 units work to overcome retirements from cannabis law\n\n May 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In just a handful of months, K-9 Knox is making an impact at the Easton Police Department.The nearly 2-year-old black lab completed training in January. In 2025's first quarter alone, she was deployed 17 times, making six drug arrests alongside her handler, Pfc. Mark Schinault.\n\"She has that drive for her reward, her toy after she does a good scan,\" Schinault said. \"That means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\"\nKnox is part of Easton's new guard of K-9s. Last year, three dogs trained in marijuana detection were forced into early retirement due to the legalization of recreational cannabis use legalization in Maryland, which took effect July 2023.\nEaston is not the only agency looking to rebuild its K-9 team in the wake of the legislation. Across the state, law enforcement agencies are working to fund and fill their K-9 units, which serve crucial roles not only in deterring crime, but also in connecting with the community.\nPolice officers largely agree that dogs trained to sniff marijuana can't be used to detect drug offenses any longer, nor does the dogs' expertise hold up in court.\n\"I really didn't want to go down the road because I didn't want to be challenged in the courtroom,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\nKnox joined K-9 Waylon in Easton, and soon two other young dogs not imprinted on marijuana will fill out the town's K-9 unit. Lt. Tim Larrimore said it has been a \"complete rebuild\" for the unit since the law passed.\nTrained dogs can sometimes cost around $14,000, Larrimore said. Younger, untrained pups are significantly less, though they require major time commitments for training and certification.\nAcross the state, the work of K-9 dogs — depending on their training — often includes drug sniffing, tracking of suspects or missing subjects, and explosives detection. Knox is certified in drug detection and on her way to certification in tracking.\nSchinault and Knox completed more than 60 hours of one-on-one training before she was certified in drug detection. Easton opted to go with untrained dogs to save costs and build rapport between K-9s and officers.\nWhile Maryland K-9s are no longer sniffing for marijuana, Larrimore says their work is more important than ever in combating drug offenses.\n\"This odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search. Now that's out,\" Larrimore said. \"So now you need the ability to smell something that the human nose isn't necessarily good at detecting. It's the dog that gets you there.\"\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nKent County Sgt. Scott Lockerman has a passion for not just his K-9 partner, Khari, but for all police dogs across the state. He is president of the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps police agencies buy, train and protect their four-legged workers. The foundation paid for one of Easton's new dogs.\nLockerman said that after the legalization of cannabis, there was roughly a 60-40 split of agencies that could quickly get their K-9 units back on track versus those that were more affected by unexpected retirements. But he said progress is being made across all departments.\n\"Most of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\" Lockerman said.\nAt the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, one K-9 retired early after the cannabis law was passed, while multiple dogs retired shortly before. The agency worked ahead to bring in replacement dogs not trained to detect marijuana so the state legislation didn't present too many challenges.\n\"We saw it coming,\" Sheriff James Phillips said. \"It was on the horizon.\"\nSix K-9s currently work for the Dorchester Sheriff's Office. Three can assist in patrols and narcotic detection, two work in narcotics only, and one bloodhound specializes in tracking. Phillips said the office has adequate funding to fill its seventh and final spot for a K-9 trained in detecting explosives.\nFunding often comes from grants, local donations, organizations such as the K9 Foundation and county councils. Phillips said it's \"mind-boggling\" how generous people have been in donating dogs to the Sheriff's Office.\nIn addition to purchasing the dogs, agencies pay for safety equipment (like bulletproof vests) and health payments. Departments are also on the hook for vet costs incurred by retired dogs, per state law. For a retired K-9, departments could pay up to as much as $2,500 a year, capped at $10,000 per dog.\nLarrimore, the Easton lieutenant, says that hasn't yet presented a major funding challenge, though it could down the road.\n\"It hasn't hit us yet,\" he said. \"These dogs are just retired last year. They're young, they're healthy.\"\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT\nWhen the highly-skilled dogs aren't working a case, they're often out in the community showing more of their friendly side.\nIn Dorchester County, Sgt. Steve Twilley says the K-9 unit bridges the gap between the Sheriff's Office and the community. The dogs especially help police build trust with kids.\n\"Next thing you know, that kid's come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school,\" Twilley said.\nSchinault and Knox attended a recent Coffee with a Cop event this spring. Schinault said they're very involved with community policing efforts.\nPhillips and Twilley say the same is true in Dorchester County. Whatever dollar amount is spent on police dogs, Phillips says, comes back to the Sheriff's Office \"10 times over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people.\"\n\"I think an agency that's trying to do today's police work and doesn't have the K-9 ability out there, I don't think they're a full police agency,\" Phillips said. \"I think it completes the police agency by having the K-9s.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, BMC has also federally approved pre-established consulting contracts with RK&K, Moore said.\nFederal and state partners have been supportive of this project to serve as alternative transportation connecting the county, County Administrator Todd Mohn said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She will be followed by The Llama Dalis, an eclectic, innovative art-rock quartet that also will perform at FallFest for the first time.\nThe oysters and the music are just the start. Main Street, transformed into a pedestrian-safe thoroughfare, will be lined with craft and artisan vendors and Rock Hall's array of quaint shops. A food truck convention will set up near the base of Main Street, and a Kids Kourt will feature games, prizes and entertainment for children.\nAdmission is free, as is the plentiful parking near the festivities. The nonprofit event donates all proceeds to Rock Hall organizations and projects. The main beneficiaries over the years have been the Kent County Waterman's Association scholarship fund and The Mainstay, the iconic music venue that books acts year-round on the Tom McHugh Stage.\nThe Llama Dalis, founded more than 30 years ago by brothers Michael and Dave Biddison, are a Pennsylvania-based band that reunites for festivals. Michael Biddison, on acoustic guitar, handles most of the lead vocals, while Dave plays drums and sings on the rest of their mostly original repertoire. Bob Taylor plays bass, and Steve Wheelock is the lead guitarist.\nTaylor played FallFest last year with Philip Dutton's band, The Good Stuff, a classic country cover unit, and encouraged the Dalis to join the lineup this year.\n\"We play a high-energy show for all the dancing fools,\" Taylor said, \"but a lot of our pieces are dreamy, thoughtful stuff. My daughter calls us jam band funk.\"\nThe Llama Dalis members have all performed in other bands over the years, but they always reunite to play fresh tunes written by the Biddison brothers and to revive a catalog influenced by the full spectrum of rock music. As for the name?\n\"Well, the Dalai Lama was a good guy, and Salvador Dali was an interesting character,\" Taylor said. \"We have a song called 'Hair on Fire' that comes from a Zen teacher back in the day who said you have to seek enlightenment like a man with his hair on fire. That's us — a little Zen, a little absurdist.\"\nMagee, a multi-instrumentalist, was born and raised in Belfast before pursuing her musical dreams in the United States in 2014. Her music blends folk, rock and Celtic styles, and she has toured with legendary artists including Brian Wilson, Brian Setzer and Jeff Bridges.\nMagee is the festival director for She Rises Fest, an annual event that celebrates women in music and the arts. Her nonprofit, Music Helps, provides workshops for children at Helping Hand Home for Children in Austin, a support and housing service for children who have experienced abuse and neglect.\n\"Music is about community, connection and giving back,\" Magee said. \"It's the threads that weave us together, and I'm honored to be part of that tapestry.\"\nOther acts taking the stage at FallFest include the Catonsville High School Steel Band, returning for its 25th anniversary appearance; Pat Wictor and Bob Beach, blending acoustic guitar and blues harmonica; Kent County's own hard-rocking guitarist Blake Thompson and his Family Band; and the hometown favorites, The Singing Captains, who will close the show with classic pop songs.\nRock Hall FallFest is a feast for the ears, for good appetites and honest thirsts, and for those who enjoy a throwback day of music, oysters and small-town charm.\nFor more information, directions and a full lineup, visit www.rockhallfallfest.org \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stroke of pen loses 75 years of science leadership\n\n June 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. higher educational system may in future years lose $38 billion a year. This is the estimated annual contribution by foreign students. In the school year 2023-2024 it was estimated that 1.1 million foreign students were studying at universities across the U.S., and they generally pay full fare or do work/study. They supported about 378,000 academic jobs.Now we risk driving them away.\nOn April 19, CNN reported that thousands of international students across the country were informed by email that their student visas were revoked. Six days later the Trump administration decided to restore 1,400 student visas. How many students did not have their visas restored is unknown. We do know that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a list of about 300 students that he planned to expel. The National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations in court.\nApart from the money that these foreign students bring in, why would we care? Because foreign students began many of the successful startups in Silicon Valley. We care because much research in science done at our universities has brought the U.S. to a revered leadership position in the world in medical science research.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen this may all disappear. The best brains in the world will not want to come here anymore. Research in advanced cancer treatments, drugs to treat Alzheimer, sudden crib deaths as well as CRISPRs use in treating genetic blood disorders by cutting out a person's faulty DNA will not continue without federal support. The U.S. inventors of CRISPR won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020. We will be taking a giant step backward in the sciences.\nIn the 20th century up to World War II, Germany won about 30% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The second runner-up was Great Britain with 20% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The U.S. was way down the list with only 6% of the Nobel Prizes in science.\nWhat turned the tide was Adolf Hitler who drove many of the best German scientists, artists and architects (some of them Jewish) to U.S. universities in the 1930s, where they were welcomed. The second German brain drain happened immediately after the war when U.S. intelligence invited physicists like Wernher von Braun (inventor of the German rockets) to the U.S. to work for the space program. The U.S. emerged from the war economically, technologically and militarily better than the rest of the world.\nWhat really propelled the U.S. into today's leadership position was the futuristic vision of what could come, if the U.S. government funded basic research at universities small and large around the country with a promise to keep the government's hands off. The academic freedom and competition created by this decision attracted the best brains from around the world.\nSince 2000, the U.S. has won 72 Nobel Prizes in science, of which about 30% were won by immigrants. Great Britain won 16, Germany 7, France 5, Japan 9, Israel 5. Canada, Australia.and Norway won three each.\nThis rosy picture will change fast if the Trump administration continues to threaten leading universities with withdrawal of funds and academic freedom. Harvard University, which so far has not backed down, was threatened with cancellation of its not-for-profit designation. $2 billion in research grants were withdrawn by the administration. Foreign students' and researchers' visas are being revoked. 27% of the students are from abroad. Attacking an elite university may appeal to the MAGA base, but it is still difficult to understand why President Trump wants to destroy the foremost academic institution in the US!\nThe Trump administration also is threatening withdrawal of funds from our other world-renowned science research facilities, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. A science publication asked its readers if they were affected by government harassment and withdrawal of funds. If so, were they considering moving their research elsewhere? 75% of the 1,600 who responded said they were considering it.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen, we have lost 75 years of leadership in the sciences.\nCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York will see the most economic impact. Maryland also will suffer, as we are home to Johns Hopkins Hospital, the site of original cancer research and treatment, and the University of Maryland Medical Center with its world-renowned Shock Trauma Center. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It aims to address the growing need for modern and efficient detention facilities in the region, where counties are struggling to finance renovations or replacements of their aging detention facilities.\nThe commissioners said they still have not received exact numbers for how much everything will cost and how much the county will save by joining the agreement with the other counties.\nCaroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter suggested that the county should do an independent evaluation of the operating cost.\n\"This decision is going to depend on the operational cost and I'm talking long range operational cost,\" Porter said. \"Would it make sense for us to engage someone to do an independent evaluation of these operating cost?\"\nThe county also want numbers crunched on transportation, employment and other things.\n\"The biggest question we all have is the operating side of the detention center,\" Deputy Administrator Daniel Fox said.\nThe county will have Fox run an independent evaluation to get some calculated numbers to the administrators. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He will receive credit for 714 days, or nearly two years, already served, according to court records.\nThompkins, 26, pleaded guilty last October to one count of attempted second-degree murder.\nPrice also referred Thompkins to the Patuxent Institution, a treatment-oriented, maximum security correctional facility.\n\"I believe that it was an appropriate sentence,\" said Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin, who prosecuted the case. \"Unfortunately, the mental health system is broken and failed both the victim and Mr. Thompkins.\"\nThompkins' defense attorney, Jesse Hicks, could not be reached for comment.\nThursday's sentence comes nearly two years after the young woman was stabbed near Holly Park Drive and Gilpin Point Road in Preston shortly before 3 p.m. on Feb. 17, 2022.\nDuring the Oct. 30 plea hearing, Franklin said trash collection workers near the scene first saw the woman sitting in the driver's seat of her vehicle with a man, later identified as Thompkins, seated behind her.\nThompkins began striking the woman with his fists, then brandished a knife to stab her neck.\nThe woman ran from her vehicle and collapsed in the front yard of a nearby house. Thompkins cradled her while holding the knife to his own throat, Franklin said.\nA witness attempted to help the victim, but Thompkins threatened them, pointing the knife at them and yelling for them to get back.\nMultiple law enforcement agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police and Maryland Natural Resources Police, responded to the stabbing.\nFranklin said Thompkins punctured his own neck with a knife while running to the woods to evade officers.\nAfter 15 minutes and the use of multiple non-lethal methods, including a taser, a state trooper was able to knock the knife out of Thompkins' hand to detain him, police said.\nBoth Thompkins and the woman were flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore for treatment of their injuries.\nAfter his arrest, a judge found Thompkins incompetent to stand trial in April 2022. He was committed to the Maryland Department of Health until August 2023, then transferred back to a local detention center upon being found competent, according to court filings.\nFollowing his release, Thompkins will be placed on five years of supervised probation. He will also be required to complete mental health treatment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Council member Lynn Mielke originally brought forth the resolution earlier this summer.\nMielke said she's pleased the task force was established and looks forward to serving on the body. Council Vice President Pete Lesher thanked Mielke for leading the effort.\n\"I look forward to working with the folks that we'll be calling together for that,\" Lesher said.\nThe task force will make recommendations to the County Council on housing, health care, transportation and meal services for homeless seniors.\nIt will consist of representatives from the following entities, among others: Commission on Aging, Delmarva Community Services, Talbot Interfaith Shelter, Neighborhood Service Center, Talbot County Health Department, Easton Town Council and County Council.\nAt the July 29 work session, Talbot Interfaith Executive Director Julie Lowe cited an increase in calls from seniors as evidence that homelessness is growing.\nIn 2023, the shelter received 15 calls from men 55 and older and 14 calls from women 55 and older. One year later, those marks increased to 30 and 23, respectively.\nThis year, the Easton-based shelter has already received 19 calls from men and 13 calls from women in that age range, Lowe said.\nOther nonprofit and health care leaders advocated for the task force's creation at that meeting. They said it's especially needed to help align local nonprofits, county boards and the health department.\n\"There isn't anybody who is behind all of these organizations pushing to keep everybody connected,\" said Rachel Smith, chair of the county's Commission on Aging. \"And that's what we found is one of the biggest problems. We have all these organizations out here that are doing so much great work, but then we've got to figure out a way to connect so we can help all these people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Harris speaks to Dorchester Chamber after rally calling for town hall\n\n March 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 748\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Hours after a rally was held questioning Rep. Andy Harris' (R-Md. 1st) loyalty to his constituents, Harris told Dorchester Chamber of Commerce members inside the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa and Marina that his office is here to help them.\"We can make your business run easier,\" he said during his keynote speech for the chamber's 79th annual business meeting and dinner. \"We can work through the bureaucracy. Please get in touch with my office. We're more than happy to help you.\"\nEarlier that evening, protesters lined the sidewalks of U.S. Route 50 outside the Hyatt, calling on Harris to hold a town hall and questioning whether Harris' allegiance is to his constituents or to Elon Musk and the Trump administration. The rally was organized by Cambridge Indivisible, a chapter of a national organization that aims to elect progressive leaders.\nSpeaking to members of the media after the chamber dinner, Harris said he didn't believe many of the people at the rally were his constituents.\n\"They're brought in by buses,\" he said. \"I don't know where those buses come from. And we know that the national Indivisibles are involved. So we believe that a lot of those people aren't even constituents.\"\nHarris said he heard from a Washington, D.C., organization's leader \"who knows what's going on\" that people at the rally were getting paid to be there. He said he would not name who told him that.\n\"This is astroturf,\" he said. \"This is not grassroots.\"\nCambridge Indivisible Founder and Chair Michelle Fowle said many of those at the rally were her neighbors who live in Cambridge.\n\"He's just a liar,\" she said about Harris.\nHarris said he will be holding a virtual town hall on March 25 so he can communicate with constituents from all over his district.\n\"If these protesters want to call in, if they want to get on my town hall, I will answer that question on my town hall,\" he said. \"But I'm not going to hold a town hall for 100 people when I could hold a town hall and reach out to 5,000 people who don't have to leave their homes, get bused in by some entity paying for that bus.\"\nHarris said he is \"laser focused\" on working for his constituents and advancing the Trump administration's agenda.\n\"Who also won the district with high numbers,\" he said about President Donald Trump (R) getting elected in November.\nIn Dorchester County, Trump won 55.99% of the vote, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections.\nDuring the rally before the chamber dinner, protesters brought up concerns with recent mass firings of federal workers. Suzanne Sullivan said she has concerns about what the firings will do for the local economy. Sullivan, who lives in Dorchester County, is the wife of environmental scientist Jake Shaner, who was recently fired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nHarris told media after the dinner that most companies layoff employees every three to five years. He said that with federal tax cuts, the federal government will grow the economy so there are \"plenty of jobs for every American.\"\n\"Look, do I feel for everybody who's laid off?\" he asked. \"Absolutely. Private industry, public government. It's a personal family setback. That's exactly why we have unemployment insurance and we have the social net until these individuals find another job.\"\nHARRIS' KEYNOTE SPEECH\nDuring his keynote speech, Harris touched on a number of issues relevant to Dorchester County and the Eastern Shore. He spoke about the importance of the agriculture industry, low-cost energy and the H-2B visa program.\nHarris also brought up the need for blue catfish processing centers to help reduce the population of the invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay. He said federal funding will be available to entrepreneurs who want to build processing plants so the catfish can be considered a commercially viable seafood product.\nHarris said two things the county should focus on are addressing drug and alcohol addiction and making sure every child is reading on grade level.\n\"And we can certainly provide help from the federal government,\" he said. \"But I'll tell you, some of the best solutions are at the local level.\"\nHarris, who lives in Cambridge, said it is a pleasure to represent the people of the Eastern Shore. He said he lives a \"blessed life\" where he can be at Mar-a-Lago one night and eating at Cindy's Kitchen in Cambridge the next morning.\n\"It's like the best of both worlds,\" he said. \"And to be honest with you, I like Cindy's better. But don't tell the president that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",
