    "content": "'How Lucky Is This Community' - Connect Talbot Project Celebrated For Its Success\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; Njones@Chespub.Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA - More than 60 representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture took a field trip to the Eastern Shore Wednesday to celebrate the continued progress of Easton Utilities' Connect Talbot project.Headed by Easton Utilities, the Connect Talbot project is extending broadband to unserved portions of Talbot County. The USDA provided significant initial support for the rural connectivity initiative in July 2020 when the agency awarded Easton Utilities $13.1 million in grant funding for the project.Wednesday's activities kicked off at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova, where USDA representatives took in technical demonstrations and checked out stations designed to show broadband deployment.Guests enjoyed a hands-on experience with field crews showcasing their work, including all components from initial construction techniques, plowing, drilling, aerial lashing and the installation process connecting service to the side of the home.Demonstrations were followed by a customer panel sharing the positive impacts of broadband service made possible by the Connect Talbot and lunch on the winery grounds.In the afternoon, federal, state and local officials gathered to praise Connect Talbot's progress so far.Laurel Leverrier, the assistant administrator of the USDA's rural utility service telecommunications program, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to see the work being done on the ground in Talbot County - the first trip of its kind for her.\"It's very clear being here and meeting with you all and hearing from folks that you're serving of what a community focus your organization has,\" she said of Easton Utilities. \"I think part of it is the type of entity you are - you're municipally owned and operated I think it's really unique, and I think, 'How lucky is this community to get to benefit from the services you provide.'\" Sen. Johnny Mautz, R-37, emphasized the significance of prioritizing broadband accessibility for children in Talbot County.\"To put the power of the internet in the hands of our children is just phenomenal.And the investment that's been made; when we first talked about this, it would never pay for itself, you can't get the revenue or return out of the investment and what you're putting in - that's very true, that's not going to happen right away,\" he said. \"But I will guarantee you over the years, we will see benefits beyond anyone's imagination for what you've been able to do for our area.\"Mautz thanked the USDA for providing supplemental funding for the project, the cost of which has now risen significantly.Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher acknowledged that prior to the project's kickoff, the county's 37,000 residents were divided between \"digital haves and digital have nots.\" But with the USDA funding and efforts from local government and Easton Utilities, rural addresses across the county are being connected.\"This is our proudest moment,\" he said. \"This is delivering on the American promise of a land of equal opportunity. This is transforming the lives in our community.This is creating prosperity in our corner of rural America.\"Also expressing gratitude was Easton Mayor Megan Cook, who emphasized the importance of the infrastructure in providing rural residents with connectivity and accessibility to enjoy the benefits of education, social interaction, health care, remote work, entertainment and more.\"Connectivity, interconnectedness, support, community - these are all pieces of the same puzzle, and they all become more important with each passing day,\" she said. \"It's our ability to look out for each other, and help where and when we can, to reap what we sow - that is truly essential.\"Easton Velocity has made significant progress installing and providing broadband service to significant portions of Talbot County.As of early September, Easton Velocity has completed more than 50% of the mileage construction mileage and offered access to more than 1,750 locations.According to Easton Utilities, 920 of these locations have already subscribed to service and are enjoying the benefits internet service offers.Since the initial grant funding in 2020, various grant funding sources now total over $30 million. The project will now provide access to 4,400 locations and is estimated to cost $40 million.The scope and timeline of the project are reflected on a real-time interactive map.The project is on track for completion in advance of the grant requirement deadline of Dec. 31, 2026, according to Ted L. Book, vice president of Easton Velocity.Hugh Grunden, Easton Utilities' president and CEO, closed out the celebration with appreciation for the wider community effort to bring broadband to the county's rural areas.\"It's about partnerships - we could not have done this alone, the county couldn't have done it alone,\" he said.\"So when you partner with the likes of the USDA, the state of Maryland, Talbot County, the Town of Easton, Easton Utilities, whether it be for the engineering, the funding or the execution, that's how it works.\" \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook speaks to a crowd gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot project.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRepresentatives from the USDA, Easton Utilities and state and local governments gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot initiative.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nHugh Grunden, president and CEO of Easton Utilities, speaks to a crowd celebrating the Connect Talbot project's progress. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm writing to relay my recent firsthand experience with our local health care system.On Aug. 17, I experienced symptoms of a stroke and called 911. The ambulance arrived within minutes, and the EMT assessed my symptoms as a suspected stroke. They asked me if I had a preference of where they took me, and I asked their recommendation. Based on the severity of my symptoms they suggested University of Maryland Medical System Chester River Hospital. The EMT remained vigilant through the entire trip.\nDr. Lukas met us in the vestibule at Chester River Hospital to evaluate my condition and determine whether I should stay or go to another facility for more intense care. It was recommended I remain at Chester River for continued evaluation. Nurse Agnes provided constant monitoring. Dr. Lukas checked back every few minutes to make sure I was stable. The staff welcomed my husband and daughters who remained at my bedside.\nDr. Lukas said I would be transferred to a more acute-care facility and asked for my preference. They found me a bed in Easton hospital.\nBest Care Ambulance transported me to Easton promptly the next morning. The EMT who rode with me had extensive military and over 25 years professional EMT experience. Our driver was a retired Black Hawk helicopter pilot. I knew I was in great hands.\nThe nurses, doctors and staff at Easton Hospital were exceptional, highly skilled professionals with a pleasant, caring attitude.\nI was not a likely candidate for a stroke. I exercise regularly, eat right and have no pre-existing health conditions. Easton hospitalist Dr. Devkota and neurologist Valentin knew this and ordered extensive tests to find the cause of my stroke. They found I have a rare genetic blood disorder that causes blood clots, hence the stroke.\nTo all the naysayers and critics I say, acute care doesn't get better than the experience I just had. I often get asked by real estate buyers, \"How is your local health care\"? Now I have firsthand experience to tell them; it's excellent.\nThanks to all who helped with my care and recovery.\nCINDY GENTHER\nRock Hall \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — After months of controversy surrounding its creation, the St. Michaels Tourism Advisory Board held its first meeting at the Boy Scout Cabin in St. Michaels Thursday morning.During this meeting, members of the board, the St. Michaels Business Association and residents of the town came together to discuss the future and current condition of the tourism industry.\nThe board discussed potential budgets, marketing and branding strategies including combining various websites, and getting a better understanding of the tourists who are visiting and the tourists the board would like to bring to St. Michaels.\nTimothy Law, the representative of retail businesses on the board, said as a business owner he is really excited for the work the board will produce.\n\"I love St. Michaels, and today was a huge stride forward to really understanding tourism and promoting our spectacular destination. I think it's a great group of people and we've got a great diversity of thought and diversity of background. It was just a very positive first step.\"\nThe idea of a tourism board was brought forth during a commissioners candidate forum hosted by the St. Michaels Business Association last April, when representatives of the Business Associations stated a need for marketing assistance due to a decrease in revenues within the last year.\nThe purpose of the board, according to a town memo, would be to assist the town in its efforts to encourage businesses to locate or remain in the town and to make recommendations to the commissioners. The board would also \"work closely with the Talbot County Tourism Board on a unified, regional marketing approach.\"\nThe board has seven members serving four-year terms, all appointed by the commissioners. Membership includes residents not associated with a business and representatives from the lodging, eating/drinking, retail or service, marinas, museums and nonprofit sectors.\nThe members of the board were elected by the Commissioners of St. Michaels and include:\nBrian Ball, managing director for the Wildset Hotel, to represent lodging.\nChris Agharabi, chief executive officer of Ava's Hospitality Group, to represent restaurants.\nKatie Blaha, advancement manager of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, to represent nonprofits/museums.\nMichael Morgan, owner and president of St. Michaels Marina LLC, to represent marinas.\nTimothy Law, owner of American Holiday Shop, to represent retail.\nCraig Bertolett, chief operating officer of COLUMBIA Technologies, and Michael McMillan, associate clinical professor of accounting at the University of Maryland, as two representatives for the residents of St. Michaels.\nIncluded in the board is St. Michaels Commissioner Katrina Whittington as acting representative for the commission.\nOn Thursday, the board discussed the importance of a unified marketing message and the potential benefits of public Wi-Fi for data collection. Board members emphasized the need for a clear target audience and suggested a short-term plan to focus on digital marketing.\nBall said it's important for people to understand how tourism effects all aspects of the town's economy.\n\"St. Michaels is very much a tourism-based economy and it really affects everything we do from local government to all the businesses and all the restaurants and hotels,\" Ball said. \"I think that this (board) is a very valuable economic tool to use to help the town grow.\"\nPlans were made for the next meeting to include presentations on budget allocation and marketing strategies. The next meeting will be held on Jan. 30. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "China has ailments made incurable by Leninism\n\n September 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Vladimir Lenin, who died 100 years ago as of next Jan. 21, was having a good 21st century because the Chinese Communist Party emulated him. For four decades, the CCP's primacy was compatible with China's economic advance. Now, however, China has ailments partially caused by, and made incurable by, Leninism.In Russia, then in Mussolini's Italy, Hitler's Germany and elsewhere, including modern China, Leninism provided a new model of government: the party-state. Except China cannot be both modern and Leninist.Modernity requires social openness, and a nimble response to information and innovations that move faster than bureaucracies can or want to move.Karl Marx's only relevance to the CCP is in Lenin's reaction against Marx. The party-state was Lenin's obstinate rejoinder to Marx, who believed that Russia, a peasant society, lacked the material preconditions - principally, an industrial proletariat - for a revolutionary consciousness.Lenin insisted that a \"vanguard\" party, tiny but enormously ruthless, and possessing revolutionary consciousness, could pound the masses into material for transitioning to communism.Hence Lenin's party-state.Such a state has, however, two incurable defects: All policies are subordinate to the primary objective of maintaining the party's dominance. And the party incubates society's elites, who insinuate themselves everywhere into allocating wealth and opportunity. Absent market signals, this produces cascading inefficiencies in the allocation of society's human and material resources.With Leninist ham-handedness, Beijing recently highlighted its economic disarray by suppressing data confirming it. Having reported a youth unemployment rate of 21.3 percent in June - or misreported what might have been above 30 percent - Beijing released no data about youth unemployment in July, thereby fueling speculation about how much worse it now is.China is misleadingly said to have a \"hybrid\" economy of government planning leavened and disciplined by market forces. This suggests more orderliness than actually exists. Market forces are casually disregarded by the CCP's innumerable tentacles. China's \"industrial policy\" - pervasive government entanglement with private-sector enterprises - is a road to private-sector serfdom.Under the Leninist brutality of dictator Xi Jinping's \"zero-covid\" policy, a single covid-19 case could cause the lockdown of a city of millions, with devastating economic consequences. But most devastating is Leninist economic normality in a party-state. The Economist: \"If spending is weak because households and entrepreneurs fear the party's intrusive policymaking, their spirits will not revive until Mr. Xi commits to self-restraint - a commitment that he cannot credibly make. The party lacks the power to limit its own power.\" In a recent three-year period, the Economist reports, China produced enough cement to turn Britain into a parking lot. But analyst Edward Luttwak, citing \"at least 100 grossly under-utilized airports and the many highways that are mostly empty of traffic even in crowded China,\" says supposedly \"semi-private\" joint ventures are essentially CCP ventures.They are financed by \"loans of the local branches of state banks, whose managers could not just say no to local party bosses, who could choose to invite them to sumptuous dinners in pretty company or to lock them up for corruption investigations as they saw fit.\" Hence today's Everest of domestic debt, (China's developers' debts equal about 16 percent of the nation's gross domestic product) and stagnation. The Economist says \"short-term growth is no longer\" the CCP's priority. National \"greatness\" is. But Leninism precludes this as Xi values loyalty over competence: \"China used to tolerate debate about its economy, but today cajoles analysts into fake optimism. The fact that China's problems start at the top means they will persist.\" Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ian Johnson of the Council on Foreign Relations says Beijing's \"strategy of accelerating government intervention in Chinese life\" - an \"obsession with control\" - means \"political ossification and ideological hardening\" in a society devoid of \"self-critical reflection.\" These are fruits of Leninism.Also in Foreign Affairs, Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that \"the autocrat's Achilles' heel is an inherent lack of credible self-restraint.\" In Xi's China, there is \"widespread fear not seen since the days of Mao - fear of losing one's property or livelihood, whether temporarily or forever, without warning and without appeal.\" This is a recipe for social paralysis.The Leninist CCP is the nation's neurological system, and is making China sclerotic. In his 1964 biography of Lenin, Louis Fischer, an American foreign correspondent, recalled that a participant in Lenin's autopsy said that blood vessels in his brain were so calcified that \"when struck with a tweezer they sounded like stone.\" China's regime has a Leninist brain like that.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Waterfowl Festival looks forward\n\n May 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 815\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Deena Kilmon, the new executive director of the Waterfowl Festival, is excited to bring fresh energy and invite a new generation into the mission of the organization.Some changes are already visible. The Waterfowl Festival has welcomed a new staff and opened a new gift shop at the Armory, which houses the festival organization.\n\"We are laying the foundation for the future. If you think you know the Waterfowl Festival, I bet you don't. I invite people to come down to learn not only about the work we have done, but the work we want to do,\" Kilmon said.\nFor three days every November, about 20,000 visitors come to Easton for the annual Waterfowl Festival, which features art sales, demonstrations, educational events and more.\nBut the Waterfowl Festival is a year-round effort, with the organization also hosting a variety of events and supporting conservation nonprofits.\nMore new developments can be expected soon, Kilmon said, some of which are with the Armory building itself.\nOne of the big ways she wants to begin a new era for the Waterfowl Festival is by revitalizing the Armory's massive space.\nThere is a walled off stage at one end, and Kilmon wants to bring the proscenium arch back into use.\nThere are also rows of historically accurate new windows that will surround the Armory's drill space. They give the whole auditorium a kind of face lift.\n\"These are what the Maryland Historical Trust paid for. So it looks the same on the outside as it did to the 97-year-old building. We have just applied to the county to fix the roof. Once we fix the roof, the vision is to fix the stage,\" Kilmon said.\nKilmon's Assistant Director Sammie Mooney, who has a background in professional and community theater, wants to invite a whole new generation of the community into the building and maybe even rent it out.\nMooney is excited to connect with younger members of the waterfowl festival scene.\n\"I don't think I am trying to develop anything brand new, but bringing in newer people, the younger generation for the longevity of the festival,\" she said. \"We want to do so many things with the building because it kind of sat here. It is an amazing building. We want it to become kind of a community center where events are always going on.\"\nOne such event is inviting in photographer Kristin Rutkowski, who created the portrait project \"Her Helm\" of women captains who ply the waters of the Chesapeake.\n\"It is all about the water and literally fits right in our mission,\" Kilmon said. \"She will be here June 7, and I have another guy who wrote a book about raptors. He should be here in July. That is the kind of stuff we are bringing in. We could show a film here.\"\nOrganizers' passion to attract people to the Waterfowl Festivals' activities comes from the festival's mission and from the land itself.\n\"I love the Eastern Shore, the culture. When I was 14, I read James Michener's \"Chesapeake\" and totally fell in love with the romantic version of the Chesapeake Bay,\" Kilmon said.\nShe said her whole family loves to get out on the water and enjoy the open spaces.\n\"At the festival that is what we do. Try and conserve those spaces and make them available to and accessible to everyone,\" Kilmon said.\nThe organization does this through more than just hosting the annual festival and hosting events. The Waterfowl Festival has also invested millions of dollars into conservation efforts.\n\"We support organizations that do that work. There have been three or four dozen organizations over the years. It is well over $5 million since 1971,\" Kilmon said.\nTheir latest gift was to the Wellington WMA in Somerset County. They are taking farmland and turning it back into wetlands, partnering with private donors, the state and Ducks Unlimited.\nKilmon mentioned that there is a grant program for conservation organizations.\n\"It is a mini grant program for up to $5,000, and we are awarding about five of those. Say you are a little organization with conservation and education and there is no other funding for a project they want to do. We have already set this money aside at the Mid-Shore Community Foundation,\" she said.\nShe invited interested individuals and organizations to go to the Waterfowl Festival website to find a 30-minute application to receive a grant.\nBecoming the new executive director has widened her eyes as to what the festival has done, Kilmon said.\n\"The legacy is insane. People have forgotten some of the players have passed or moved away, but some of their children are still here. What we are doing now becomes even more critical to this generation. They thought it was a crisis in '71, but what is it like now? It is beyond a crisis,\" she said.\n\"What I think is critical is re-engaging with our community and bringing in a new generation to make sure that the legacy of the festival continues,\" Kilmon said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Fresh baked bread on a cool fall day\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE | Section: Life \n \n 1772\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The temperatures are dropping slowly. What a great time to begin making fresh bread.The family will love the warm kitchen with great smell of fresh baked bread. Have plenty of whipped butter on hand with jam, jelly or honey to smear on top.\nIn the winter, I will feature my favorite biscuit recipes. Contact me to feature your family favorites to share.\nHere are six tips to consider when baking your breads.\nPlace a small ovenproof dish with water in the oven when baking to help prevent the crust from getting too hard or brown.Use margarine or oil shortening to grease the pans as margarine and oil absorb more readily into the dough or batter.To make self-rising flour, mix 4 cups flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 tbsps baking powder.Hot water kills yeast. One way to tell the correct temperature is to pour the water over your forearm. If you do not feel hot or cold, then it's just perfect.When making nut bread, they are better stored 24 hours after baking and before serving.Use an empty and clean salt shaker to store flour to be used for shaking when recipes call for it.\nBASIC WHITE BREAD\nWhen I began making bread, this was the recipe I used until I felt more confident. Give this a try if this is your first attempt.\n2 envelopes yeast, 4 cups water (90-100 degrees), 2 cups sugar, 2 tbsps shortening, 2 tbsps vinegar, 2 tsps salt, 12 cups flour.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place all ingredients except the flour into the liquid in a large mixing bowl. Stir slightly until dissolved. Add 6 cups of the flour and beat. slowly stir in the remaining 6 cups of flour and let rest for 10 minutes. Place on a lightly floured board and knead for 2 minutes. Let rise until doubled in size. Punch down and let rise again. Shape into four loaves, place into loaf pans and bake in a preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes. Enjoy.\nSOURDOUGH BREAD\n4 ¾ cups bread flour (or more as needed), 3 tbsps white sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 package active dry yeast, 1 cup warm milk, 2 tbsps margarine (softened), 1 ½ cups sourdough starter, 1 extra large egg, 1 tbsp water, ¼ cup chopped onion.\nCombine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm milk and margarine. Add in the starter mix. Mix in the remaining 3 3/4 cups of flour gradually; you may need to add more flour depending on the climate. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough into a greased bowl, turn once to the oil surface, and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down dough; cover and rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough in half and shape into two loaves. Place loaves on a greased baking pan. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Stir together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined. Brush over the tops of loaves, then sprinkle with onion. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf should read 190 degrees.\nHOMEMADE ARTISAN BREAD\n3 1/4 cups bread flour (plus more for hands and pan), 2 tsps instant yeast, 2 tsps coarse salt, 1 1/2 cups water (close to room temperature at about 70 degrees).\nIn a large, ungreased mixing bowl, whisk the flour, yeast and salt together. Pour in the water and gently mix with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can. Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature. Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles. You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for the absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours — 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That's fine and normal, nothing to worry about. Lightly dust a large nonstick baking sheet with flour and/or cornmeal. Turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9-by-3 inches each about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet. During these 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. When ready to bake, using a very sharp knife score the bread loaves with 3 slashes, about 1/2 inch deep. If the shaped loaves flattened out during the 45 minutes, use floured hands to narrow them out along the sides again. Place the shaped and scored dough on the flour dusted pan in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Gently tap the loaves—if they sound hollow, the bread is done. For a more accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 195 degrees. Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Store leftovers loosely covered at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nHONEY SPICE BREAD\n2/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1/3 cup 2% milk, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup honey, 1/3 cup canola oil. GLAZE: 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 tesps 2% milk.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar and milk. Cook and stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat. In a large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. In another bowl, whisk eggs, honey, oil and brown sugar mixture until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Transfer the batter to a greased 8-by-4-inch loaf pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (cover top loosely with foil if needed to prevent over-browning). Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, stir glaze ingredients until smooth, drizzle over bread.\nAMISH WHITE BREAD\n2 cups of warm water (110 degrees), ⅔ cup white sugar, 1 ½ tbsps active dry yeast, ¼ cup vegetable oil,1 ½ tsps salt, 6 cups bread flour.\nDissolve sugar in warm water in a large bowl and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until the yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix oil and salt into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth. Place it in a well-oiled bowl and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two well-oiled 9-by-5-inch loaf pans. Allow it to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30 minutes.\nCOUNTY WHOLE WHEAT BREAD\n2 1/2 cup warm buttermilk (body temperature is good), 2 tbsps honey, 1 tbsp dry active yeast, 5 1/2 cups fine grind whole wheat flour, 1 cup unbleached bread flour (plus more as needed), 1 tbsp kosher salt, 1 egg, 3 tbsps unsalted butter (soft), 2 tbsps poppy seeds, 1 egg white mixed with a tablespoon of water.\nWarm the buttermilk to body temperature. In other words when you stick a finger into it you shouldn't feel it. Place the buttermilk in a large bowl. Add a tablespoon of yeast and honey to it. Let the yeast dissolve either by whisking it or letting it bloom. Add the whole wheat flour, 1 cup of bread flour, egg and salt. Using a thick handled wooden spoon mix the dough in a circular fashion adding the softened butter once the dough has started to form. Once the dough has formed remove it from the bowl to a clean countertop and knead the dough until it is smooth, elastic and the gluten has formed. Consider this your workout for the day. Roll the dough into a tight ball. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover it with a damp warm towel and set it in a warm place. Set a timer for 1 hour. At the end of the hour punch down the dough and set the timer for another hour. At the end of this hour the dough should be doubled in size. Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll it into a ball and either divide it into thirds so you can roll it into logs and braid it or roll it into two big logs. Place the loaves into prepared pans. I always oil and then shake flour into my pans. The thin coating of flour lets the baked bread easily release from the pan. Cover with a warm damp towel and let the dough rise for 40 minutes to an hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Once the loaves have doubled, brush them with the egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds or sesame seeds. You can also dust the tops with flour but if you do this don't use the egg wash. Bake the loaves in the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, rotating them halfway through baking. Remove the loaves from the oven and remove them from the bread pans to a rack and let them cool. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For All Seasons partners for suicide intervention\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Life \n \n 343\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For All Seasons' Center for Learning is partnering with Santé Eastern Shore to offer LivingWorks ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) on April 7 and 8 from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day at Anchor Church in Easton.This two-day in-person workshop includes interactive learning, hands-on practice, and real-world application exercises to learn the skills to provide a suicide first-aid intervention for someone who has thoughts of suicide. The workshop is designed for all caregivers (anyone over age 15 in a position of trust), including mental health professionals, nurses, physicians, pharmacists, teachers, counselors, youth workers, police and correctional staff, school support staff, clergy, and community volunteers.\nParticipants will learn how to recognize when someone may be thinking about suicide and take steps to support them, to develop a safety plan to keep someone safe for now and connect them with further help; talk openly about personal and community attitudes and suicide, build confidence and capacity in providing suicide first-aid, understand how attitudes about suicide influence intervention approaches and gain insights into community resources and support networks to sustain long-term suicide prevention efforts.\nThe training will include breakfast, lunch and snacks each day, as well as all the necessary materials. Participating clinicians will receive 12 Category I CEUs issued by For All Seasons, an approved continuing education provider for Maryland social workers and professional counselors.\nThe registration fee of $350 is due at the time of enrollment. All registrations are due no later than March 31 at forallseasonsinc.lpages.co/asist-training-2025/. For questions, contact Kelsey Trumbull-Meyers at CenterForLearning@forallseasonsinc.org. Because this training is grant-funded, For All Seasons is required to report program outcomes. Participants will be asked to complete multiple-choice surveys before the training begins and after the training's completion.\nFor All Seasons provides the highest quality mental health and victim services to children, adults, and families across the Mid-Shore and throughout Maryland. Services are offered in both English and Spanish and include therapy, psychiatry, victim advocacy, 24-hour crisis hotlines, outreach, and community education.

    "content": "Country Cooking: Summer snacking\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1108\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n School is out, and summer fun is just beginning. Get those sweets and treats ready because the \"I'm hungry\" crowd has arrived.Ever wonder how kids can sit in school six hours a day with only lunch but when school is closed the \"I'm hungry\" cry is every two to three hours? It is easier to have snacks prepared and ready to hand out.\nBuy a large economy size box of zipper snack bags and fill assorted crackers and chips. Fill another batch with assorted raisins, nuts, dried banana chips and gummy bears. Have small, flavored water bottles ready to simply hand out. I remember those summer shopping carts when I bought the little Kool-Aid flavored drink mixes in as many flavors as possible.\nIt seems I bought mostly grape and orange flavors. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea were saved for dinner time. At one point in the early '70s, with enough package points, you could order the plastic Kool-Aid pitcher with matching drinking cups for free. The Kool-Aid emblem was on the side of the cups.\nSometimes I would mix a package of Kool-Aid and pour in the ice cube trays, freeze and add to the glass of Kool-Aid for fun. This could also be tasty with a mixture of different flavors with the drink and ice cubes.\nMaking lunch sandwiches could be fun by using large cookie cutters to cut the bread. Place the cut-out sandwich on a plate and lay chips and pickles on the side. Use toothpicks to push into small chunks of cheese for added fun and nutrition.\nFROZEN BANANA BITES\n1 cup peanut butter, 4 bananas (sliced into 1-inch rounds), 8 (1 oz) squares semisweet chocolate, 1 tbsp shortening, ⅓ cup toffee baking bits.\nCover a baking sheet with waxed paper. Spoon a thin layer of peanut butter on top of each banana slice. Insert a toothpick through the peanut butter layer into the banana. Place banana bites onto the prepared baking sheet; freeze for 30 minutes to overnight. Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Cover another baking sheet with waxed paper. Remove 2 to 4 banana bites from the freezer at a time; coat each bite with chocolate mixture. Place coated banana bites on the second baking sheet; sprinkle each with toffee bits. Repeat until all the bites are coated. Return banana bites to the freezer until set, at least 1 hour. Allow bites to sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving.\nICE CREAM SANDWICH POPS\n6 ice cream sandwiches, 2 bottles chocolate shell topping (such as Magic Shell), 12 popsicle sticks, assorted toppings (such as sprinkles, crushed cookies, nuts, crushed candy bars. We love Oreo cookies.)\nCut ice cream sandwiches in half crosswise. Insert a popsicle stick through up through the center of each cut end. Remove the caps and seals from the shell topping. Place in the microwave and cook for 8 seconds. Pour each bottle shell topping into a glass measuring cup. Dip each pop into shell topping until completely covered, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the top ends in desired toppings and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze pops at least 1 hour before serving.\nCLASSIC PUDDING POPS\nOne of my son John's favorite snacks as a kid was pudding pops. You don't really see them in the stores too often anymore. Here is a homemade recipe for that nostalgic sweet treat.\n2 cups milk, ½ cup evaporated milk, 1 (3.5 oz) package instant chocolate pudding mix, ¼ cup white sugar.\nBeat milk, evaporated milk, instant pudding and sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour into ice pop molds and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. Also for this recipe if you are diabetic or making you can prepare it this way. Use zero sugar pistachio pudding, substitute liquid Splenda for the sugar (1/2 tsp) and they are wonderful.\nS'MORES POPSICLES\n2 cups cold milk, 1 package instant chocolate pudding mix, 2 whole graham crackers (crushed), 1 ½ cups vanilla ice cream (softened).\nBeat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Measure 1 1/2 cup pudding and set remaining pudding aside for another use. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of each ice pop mold; add about 1/4 cup ice cream. Sprinkle another layer of graham cracker crumbs and top with about 1/4 cup pudding. Add a final layer of graham cracker crumbs. Freeze until completely frozen, about 3 hours.\nTROPICAL FRUIT ICICLES\n½ cups low-fat vanilla yogurt, 1 cup sliced mango, 1 (8 oz) can pineapple chunks (undrained), 1 small banana, 1 orange (juiced).\nBlend yogurt, mango, pineapple chunks with juice, banana, and orange juice in a blender until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds; freeze until set, 4 to 6 hours.\nPEANUT BUTTER BANANA\nICE CREAM\n4 ripe bananas cut into 1-inch slices, ¼ cup peanut butter.\nArrange banana slices on a baking sheet and freeze, 8 hours to overnight. Process frozen bananas in a food processor until evenly chopped; add peanut butter and process until thick and creamy.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 lb. strawberries plus more to garnish, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish.\nHull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries.\nHOMEMADE FRUIT POPSICLES\nStrawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple and mango are just a few of the fruits you can use here. For this one we will use 2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and sliced bananas (mixed); 2 cups plain or vanilla yogurt, ¼ cup white sugar, 8 small paper cups, 8 popsicle sticks.\nPlace the mixed blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, sliced bananas, yogurt, and sugar into a blender. Cover, and blend until the fruit is chunky or smooth, as desired. Fill paper cups 3/4 full with fruit mixture. Cover the top of each cup with a strip of aluminum foil. Poke a popsicle stick through the center of the foil on each cup. Place the cups in the freezer for at least 5 hours. To serve, remove foil and peel off the paper cup. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In today's deal, a defender fooled declarer by dropping an unnecessarily high card. However, it helped that he had calculated his \"generosity\" couldn't cost a trick.\nIn four hearts, declarer won the first trick with his club ace and cashed the heart ace, \"dropping\" West's queen.\nWorried that East had four trumps, South immediately ran the diamond 10. East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commissioners of Oxford table voting resolution\n\n March 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 426\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Although at the start of a Commissioners of Oxford discussion Tuesday Commission President Norm Bell recommended the commissioners vote that evening on a resolution to clarify the town's voting registration requirements, the commissioners tabled the resolution in a two to one vote.\"In order to get this right, I think we need more time,\" Commissioner Katrina Greer said. \"I think it would be better to do nothing and write some rules for the election committee, which we can do without a charter change.\"\nThe now tabled resolution would amend the town's charter to clarify a person must register with the Talbot County Board of Elections to qualify as a voter in the town. This means a resident would not be able to vote in Oxford town elections if they aren't registered with the county board.\nBefore the vote was taken, Bell expressed concern that if the resolution is not voted on at the meeting, it could be delayed to the point where, if the resolution is passed, it is not in effect for the town's upcoming election in June when Commissioner Tom Costigan's term is set to expire.\nBut Bell, who ultimately voted in favor of tabling the resolution, acknowledged the commissioners should not rush into making amendments to the charter regarding voting.\nAt a public hearing for the resolution Feb. 25, residents shared thoughts on who should and shouldn't be considered eligible to vote in town elections. The discussion, which opened the doors to potential additional charter amendments, led commissioners to hold a work session March 5.\nGreer said the work session brought a lot of input, and she said there were still a lot of questions.\n\"I do not want to pass this in a rush tonight,\" she said Tuesday.\nCostigan, the only commissioner to vote against tabling the resolution, said he felt the resolution addressed a \"flaw\" in the charter's verbiage.\n\"All that it did was recognize that the Talbot County system was the most logical way to assure that people are eligible and can vote,\" he said, adding that the concerns around who is eligible to vote would need to be addressed in another section of the charter.\nAfter the resolution was tabled, Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan suggested the commissioners write rules for the Oxford Election Board regarding registration, absentee ballots and poll watching.\n\"The last election we had a livestream for individuals to watch,\" she said. \"If you're going to follow that process again, we should have something established.\"\nGreer said they should hold a work session on the matter, and Bell agreed that a work session should be scheduled. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rabbi Hyman delivers multicultural understanding\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Easton has been and is blessed with an extraordinarily number of exceptionally talented individuals engaged in a wide range of community service endeavors.One of them is Rabbi Peter Hyman DD (Doctor of Divinity) who is retiring in October after serving 18 years as the first full-time rabbi at Easton's Temple B'nai Israel.\nRabbi Hyman has a long history in walking his talk on promoting greater understanding of and respect for individuals with different religious beliefs and different faith journeys.\nThere is no more enduring symbol of Rabbi Hyman's commitment to respect for other religious beliefs than a Persian rug he bought in Israel 40 years ago. It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said, 'Is that my vehicle on fire?'\" said Anthony Wilson, a member of the lodge, who stood across the street as firefighters extinguished dwindling embers. (Some members) ran around here and saw the smoke and said there was a fire Then all of us came out and came over here.\" \"(There were) no injuries. Nothing but the dog. Everybody else was gone, except for the guy upstairs. We kicked the door pretty hard, and he finally came out, luckily. Everyone else was out after that, and it was just a matter of time waiting for the fire company.\"Dispatchers alerted local fire departments about the blaze at 5:46 p.m. About 60 first responders reported to the scene, according to emergency officials at the scene.An official from the St. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department, who was on the scene, confirmed that there were no injuries reported in the incident and that the fire was contained to a single structure, located at 21 South West St. in Easton.Due to the structure's age, he said, safeguards had not been included in its construction, making the duplex susceptible to the quick-spreading fire.Neighbors who gathered at the scene reported that the duplex, which consists of an upstairs and a downstairs unit, had been engulfed in flames at one point in the evening, with fire visible from both upstairs and downstairs windows.Firefighters on the scene included the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, the Oxford Fire Company, the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, the St. Michaels Fire Department and the Cordova Volunteer Fire Company. EMS and law enforcement personnel were on site to assist.As firefighters began to extinguish the last remaining flames shortly before 7 p.m., a fire marshal arrived to begin conducting an investigation into the fire's cause. Findings from this investigation will be released at a later date.A GoFundMe has been established to benefit a resident of one of the two affected units. More details can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/7u4cy-my-grandma.Star Democrat reporter Natalie Jones contributed to this report. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF MIKE DETMER\n \nFirefighters from the Easton Volunteer Fire Department responded to a working house fire at 21 S West Street, which broke out shortly after 5:30 p.m. Wednesday evening. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They collaborate with coworkers and supervisors, plan and prepare thoroughly, listen thoughtfully to students, staff, parents and the community, stay organized and manage responsibilities skillfully.

The president of the xouncil sets the agenda and runs the meetings to keep the town moving forward. The president of the Town Council also sets the tone for how important citizen input is welcomed and addressed.\nThe role requires diplomacy, patience and integrity — all qualities Don Abbatiello possesses.\nDon has an impressive resume. His 27 years as an educator, 6-year history on the Easton Town Council, and 16 years of service to the Easton Volunteer Fire Company make him uniquely qualified for this position. His deep commitment to our community is evident in everything he does.\nI wholeheartedly endorse Don Abbatielllo for the very important position of the president of the Town of Easton. I will vote on May 6 at the Easton firehouse as I look forward to Easton's positive future.\nPEGGY FORD\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lions extend title stretk to four\n\n May 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: News \n \n 860\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BERLIN — Queen Anne's County High's girls lacrosse team doesn't have much use for the word pressure.Instead, the themes that are constant companions for the Lions are, expectations and standards.\n\"They're always the expectations at QA,\" Lions head coach Kesley Fitzgerald said. \"And I put it on our girls, and on myself and coaching staff, to do whatever we can to get us the success that we've gotten in the past, and make sure it keeps flowing into the future.\"\nQueen Anne's kept its rule over the Bayside Conference flowing Monday night, as senior RJ Ensor scored six goals and set up another, pacing the Lions to a fourth consecutive conference championship with an 11-8 victory over host Stephen Decatur.\n\"I think it's a big honor to hold, and I think it's an expectation for our program,\" said junior midfielder Haley Cole of winning the conference title. \"That's just how we play. It's expected of us. And we all want it. This is just one of the most connected teams I've been on.\"\nWinners of 11 straight, Queen Anne's (12-1) took a lead it maintained from start to finish a little over 4 minutes into play, when Cole set up Charlotte Schmidt's initial goal. Ensor made it 2-0 with a free-position strike 2:27 later.\nBut the Seahawks (7-6) weren't ready for a repeat of the April 16 meeting between the two teams, when Queen Anne's earned a 16-6 victory in Centreville.\nLaila Pascucci (two goals, assist) converted Lo Malinowski's feed to put Decatur on the board with 4:23 left in the opening quarter. Cole answered, snapping a shot from right wing past Seahawks goalie Layla Hamrock (six saves). Pascucci again responded for the Seahawks with 18 seconds left in the first, pulling Decatur within 3-2.\n\"We knew coming down here it would be more hype for them,\" Fitzgerald said of Decatur. \"The (Decatur) boys just won (13-11 over Kent Island in the boys championship) a big game. You get propelled by that. We knew they were a good program and would make adjustments. And we made adjustments too.\"\nBut the Lions took control with a 7-2 surge that started with Ensor setting up Riley Klepper's goal 52 seconds into the second period, and finished with Ensor's sixth goal with 1:24 left in the third period, pushing Queen Anne's to a 10-4 lead.\n\"Every team wants a lead,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I think we're comfortable with a good strong lead. I would like to have seen us obviously put a few more in, get some more padding, but play a little bit more patient ball. And know when you have the lead in a game of momentum with high emotion that you have to be a little smart with your clock management, even when you're in the second quarter and third quarter.\"\nHelping the Lions establish that solid lead were Bea Holthaus' efforts on the draw, and Cole's all-around play at the midfield.\n\"Starting with that draw, the possessions are what helped us\" Fitzgerald said. \"I'm sure Decatur is probably not happy with some of the turnovers that they had. And we really didn't execute off many of their turnovers. But we did get the possessions and I think that probably helped a little bit to feel like we still had control of the game.\"\nGoals from Ensor, Kaitlyn Horney and Kaisa Hickson helped the Lions build a 7-4 halftime lead. That lead ballooned to 10-4 in the third quarter, as Ensor scored three straight goals — two off assists from Schmidt and Hickson.\nBut late in the third quarter, Queen Anne's drew a 2-minute, non-releasable yellow card and Decatur capitalized. MB Morse (two goals) and Jill Burton (two goals) each scored once in the final 30 seconds of the third, pulling Decatur within 10-6. Morse scored off Pascucci's pass to make it a three-goal difference 1:08 into the fourth.\nQueen Anne's killed off the remaining 19 seconds of the penalty. Then with 5:52 remaining, Ensor wheeled from behind the net, made quick stop, pivoted and squeezed a shot between Hamrock and the right post for an 11-7 lead.\n\"You score that goal and your opponent's looking up at the clock going, 'We got to go, we got to go,'\" Fitzgerald said. \"That's huge.\"\nHamrock denied Ensor with 4:20 left and the Seahawks transitioned quickly downfield, where Mara Mills fired a shot past Lions goalie Emma Dulin (six saves) with 4:01 remaining.\nQueen Anne's won the ensuing draw. Fitzgerald called time with 3:15 remaining, then watched her team pass and run the ball around to burn clock. Fitzgerald called another timeout with 18 seconds left, and again watched her team play keep away to seal the title.\n\"Our seniors have never lost a Bayside championship,\" Fitzgerald said. \"That means a lot to our program and I think it's something they should be really, really proud of. I think that's really hard in this women's lacrosse atmosphere around here, where we've got good, strong competition. And it's only getting better. So that means we have to keep putting expectations and the standards high.\"\nNotes: It's the third time in Bayside history a team has won four straight titles, with Queen Anne's doing it twice (2022-25, and 2011-2014) and Decatur once (2006-09). \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Seminar Focuses On Trends In Pancreatic Cancer Care\n\n November 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Contributed | Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 698\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEAVITT - Pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare cancer, representing only 3% of estimated new cancer diagnoses each year.However, it is especially lethal. Presently the third leading cause of cancer death, pancreatic cancer kills more than 50,000 Americans every year.For the Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation Inc., supporting efforts to advance the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and educating the public about risk factors and symptoms of the disease are key strategies for saving lives.On this year's World Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Day Nov. 16, the Foundation sponsored a seminar, \"New Trends in Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment,\" in the Cadby Theatre at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills.Designed for clinicians involved in patient care, the evening program featured presentations by three leading University of Maryland Medical System oncology specialists: Nader Hanna, a professor of surgery at UM School of Medicine and director of clinical operations for the Division of General and Oncologic Surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC); Yixing Jiang, a professor of medicine at UM SOM and director of GI medical oncology at the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center at UMMC; and Jason K. Molitoris, an associate professor of radiation oncology at UM SOM, associate medical director at the Department of Radiation Oncology at UMMC, and director of Clinical Hyperthermia Program.Hanna provided an overview of various risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including heredity (indicating a family history of certain genetic mutations) and smoking, and noted that symptoms of the disease, such as weight loss, back pain, jaundice and adult-onset (over age 65) diabetes, most often don't present until the disease is relatively advanced.He also reviewed various diagnostic strategies and surgical approaches, stressing the importance of surgical resection as the most significant factor for survival.Jiang discussed the genetic aspects of pancreatic cancer and how chemotherapy drugs are tailored to address the specific mutations identified in individual patients.She noted that systemic chemotherapy provides curative results for less than 30 percent of patients and that side effects can be very severe. However, in many cases it does improve survival time and also palliates cancer-related symptoms.Molitoris described the role of radiation in treating pancreatic cancer, including challenges caused by the location of the pancreas near other tissues that can be damaged by radiation.He described the criteria for cases in which radiation is employed prior to surgery to shrink tumor size, or after surgery to palliate complications from the disease and improve quality of life.\"We were really pleased to have a good turnout for this event, and the presenters provided very clear and detailed updates from the standpoint of their practice,\" said Bill Shrieves, president of the Mid-Shore Pancreatic Foundation Inc.\"The Foundation does a lot to support pancreatic cancer patients and to raise funds for research on the disease, but as one of our volunteers commented, this event might be the most important thing we've done as an organization.If just one of the clinicians who attended does something different based on the information that was shared and it improves the outcome for a pancreatic cancer patient, that is the best kind of success,\" he said.Shrieves also credited support from Tidewater Rotary in making the event possible.\"A generous grant of $5,000 from Rotary's Flags for Cancer Program made it possible for us to offer this event free of charge, and we are very grateful for that support,\" he said.Established in 2013, The Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation Inc. sponsors and participates in events that raise awareness about pancreatic cancer in the community, and also helps patients and their families in the Mid-Shore region find assistance, financial support and transportation to and from treatments.The group funds research through direct grants or support for other organizations, such as the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.For more information about The Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation, Inc., visit midshorepancan.org/or call 410-745-9243. \n \n Caption: MID-SHORE PANCREATIC CANCER FOUNDATION\n \nThe Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation, led by Foundation President Bill Shrieves (second from right), recently hosted University of Maryland Medical System physicians Dr. Jason K.

    "content": "Talbot council mulling $1.1 million request from school district\n\n May 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 706\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With less than two weeks until the Talbot County Council adopts its budget ordinance for next fiscal year, education funding hangs in the balance.Talbot County Public Schools is seeking $1.1 million in additional funds for fiscal year 2026 — $600,000 to fill nine new positions and $500,000 for teacher and staff salary increases. The former would add to the district's multilingual and special education staff, while the latter aims to inch the district closer to state-mandated $60,000 teacher salary minimums by fiscal year 2027.\nDistrict leaders say it's a \"scaled-back\" request from its $5.7 million ask of the county earlier this budget cycle.\n\"We recognize the financial pressures you face,\" Board of Education President Emily Jackson said at a May 6 budget hearing. \"This ask is lean, deliberate and rooted in what's most necessary to keep moving forward.\"\nIn the county's budget already is $55 million for TCPS as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's overarching education improvement framework.\nCouncil members are left to mull the best option as they prepare to vote on final amendments to the county's draft $161 million budget. So far, there's no clear decision.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher supported fulfilling the district's full $5.7 million request last month and maintained that stance for the pared down ask at a budget deliberation Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have to do it sooner or later,\" Lesher said. \"I think it makes sense to do it this year and reduce the pain next year.\"\nPresident Chuck Callahan said he feels comfortable with honoring the $600,000 part of the request to cover the new positions.\nCouncil members Keasha Haythe, Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp have all indicated they need more time to consider options.\nAny additional funding granted would result in an education supplement to the property tax rate, which is 79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nTalbot County is already mandated by the state to pay $440,000 for teachers' pensions, which will be collected through a supplement of less than half a cent per $100 of assessed value.\nThree potential scenarios for tax supplements have been laid out by county staff:\nTeachers' pensions only: 0.0045 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $500,000 for salary increases: 0.0096 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $600,000 for new positions: 0.0106 per $100 of assessed value.\nHaythe said Tuesday she's trying to balance helping the school system with preventing tax increases for residents on fixed income, such as seniors.\n\"I am in no way, shape or form trying to discount the great work that the school system does and what the teachers do in the classroom,\" Haythe said.\nAt last week's hearing, teachers and parents advocated for the council to include the $1.1 million. Lisa Hayes, a parent of three TCPS graduates, said past education investments are paying off now as her children enter the workforce.\n\"You cannot not fund a budget for our children's education because there is nothing more important than that,\" Hayes said.\nAndy Burke, president of the Talbot County Education Association, which functions as the teachers' union, made his case.\n\"We continue to see too many educators migrate away to the higher wages and salaries paid in neighboring public school systems,\" Burke said.\nIn an emailed statement, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district made \"very difficult choices\" to reduce its request to the county.\nJones noted staff will present the Board of Education with a budget amendment package in June, which will adjust the $86 million unrestricted budget the board OK'd in February.\n\"We will eliminate most of the new positions we had requested,\" Jones wrote. \"We will scale back our requests and defer programs that will have the least direct impact on our goals for our students.\"\nA final decision by the county on the $1.1 million in question, as well as the entire FY26 budget, is expected at the council's May 27 meeting.\nWhile no clear choice was made during Tuesday's deliberations, county and district leaders did agree that state mandates and formulas are creating the tricky fiscal situation.\n\"It's just become screamingly clear that there's a disconnect at the state level between the requirements that they're putting on local schools across the state, and the funding formulas that are articulated to county governments to pay for their education,\" said County Manager Clay Stamp. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man sentenced for child abuse, assault\n\n February 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 387\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A Cambridge man has been sentenced to incarceration after being found guilty of charges that stem from an incident with his infant in April 2023.On Feb. 21, Marcus Peak, 28, was sentenced to 28 years of incarceration, with all but 15 of those years suspended, in the Dorchester County Circuit Court. Peak was also sentenced to serve five years of probation with the condition that he not have any unsupervised contact with minors.\nIn December, Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge William Jones found Peak guilty of of first- and second-degree assault, first- and second-degree child abuse, neglect of a minor and reckless endangerment.\nThe charges against Peak stem from an incident on April 21, 2023, when Cambridge Police officers responded to assist Dorchester County Emergency Medical Services with an infant who was unconscious and not breathing. EMS treated the infant and transported her to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. The baby was then transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\nAccording to police, Peak told detectives he had just fed his daughter a bottle and placed her in a bassinet for a nap. He said the baby was asleep.\nPeak said that when he returned to check on her later, he noticed the baby's head was tilted to the side with fluid coming from her nose and mouth. He said the baby's eyes were partially opened.\nAt that time, Peak denied any traumatic event that could have caused injury to his daughter.\nDetectives were told Peak had lied and did not inform them the baby had fallen to the floor, striking her head. Peak allegedly then picked the baby up and shook her to wake her up, according to a report from the Cambridge Police Department.\nDuring the trial in December, Dr. Eric Klotz, an emergency medicine physician who treated the child that day, said the child's injuries were consistent with a high mechanism of injury. He said it was one of the more severe head injuries he's seen in his career.\nDr. Joseph Scheller, a pediatric neurologist who was asked by Peak's defense to testify, said it is possible the child's injuries were caused by an accidental fall. He said short falls can sometimes cause serious injury.\nAccording to Maryland court documents, Dorchester County Assistant Public Defender Michelle Moodispaw filed a notice to appeal the case on Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bennett High girls head soccer coach Ed O'Leary knew the final of the regular-season match was deceiving.\"When we beat them three-nil in Queen Anne's, we knew it wasn't a three-nil game,\" O'Leary said of the Clippers' Sept. 30 game with Queen Anne's County.\nMonday's rematch was much different, but still the Clippers came out on the winning end, as freshman Gracie Core's goal with 3 minutes, 8 seconds remaining lifted Bennett to its third consecutive Bayside Conference championship via a 3-2 victory over the Lions at Snow Hill High's Kelly Shumate Stadium.\n\"We expected that from Mike (Kern) and Jeff (Anthony),\" O'Leary said of Queen Anne's head coach and assistant. \"First minute they just were on top, and they were so aggressive. And we like that. And they made us fight for everything. You know what? That's the way it should be.\"\nThe first half ended with Bennett (13-0) in a place it had never been all year — trailing.\nWith not quite 2 minutes remaining, Queen Anne's Shannon Rath drove a direct kick that Clippers keeper Sophia Valenzano (six saves) dove to her left to make an initial save on. But the ball trickled to the right of Valenzano who was still on the ground when the Lions' Kara Ringold rushed in to knock in the game's first goal.\n\"We came out and we ended up getting that first goal in the first half,\" Kern said. \"It's what we needed. It was very important because we've struggled scoring against the good teams this year. We've scored a lot of goals for the season, but (in) these big games we're having a tough time putting the ball in the back of the net. So getting that first goal was huge.\"\nQueen Anne's goalie Bea Holthaus (seven saves) kept the Lions (9-3-1) in front early in the second half when she came out to intercept a corner kick headed near her goal line. But less than 3 minutes later, Holthaus made a sliding stop on Core, who quickly possessed the rebound and dished a short pass to Rilynn East for the tying goal.\nHolthaus and Valenzano each made saves on corner kick 3 minutes apart.\nBennett transitioned downfield. Core came down the right side, was bumped by Queen Anne's Hayden Legg, managed to stay on her feet, and steered a shot past Holthaus into the left side for a 2-1 Bennett lead with 20:41 remaining in the game.\n\"Bennett's a strong team and we defended them well for most of the game,\" said Kern of a Clippers team that had outscored the opposition 82-3 this season.\nQueen Anne's wasn't quite through though.\nWith 11:10 left, Madison Horney carried into the box, stumbled slightly through a tackle by Bennett's Taylor Matthews, then while falling, managed to get enough of her right foot on the ball to get it past Valenzano for a 2-2 tie. It was the first time Bennett had allowed two goals in game all season.\n\"We came back, hung tough,\" Kern said.\nQueen Anne's came within inches of taking a lead when it banged shot off a corner went off the crossbar with 6:22 remaining.\nThe game appeared headed for overtime. But with the clock approaching the 3-minute mark, Core collected a ball that glanced off a defender, and from right wing, drove a left-footed shot into the left side of the net for the winning goal.\n\"I hope the crowd enjoyed it because it was a wonderful game,\" O'Leary said. \"We got a little bit lucky in the end. They could have scored but the crossbar. But our super freshman (Core) went and scored a cracking goal at the end.\"\nIt was the Lions third straight loss to the Clippers in the championship game, yet Kern — who told his team afterwards \"This was better than any practice we could have had,\" came away encouraged.\n\"Hit the crossbar on a corner kick and we had bad clear in the back and they capitalized on it,\" Kern said. \"Proud of the girls. Proud how they played. The effort was there. And I think we can build from it moving into the playoffs.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Some people have a fear of numbers like 13 and 666. What in the wor l ddoes anumberhavetodowith anything?Not being superstitious, there are times I am slightly confused about life. Something happens that I don't feel I'm in charge of.For example, the other morning, the gracious mistresslof the parsonage entered the living room, where I was sitting on myl easy chair drinking coffee. With alhuge smile, she said, \"I got you an apple fritter for this morning.\" And she gave it to me, smiled at me and then walked away.The following day, I got up and got my coffee, went out to my easy chair in the living room, and started to sip it very carefully.As I was getting situated, the gracious mistress of the parsonage walked in, and I saw in her hand another apple fritter.Again, I got up the following day, went and got my coffee, and sat in my easy chair. In a few mo me nts, in walks lthe grfccio Bs mistress of the parsonage, and in her hand is another apple fritter.\"Here's an apple fritter for you this morning. I think you'll enjoy it today.\" She smiled at me, turned around, and returned to the kitc hen.It's not that I can't handle an apple fritter because I can. It's the fact that someone is bringing these apple fritters to me who does not like apple fritters. Something is happening behind the scenes, and I'm anxious to find o ut.The next day, the same thing happened. Now I'm getting to be suspicious. What in the world am I missing here?Not wanting to sabotage my good luck the last four days, I kept silent and enjoyed the fritter. Whatever is behind this, I may never know, but I w ill enjoy it for whatever it is worth.I couldn't help thinking of a Bible verse, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not\" (Galatians 6:9).Sometimes, the best thing to do is NOTHING and let God have it.Dr. James L.

They don't care, and they're always in a hurry.\"\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, the intersection has seen three crashes this month, all due to driver error. There were only 13 in the last 11 years, police said.\nTown engineers reviewed the traffic light, which was confirmed as operational. In a Facebook post, the police department encouraged drivers to be cautious and stated the intersection will be monitored.\n\"While this location is being monitored, officers have begun targeted traffic enforcement and will continue to do so at different hours of the day,\" the department wrote.\nPinkney said she's worried for the safety of her 9-year-old daughter and her dog when walking up and down Aurora Street near the intersection. She says a car has careened into her yard before, and many neighbors have had their parked cars damaged.\nPinkney believes part of the issue is drivers may be unaware it is a residential area.\n\"The speed limit's 25, and I know people are going more than 25,\" she said. \"Our kids play out here. And what worries me about everything is if … someone's not paying attention or whatnot, them running the red light or just going way too fast and clipping me and my daughter.\"\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said the town is looking at what it can do with the intersection's traffic light in terms of safety and timing.\nEaston's engineers recently adjusted the timing of the intersection's traffic light, hoping to lower the \"chances of a collision if a driver attempts to beat a red light,\" the Easton Police Department announced Tuesday.\nDiscussion around safety on Brookletts Avenue has been recurring. This month, the town installed four-way stop signs at two other Brookletts intersections, South Harrison Street and Hanson Street. The intersections previously had two stop signs each.\nVan Emburgh said thus far, feedback on the four-way stop signs has been positive. Resident Lisa Stone lives next to the intersections and said she's happy with the change.\n\"I have seen so many near accidents at the intersections, particularly Hanson and Brookletts,\" Stone said. \" … I think that's a good improvement.\"\nThe town also added on-street parking lines to Brookletts Avenue, a measure that Van Emburgh said will improve safety on the wide, two-way street.\n\"The white lines give the drivers cues as to where they're supposed to be in the travel lanes,\" Van Emburgh said. \"Because one of the things that we struggle with is when you have a road that can accommodate on-street parking, but no one's actually parking on it, it looks like a wide-open raceway.\"\nFor many neighbors, traffic and safety concerns only grow as developers revamp a nearby property formerly owned by Perdue AgriBusiness. Last week, Easton's Planning Commission approved the majority of a 123-unit proposal for the site along Brookletts Avenue.\nDevelopers had Lenhart Traffic Consulting prepare a traffic impact study, which recommended project approval. Per Planning Commission documents, the study found redevelopment will have \"minimal impact on the surrounding road network.\"\nRuffini said with the new development and an eventual increase in traffic, South Aurora Street \"will be a main road before you know it.\"\nStone, meanwhile, is excited to see the redevelopment, given it includes commercial space and affordable housing. But she's keeping an eye on its impacts to driver and pedestrian safety.\n\"Hopefully it will just be an increase in traffic and not a decrease in safety,\" Stone said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans.

Second St. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nThe Star Democrat spoke to both candidates ahead of the election. Their answers to the paper's questions can be found below.\nWHAT IS YOUR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE?Perez: \"Here on the Shore, I served as community outreach/Main Street coordinator for the Town of Greensboro. I presented best practices at statewide Maryland Municipal League Conference in my talk titled, 'Partnering for Progress: Municipalities and Community Organizations Working Together,' where elected officials and municipal staff learned about developing partnerships between municipalities and community organizations is critical to providing quality services to a shared constituency. In addition to this Maryland political experience, I also bring fresh ideas from serving as district assistant for a city council in Massachusetts. We created a communication bridge between residents and the City Council and community programs.\"\nPerez went on to list leadership positions he has held with 19 boards and organizations on the Eastern Shore in the past 10 years.\nBranson: \"I have been mayor five times and on the board for 38 years. So I know everything you want to know.\"\nWHAT MAKES YOU THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR THE POSITION?Branson: \"The biggest thing is I have been doing this for 38 years and I know the ins and outs of everything.\"\nPerez: \"Over the past 10 years I have dedicated myself to working tirelessly to be part of the solution. I come to run as a candidate to bring people together, connecting with our community and impacting it in a positive way, especially through the creation of different local programs for youth and families. Having the ability to make decisions based on knowledge and data not assumptions, making decisions that benefit everyone in our town. Direct contact with all the different kinds of residents in Denton and knowledge of the situations that our community has, especially our elderly, youth and small business owners. Being able to bring new ideas and perspectives and new ways to help our town grow.\"\nWHY ARE YOU RUNNING?Branson: \"I am running because there is a lot of things I'd like to get done. And the five of us, right now, for the last few years, we work so sweetly together, and there is no rift or anything like that. We really get things done for the town of Denton and the citizens of Denton. I am hoping to keep that going.\"\nPerez: \"My home, the Town of Denton, has always had a special place in my heart, and I can serve better our community as part of the Town Council. I want to continue to work for my community in a respectful and equitable manner and help our town move towards the future with strong economic growth while maintaining our small town charm.\"\nWHAT CHANGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?Perez: \"I will actively listen to small business owners to develop solutions together. Also, I will provide support and assistance to the downtown Main Street office to combine efforts to protect and preserve our local businesses. We should keep property taxes low and water costs affordable for all... Our town is full of history and art. The Town Council can create collaborations with organizations that showcase art and history in our town is essential to expand, promote, and highlight the arts and history district in our town by providing them with the necessary support. Thus, making our town, art and history enjoyed by visitors and citizens... For the past 10 years, my work has been focused on seeking the well-being and impacting our youth in a positive way through different programs and community services. As a council member, I will seek to create collaborations and build bridges of communication with different organizations to create, promote and expand programs that help our young people reach their full potential.\"\nBranson: \"See the change from the social service building. I really want to see the road to nowhere from Walmart over to 404 is going to be called Commerce Drive. It has gone from $1 million to $3 million to build the road. I really want us to cut taxes again this year. I hope there is a way to get this road money to help with the taxes and not have to double tax the people in town. I am looking for any way that we can make it better for affordable housing for people in Denton... Another big thing is that we are looking with the county, they are going to have to build another middle school. There is a possibility that where Caroline County High School is that there is land to do that out there. In the future, are they going to keep the middle school there or put it somewhere else in Denton or are they going to go out to North Caroline and put it there? ... Another thing is to build water and sewer out in west Denton. There are a lot of houses where their septic systems are going out.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "\"Hair\" is still worth getting into\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 16 | Section: News \n \n 352\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The recent passing of Treat Williams makes a viewing of \"Hair\" bittersweet now, but director Milos Forman's 1979 screen version of the hit stage musical is very much worth seeing for the amazing energy that the Vietnam War-era project retains in the transition from live theater to film with Williams' memorable performance no small part of that.MGM+ presents the movie Thursday, Aug. 24.The actor plays Berger, the leader of a band of New York hippies - and a very strong influence on a military draftee (John Savage) who begins to second-guess his plans for a relatively conservative future after being exposed to the very free lifestyle of his new acquaintances. Beverly D'Angelo, Annie Golden and Melba Moore also are in the cast of the picture, which boasts songs that became iconic - including the title tune, \"Aquarius,\" \"Let the Sunshine In\" and \"Good Morning Starshine.\" A particular showstopper is Williams' rendering of \"I Got Life.\" \n \n Caption: Treat Williams in \"Hair\" \n \n Memo: more retro rewinds\n \n\"The Idolmaker\" (Paramount+ With Showtime, streaming): Director Taylor Hackford's fabulous 1980 drama-with-music is informed by great original tunes and the excellent acting of Ray Sharkey as a would-be songwriter who becomes a self-styled late-1950s talent manager, transforming a naive restaurant worker (Peter Gallagher, also superb, in his movie debut) into a teen idol named Caesare. With success comes strife, though, as the new star becomes overwhelmed by sudden fame. Tovah Feldshuh, Joe Pantoliano and Maureen McCormick (yes, TV's Marcia Brady) also appear.\n \n\"The Monkees\" (Catchy Comedy, Sunday, Aug. 20): Though the musical quartet was formed for purposes of this comedy series, the foursome also had some genuine hit records (\"Daydream Believer,\" the Neil Diamond-composed \"I'm a Believer,\" etc.) - virtually all of which are heard here as a weekend marathon of the show continues.\n \n\"Ironside\" (GetTV, Wednesday, Aug. 23): After his long run as \"Perry Mason,\" Raymond Burr began another sizable weekly-TV stay in the two-hour pilot film for the series that cast him as San Francisco's chief of detectives, who becomes a special operative after being paralyzed below the waist by a sniper he is determined to track down. Don Galloway, Barbara Anderson and Don Mitchell also are series regulars. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The council approved sending the dispensary requirement proposal back to the planning commission to revise and reword the intention.\nThe council noted through communication with the Town of Centreville and discussion with the Queen Anne's Sheriff's Office, since May 2022, the retail cannabis locations in Centreville have not had any notable crime or problems related to cannabis.\nIn other business, noting rising food costs, during public comment resident Paris Wells expressed interest in changing the town's ordinance to allow for chickens.\nWells noted the benefit of raising chickens as food in the garage and suggested allowances to the town's current ordinance forbidding feathered fowl.\nThe town's current ordinance against chickens has been in place for decades, but if a petition with 50 percent of residents' support came forward, the council may consider amendments, Commissioner President Alton Hardee said.\nThe Queenstown Town Commissioners will next meet March 27 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The museum is a loving tribute to the late JOK Walsh, president of the Caroline County Historical Society, whose vision helped define the museum.\nThe Museum of Rural Life offers visitors a rare glimpse into life on the rural Eastern Shore through historic dwellings, which have been preserved and converted into museum space by the historical society.\nAmong the preserved structures is the Annie Taylor, or Taylor-Brown, House, which was built for merchant-broker Solomon Brown in 1819 and later owned by the Taylors, an African American family.\n\"JOK Walsh's vision for the Annie Taylor House was to show the assets of our county, to instill pride in the Village Green where homes like Annie Taylor, one of the two oldest homes in Denton, was built and renovated,\" said Cathy Schwab, president of the Ridgely Historical Society.\n\"How wonderful to be able to walk the Village Green, to stop in a business located in a renovated home, have candlelight walks at Christmas and to promote tourism and economic development,\" she continued.\nAnd the historical society has plans to convert other structures into educational spaces as well.\nCurrent president Charles Andrew said that the repurposing of the old Denton Volunteer Fire House, which was first built in 1927, as a Heritage Center will allow the structure to become the County's hub to direct visitors to tour Federalsburg, Greensboro, Preston and Ridgely museums; Milling at Linchester Mill; the Underground Railroad story at the historical society's restored JOK Webb log cabin and Wm Still cottage; and the Ridgely Train Station.\nAt the Museum of Rural Life, exhibits feature personal details of those who have called Caroline County home over several centuries, from models of steamboats that used to traverse local rivers to the wedding dress of JOK Walsh's mother Mary Ann Walsh.\nHistorical Society Vice President Rick Schwab said, \"history in Caroline County is always spoken here, making the community aware of its beginnings.\"\nThe Rural Life Museum is open Saturdays from March through November from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\"We encourage you to visit the wealth of information and the grandeur of presentation,\" said Historical Society Treasurer Carolyn Spicher.\nFor more information, call 410-479-2055 or visit Carolinehistory.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average price of diesel has declined 1.8 cents in the last week and stands at $3.472 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.63 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.16 per gallon.\nThe falling prices may be coming to an end.\n\"As we edge closer to the end of the year, we're seeing momentum for falling gas prices weaken, which is typical as the national average generally bottoms out between Thanksgiving and Christmas,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With oil prices rising back above $70 last week, gas prices may have less potential to drop much further, though there may be a second window of lower prices in January or February in some areas, but even that won't last long.\"\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 0.8 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $2.98 per gallon today. The national average is down 7.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 7.1 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nDec. 16, 2023: $3.10 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.05 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2022: $3.18 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.13 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2021: $3.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.32 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2020: $2.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.20 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2019: $2.45 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2018: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.36 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2017: $2.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.43 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2016: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.23 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2015: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.01 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2014: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.51 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.84 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from last week's $2.90 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.15 per gallon, down 0.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.00 per gallon, down 6.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.06 per gallon.\n\"While several states saw gas prices cycle last week, marked by a big jump in prices after a large decline, those that did see hefty jumps should see prices drift a bit lower, potentially making a second run at the season's lowest prices,\" De Haan said. \"The West Coast, including California, should continue to see prices drift lower, but with just a few weeks left in 2024, all attention turns to 2025. GasBuddy's 2025 Fuel Outlook, among the nation's most accurate fuel price forecasts, will be released in the coming weeks, offering motorists a glimpse into gas prices for the coming year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Towns need to balance pride in past with future\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRANDON WRIGHT | Section: Columns \n \n 805\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, I listened to a webinar about the challenges of planning, land use and economic development in rural areas. Communities frequently struggle to grow and still maintain their character. Balancing economic growth with the community's heritage is among the most significant challenges for elected officials because the two are often intertwined.An industry of consultants has grown up to help communities meet these challenges. Like the consultants, I believe a balance can be reached.\nMaybe I am too much of an optimist, but I think opposing groups can find common ground if they are honest and transparent. I served as chief of staff in the Maryland Department of Planning nearly 10 years ago. I met with town council members, county commissioners and local business leaders, all vested in making their communities strong and vibrant. My confidence comes from listening to their hopes, dreams and goals for their communities.\nI met with the consultants, too. Everyone wanted the same for the community — the absolute best.\nCompromises that are in the best interests of all the various constituencies and stakeholders can be forged, even in rural Maryland like the Eastern Shore. There is no place like it. Its ecosystems and economies are different, even from other rural parts of the state. So much of the economy is dependent on the Chesapeake Bay and the rivers that feed into it. It is teeming with myriad species of animals on land and sea.\nThe motto of Federalsburg, my hometown in Caroline County, is \"Pride in the Past, Faith in the Future.\" Unfortunately in towns like Federalsburg, more emphasis is placed on the past than the future. Local officials, sometimes pressured by citizens, have these gauzy memories of a better time and place in the community's past and yearn to get back to it.\nHowever, in doing so, they strip decision-makers of any chance at finding the right balance between the past and future, choking off opportunities to attract large employers, employees and all the businesses that spring up to support them both.\nAs a young boy, I fished for bass and perch on the Marshyhope Creek, the northwest fork of the Nanticoke River. I heard the story that the DuPont Company was looking to build its new nylon factory in the area, and the Marshyhope Creek made Federalsburg an attractive site. Unfortunately, DuPont built its nylon plant on the Nanticoke River in Seaford, Delaware, less than 10 miles from Federalsburg. The plant was constructed outside the town, and Seaford quickly became a company town. The contrast between the two towns is dramatic.\nFederalsburg missed out again, this time on AquaCon. An international salmon farming operation would have brought several hundred well-paying jobs, jobs with health care and all the other benefits that help smooth the rough edges of life. AquaCon would have increased revenue to the town, support for existing small businesses and all the different services that make a small town tick.\nTown officials, under pressure from citizens, said no to this opportunity. Rather than work with the company to better understand the project and address concerns, the town leaders said no and now another community will benefit from these jobs and the economic development that comes with it.\nAccording to state data, Caroline County is among the most economically depressed counties in Maryland. We can't lay all the blame at the feet of elected leaders for that. I know many of them, and each one cares deeply for the communities they serve; otherwise, they wouldn't do it. The blame, however, should be shared with the voters that elected them and the voters who pushed the elected leaders to say no to investments in the towns that would spur economic growth over fears of the unknown and fears of something different, a break from the past.\nBecause the citizens share the blame, they are responsible for turning their communities around.\nOur rural communities are blessed with resources that other towns and cities envy. We have kind, friendly people who care for each other. We have the greatest renewable resource of all — an unending stream of smart and talented young men and women graduating from our high schools and colleges, prepared to make the world a better place. Let's do everything we can to keep them here.\nLet our legacy be that we found that balance that everyone strives for and leave the next generation and the generations that follow a community poised for growth, good jobs and continued access to outstanding education. Let's be sure we live up to the motto, \"Pride in the Past, Faith in the Future.\"\nBrandon Wright grew up in Federalsburg and graduated from Colonel Richardson High School in 1997 and Salisbury University in 2001. He was the chief of staff at the Maryland Department of Planning from 2015 to 2017. He now lives in Annapolis, but his family still resides just outside of Federalsburg. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In June, it announced that the FEMA had awarded the city $1.7 million for the first phase of the project.\nThe city said FEMA is also reserving $16 million for the second phase of the project. The total $17.7 million in grant money is being awarded through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant.\nDuring the meeting, representatives from the city, the state, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science at Horn Point, and BayLand Consultants and Designers spoke about climate change, flooding and the project itself.\nMaryland Secretary of Emergency Management Russell Strickland talked about the importance of mitigating disasters prior to them occurring. He said mitigation cuts down on the need for response and on the costs associated with recovery.\n\"So this would be what I would call a transformative mitigation project for the city,\" he said. \"And it's important that it be projects like that because that will have a greater result and a greater benefit for more people.\"\nHorn Point Lab professor Ming Li talked about sea level rise across the Chesapeake Bay and increases in flooding. He said working with nature can be better than fighting with it.\n\"So that's why there's a lot of interest in a lot of places all around the world to look at nature-based solutions,\" he said.\nMegan Barniea, a BayLand senior project engineer, said no design decisions have been made yet, but the plan is to build upon those three main project elements of a living shoreline, embankments and stormwater management.\nHorn Point Lab, which is supporting the project, will help to optimize the living shoreline design, assess flood risk reduction, monitor living shoreline performance and evaluate ecological co-benefits of the project.\nBarniea said the project partners will be coming back to the public to get feedback on a 30% design plan. The plan, which she expects will be ready to show in early 2025, will include the footprint of proposed features, elevations and dimensions, and a construction cost estimate.\nAfter the presentation, residents asked questions about the project, including how the project will affect private docks and public access to the waterfront.\nWhite said the city and its partners will work with each property owner, and residents will keep access to their docks. He said there will be some public access to the living shoreline.\n\"I mean it can't be everywhere, but there will be access,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was charged with attempted first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, first- and second-degree child abuse, neglect of a minor and reckless endangerment.\nThe state later decided it would not prosecute for the murder charges. Peak was found guilty by Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge William Jones of the other six counts.\nThe charges against Peak stem from an incident on April 21, 2023, when Cambridge Police officers responded to assist Dorchester County Emergency Medical Services with an infant who was unconscious and not breathing. EMS treated the infant and transported her to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. The baby was then transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\nAccording to police, Peak told detectives he had just fed the baby a bottle and placed her in a bassinet for a nap. He said the baby was asleep. He said that when he returned to check on the her later, he noticed the baby's head was tilted to the side with fluid coming from her nose and mouth. He said the baby's eyes were partially opened.\nAt that time, Peak denied any traumatic event that could have caused injury to the baby.\nDetectives were told Peak had lied and did not inform them that the baby had fallen to the floor striking her head. Peak allegedly then picked the baby up and shook the baby to wake it, according to a report from the Cambridge Police Department.\nDuring the trial, Jones heard a variety of testimony, including testimony from doctors and the child's mother.\nThe mother, Paris Keene, testified that she had left the house that day to pick up their older child from daycare. She said Peak had stayed with the their five-week-old. She said that when she came back, Peak told her the infant had choked on her spit up.\nWhen Keene took the baby from Peak, she realized that the baby's eyes were rolling back, and Peak called 911.\nDr. Eric Klotz, an emergency medicine physician who treated the child that day, said her injuries were consistent with a high mechanism of injury. He said it was one of the more severe head injuries he's seen in his career.\nDr. Joseph Scheller, a pediatric neurologist who was asked by Peak's defense to testify, said it is possible the child's injuries were caused by an accidental fall. He said that while it is rare, short falls can sometimes cause serious injury.\n\"I am thankful for the judge's consideration,\" Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard told the Star Democrat. \"He gave a very well thought out explanation citing case law and it was obvious that he took significant time to consider the evidence put forth by the state, including expert testimony and other evidence.\"\nLeonard said that a \"long form\" pre-sentence investigation will be conducted, which may take multiple months. As of Friday afternoon, no sentencing date for Peak was scheduled. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Hundreds of residents came together to experience the various activities put together by organizers, volunteers and sponsors.The five-day celebration included events such as fashion shows, games, bouncy castles and vendors. Many of these events were hosted for young people with an interest in leadership, community service, arts and agriculture.\nThe opening ceremony was held on Thursday evening, kids held flags at the center of the Main Show Ring, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented a citation of recognition to organizers of the fair and John Coleman, officer from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, sang \"God Bless America.\"\nLinda Brown, host of the opening ceremony, said in the past, Talbot County had to share its fair with other counties because of how small the county was. Today, Brown is proud of the work that the community does to make the fair possible.\n\"The big thing about this fair is that our community comes together,\" Brown said. \"(I) couldn't count the volunteers that come and do their piece. It could be shavings in a cow barn so that we can have animals. It could be taking a leaf blower and blowing the leaves out of our pavilion. Everybody just jumps in and works together to put on this amazing fair.\"\nBrown said she is proud of the work done by children and young people across the county, which was on full display at the fair.\nThis included the work of her granddaughter Annette Clougherty, who brought three of her cows for show this year.\nClougherty, 12, said she has deep love for animals and hopes to one day become a veterinarian. Her cows, Reba, Andy and Dolly huddled near a giant fan to cool off from the hot weather.\nClougherty encourages any kid who has an interest in animals to raise the animal of their choice and bring them to a local fair.\n\"Do your research, learn and don't just chase your dreams so you can get the money and be done with it,\" she said. \"Actually get into it because these guys (her cows), I don't ever imagine them going to the market, they're always mine in my heart.\"\nClougherty is proud to announce that she is taking her cows to Queen Anne's Fair, which is a big step for her family.\nIn a different stall, Bailei Caldeira, a young pig farmer, brushed her two pigs before a showing. It is her second year showing her pigs, and she said she is better prepared to make an impression. Caldeira said she has always loved pigs.\nWhen asked what advice she would give to kids who would like to raise pigs, she said working hard is the key to caring for pigs.\n\"Don't be scared, just do it,\" Caldeira said. \"Don't care about anyone else. Just care about your pig and you.\"\nFollowing the animal showing, dozens of kids from all age groups showcased their self-created outfits during the Talbot County 4-H Fashion Show.\nThe 4-H program is a local club teaching kids new skills, such as sewing, photography and more. Each kid had a moment to shine as dozens of parents took photos and cheered for their stylish outfits.\nBrown, a former home economics teacher, said she was so proud of all the work that the young contestant did for this year's show. For her, as host of the fashion show, she is impressed by the 27 outfits being modeled in the show and the work of the volunteers who make the event possible.\n\"It's just a culmination of hundreds of people working together and everybody doing their part in order to come up with this little event,\" Brown said. \"We are not a big state fair. We don't have squeaky rides and all that. We're not big enough, but we have people in the community that just come out and enjoy, socialize, marvel at what the kids are doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a present-day tool that can dramatically accelerate growth,\" Holmes says. \"By breaking down what can often feel like a complex or intimidating subject, we're helping entrepreneurs gain a clear understanding of how AI can drive results for their businesses.\"\nThe AI training series reflects a broader regional commitment to fostering innovation and economic vitality. By combining expertise and resources, the partners are delivering an accessible program that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive for many small and midsized businesses.\nEastern Shore business owners and entrepreneurs are encouraged to register for the free online training sessions. Registration is available at talbotworks.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Watermen oppose striped bass cuts, urge status quo at Chesapeake College forum\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1084\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Eastern Shore watermen packed Chesapeake College on Monday and overwhelmingly opposed draft striped bass rules that would trim total removals by 12 percent in 2026 and could add more closures.The public hearing — organized by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources — drew more than 100 people, including county commissioners, council members and state delegates. By a show of hands, virtually every attendee opposed any change to current rules.\nAt issue is Draft Addendum III, the Fisheries Commission's proposal to support rebuilding the East Coast striped bass stock by 2029. The action seeks to reduce fishery removals by 12 percent beginning in 2026. For the commercial sector, the draft proposes a quota cut; for the recreational sector, it considers season closures and/or size-limit changes.\nIt also contemplates requirements for commercial tagging programs, a coastwide definition of total length for size-limit compliance, and changes to Maryland's recreational baseline season to simplify rules, improve enforcement and better align fishing access with release mortality and stakeholder input.\nThe Commission intends to take final action no later than October, with most measures implemented in 2026.\n\"Tonight is a way for the members on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to hear your concerns,\" said Mike Luisi, an associate director with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Fishing and Boating Services and a member of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. He later added: \"The plan is to get the striped bass healthier so we can [return] to additional quotas in light of having a healthier population. That's the truth. It is to provide for a better stock so we can provide more quota back to the commercial industry and [lighten] restrictions on the recreational industry. For those who say we do not take the watermen's advice, we do a spring spawning stock assessment where watermen take us out on their routine.\"\nEmilie Franke, a fishery management plan coordinator for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, walked the audience through the options, including a potential allowance for catch-and-release during part of the spring — a period that has been closed in recent years to protect spawning fish. That drew a sharp reaction.\n\"Catch-and-release will be on spawning grounds,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"How could you push this through knowing this information?\"\nFranke said striped bass–specific research about catch-and-release effects on spawning — such as impacts on egg production or pre-spawn behavior — is limited. \"The research is inconclusive,\" she said, noting the technical committee is working to incorporate environmental factors into models where appropriate.\nSpeakers repeatedly pressed the agencies on data and modeling. Hardman questioned the federal Marine Recreational Information Program estimates. \"The MRIP data that they use is off by about 40 percent,\" he said. \"Maybe the numbers you are trying to hit are so artificially high we will never get there.\"\nDelmarva Fisheries Association President Rob Newberry cited a Maryland study from the late 1990s to argue release mortality is higher than assumed. \"There's 200 years of data you people have flagrantly not paid attention to,\" he said, urging the state and the Fisheries Commission to complete socioeconomic and pollution analyses before tightening rules. \"Start using good science — it's there.\"\nRobert T. Brown, president of the Maryland Watermen's Association, said the draft's rebuilding target is unrealistic. \"You all are wrong that they put the target so high,\" Brown said. \"You can only go so far until it is out of reach. You can't maintain it. When it comes to it, we've got so many rockfish out there now. The big fish are there, the small fish [are] coming back.\"\nElected officials echoed the industry's frustration. \"Send this back, rework it,\" said State Sen. Johnny Mautz. \"The reality of how this plays out is it is overburdening our local economy. Last year's impact from two fish to one fish was catastrophic.\"\nDorchester County Council member Mike Detmer said the draft has eroded trust. \"I am deeply concerned about the 12 percent cut,\" he said. \"What I hear is a lack of confidence in the board. The watermen are the most concerned to have a robust fishery. We have to protect this magical resource.\"\nWicomico County Council member James Winn urged the agencies to look beyond fishermen for causes. \"Are we the issue?\" he asked. \"Could it be a menhaden fleet up in Virginia catching more than just menhaden? Have you done studies on other industries affecting the fish? Maybe we should be restricting what they're doing — not what we're doing.\"\nTalbot Watermen's Association President Jeff Harrison said stricter rules have hollowed out traditional working communities. \"When I ran charter there were about 40 [charter boats] on Tilghman,\" he said. \"Right now there are three. It's hard to call it a fishing village anymore.\"\nDel. Jay Jacobs called spring catch-and-release \"the wrong direction,\" arguing it contradicts prior steps to protect broodstock. \"It's an unscientific position to take without knowing the damage it's caused,\" he said. \"We're here to maintain a historic livelihood.\"\nSeveral speakers described the proposal as a choice between the status quo and more closures, with some options allowing spring catch-and-release. Many said they prefer no change. \"Why haven't you considered giving us 12 percent back instead of taking?\" asked waterman Dan Dierker. \"Start talking to people who pay the most to fish, who have the most to lose. Stop listening to the wrong people like the CCA (Coastal Conservation Association).\nVeteran Kent County waterman Don Pierce said cumulative quota cuts are pushing families out of the business. \"I've been doing this for 60-plus years,\" he said. \"You come in for one day, trying to run this industry. … Had a 12,000-pound quota when this all started. When you're done with this one, I'll have seven. Take a 50 percent cut in your salary, see how long you sit there.\"\nLuisi said the Maryland baseline season concept grew out of feedback from many quarters — including watermen — and that nothing has been finalized for 2026. \"We heard that it would be in Maryland's best interest to try to drive the economy,\" he said. \"These changes weren't meant to harm anyone. They were meant to try to offset different times of the year.\"\nWhat's next: The Fisheries Commission is scheduled to consider Draft Addendum III later this fall in Annapolis, with final action expected no later than October 2025 and implementation in 2026. Commercial tagging requirements, if adopted, could take longer to roll out. Maryland's DNR said it would carry comments from Monday's forum to the board. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Trump’s return has these conservative Latinos excited\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCKVILLE — Juan Leo Salazar is on a mission to awaken a dormant political power in Maryland — the state's conservative-leaning Latinos.He has compiled a list of 28,000 names he believes he can galvanize for conservative causes. He says his organization of Maryland Latino Republicans has roughly 300 paying members.\nHe and many of his conservative friends had been working and keeping their heads down, he said. Now they're not afraid of sharing their views, he said, despite possible criticism and even retaliation.\n\"Now that Trump is in,\" Salazar said, \"nobody's afraid.\"\nExit poll data on Latino voters had some analysts' heads spinning. Nationwide, 46% of this group voted for Donald Trump in the general election.\nBut that turnout for Trump was not surprising for some Latino Republicans like Salazar. He and others had watched the ways people in their networks were responding to the Biden-Harris administration and saw the writing on the wall.\nSalazar, who came to the area in the late 60s, has many thoughts on how Trump will benefit folks in Maryland.\nTo start, he praised Trump's promise to cut taxes on tips and overtime as a win for the working-class Latino community.\n\"Now with the tips, no tax on tips. That is wonderful,\" he said, \"you should see how the Latino community, Hispanics, are so happy about (that).\"\nHe also thinks the Republican victory can help improve cultural issues conservatives care about at the state level.\nConnected with Latino Republicans across six counties in Maryland through his organization, Salazar has a good sense of how politically transformative the issue of parental input into school curricula is. He believes it unifies many minority immigrant groups in the state. This, he said, could change the state's political map.\n\"If those (other) minority groups can get organized … with chapters in different counties,\" he said, \"I'm sure we can turn this state at least orange.\"\nBut to strengthen the Republican hand in a state overwhelmingly run by Democrats, you need friends.\nAlirio Martinez is one of Salazar's friends in that mission.\nMartinez, 50, lives in Easton with his wife Ann and their six cats. Outside of his entrepreneurial work — the two have an online business — Martinez enjoys connecting with fellow partisans.\nThe two men met this October outside of an early-voting polling precinct in eastern Montgomery County. Martinez was in the area and wanted to see if his buddy was canvassing. Salazar happened to have a table set up there, where he was doing outreach to the Latino community.\nMartinez said there are a number of reasons why he's hopeful that Trump's return to Washington could help Latinos in the state.\n\"I tell people it's about what's going on, they're hurting people's pockets big time,\" Martinez said. \"They're seeing the price of the eggs, the milk … the gas.\"\nMartinez, who went as a Republican delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016, said he can remember the time under Trump when his favorite sandwich cost him $5 and when gas prices were more affordable. Things changed under Biden, he believes. \"Everything,\" he said, \"started going up.\"\nInternational politics also plays a role. The two presidential candidates took different stances on the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Where Trump embraced the so-called \"world's coolest dictator,\" Harris expressed concerns about a decline in the country's democratic institutions.\nMartinez said that many Salvadorans, who comprise the largest foreign-born population in Maryland, were disgruntled with what they perceived as Harris attacking a national hero. He said Bukele has done an amazing job of fighting crime in El Salvador.\nThen, there's the elephant in the room.\nPrior to the elections, immigrant rights groups warned that Trump's return to power would spell devastation for immigrant communities. But both Martinez and Salazar pointed to a greater number of deportations under President Obama than under Trump, in Trump's defense.\n\"When he won in 2016, they were saying the same thing, exactly,\" Martinez said.\nHe also said people should remember that Trump extended Temporary Protected Status to Salvadorans in 2019. Martinez, who perceives Democrats as more lenient towards illegal immigration, believes Harris was worse for immigrants in the state. Trump extended Temporary Protected Status after revoking it in 2018.\n\"There are bad and good people,\" Martinez said.\nHe added that many Latinos in the state support tougher immigration. The vast majority who come to the U.S., he believes, are good and hardworking people. It's the small percentage of undocumented individuals doing bad things in the country, he said, that makes Americans perceive all Latinos as criminals.\nSalazar believes Trump would not undergo mass indiscriminate deportations.\n\"He's not going to do this,\" said Salazar, \"because if that happens, we will be here to say, 'Hey, that's not right.'\"\nBoth men plan on attending Trump's upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20. They both hope to meet the administration and lobby for what they believe is important for Latinos in the state, and they are embracing optimism.\n\"For the Latino community,\" said Salazar, \"there are a lot of good things that are happening.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said they were made aware of the shooting by Brown's mother, who drove to the police department and reported that her son had shot her husband in the face.\nBrown was arrested the Tuesday before at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School for allegedly assaulting the school safety officer, but he was released the same day to the custody of his step-father according to Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"He was one of the people involved in this melee at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School last week,\" Phillips said.\nAccording to the press release from the Cambridge Police Department, a witness, who was sitting in a vehicle on Skinners Court, alleges Brown struck her vehicle before his step-father exited the residence. Brown allegedly brandished a firearm and shot the step-father in the face before fleeing on foot to High Street.\nUpon arriving at the scene, officers found Brown exiting the family's residence, where he was arrested. They also found one spent shell casing, but police did not recover the weapon, the press release said.\nPolice said officers and detectives were flagged down near the Park Lane and Camper Street area, where a man was hunched over and bleeding from his mouth. The 34-year-old man was identified as Brown's step-father.\nHe suffered a gunshot wound to the right cheek, and Dorchester County EMS transported him to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. He was then flown to Shock Trauma by Maryland State Police Aviation. The severity of his injuries has not been disclosed.\nDue to current Maryland Juvenile Reform Laws, Brown was not able to be questioned following the incident, police said. The reason for the crime and the whereabouts of the gun are still unknown, they said.\nBrown has been turned over to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections without bond and is being tried as an adult. He is facing nine charges: attempted murder in the first and second degree, assault in the first and second degree, reckless endangerment, handgun on person, loaded handgun on person, firearm use in a felony violent crime and the possession of a firearm for a minor. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dangerous minds - Israel-Hamas war, Musk comments, police surveillance spark new social media fights\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Holy Land war between Israel and Hamas is birthing increased police and government surveillance of social media, prompting calls for more Americans to report \"hate crimes\" and proposals to require all social media accounts to have public name verifications amid concerns about increases in antisemitism and terrorism threats.There are also pushes to deport some anti-war, pro-Palestinian foreign college students deemed supportive of U.S. designated terror groups and expel and ban Palestinian refugees from entering the country.The efforts are born out of security concerns stemming from U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terror attacks. But they are also sparking concerns about stunting or intimating dissent, privacy and other free speech protections.There is also a new social media battle over Twitter/X owner Elon Musk's support for a social media post that talked about anti-white sentiments among \"Jewish communities.\" A number of major media and technology advertisers, who also compete with social media platforms and some of Musk's technology ventures, have paused advertising on X. That includes Disney (which owns ABC and ESPN), Apple, Paramount Global (which owns CBS and Comedy, IBM, Comcast/NBC Universal (which owns NBC and MSNBC) and Warner Bros/Discovery (which owns CNN).Musk said he agreed with a post from a Twitter who said \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" \"You said the actual truth,\" Musk said in a reply Nov. 15, latter adding that his concurrence was geared toward progressive activist groups and the Anti-Defamation League.The Biden administration condemned Musk's statement Friday. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,\" the U.S. administration said in statement drawing parallels to the beliefs of the Robert Bowers, who faces the death penalty after the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh left 11 congregants dead.The ADL on Nov. 16 also criticized Musk. \"it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblalt, who on Friday then praised Musk for his condemnation of pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas phrases 'from the river to the sea' and 'decolonization.' Musk said Saturday some of the critics are dangerously using the episode to squelch free speech and that. he plans on suing progressive activists he claims inaccurately showed neo-Nazi and antisemitic posts next to Twitter/X advertisers' promotions.\"I am sticking to my principles. As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,\" Musk said on his social media platform.EXPELLING FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTSThere is a GOP push to expel foreign college students deemed to be supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. government's list of terrorist groups.A group of 21 GOP attorneys general - including Ashley Moody of Florida and Austin Knudsen of Montana - want the federal government to \"vigorously renew vetting of foreign students' and deport those deemed to have endorsed or provided \"material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\" \"It is possible that renewed vetting of foreign students already admitted to the United States may reveal activity that renders them ineligible to hold a student visa and liable to deportation,\" Knudsen, Moody and their cohorts wrote in a letter Nov. 8 to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S.Department of Education.Free speech and civil liberties advocates say the reactions to anti-Israel war protests (some of which have seen antisemitic rhetoric) can bleed into censorship as well as quieting and punishing voices of dissent.\"Free speech means protecting speech you don't like. Sometimes it even means protecting speech you find abhorrent and hateful,\" said U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, after voting against censure measure aimed at U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her anti-Israel rhetoric and use of a pro-Hamas slogan.BANNING PALESTINIAN REFUGEESA group of congressional Republicans - including U.S. Reps. Andy Thomas, who represents the Eastern Shore, along with U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke of Montana and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, are also leading efforts to keep Palestinian refugees from the war out of the U.S. Zinke, Harris and Greene also wants to kick out Palestinians who entered the country on or after Oct. 1 in the aftermath of the Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.They say said he does not trust the Biden administration or Palestinian authorities to adequately screen potential refugees.Critics say the proposal is xenophobic.Similar sentiments related to refugees and college students have been echoed by 2024 GOP presidential candidates such as former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has suspended pro-Palestinian students' groups in his home state deemed extremist and favored restrictions on public library and school curricula content deemed inappropriate or offensive.While conservatives press universities, who have sometimes aggressively banned right-wing voices from their campuses, to condemn and crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, the American Civil Liberties Union wants them to uphold free speech principles.\"It is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus.These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\"The First Amendment protects all people who live in this country, whether they're here as citizens, foreign nationals, or visitors,\" the civil liberties group said.ENCOURAGING MORE HATE CRIME REPORTINGDaines and a bipartisan senators including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, have also recently written to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asking for more investigative and enforcement resources to be dedicated to addressing antisemitism.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 300% increase in anti-Jewish threats, vandalism and violence since the start of the war, which has seen more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 11,000 Gazans killed.In a separate letter, U.S. Sen Jon Tester, D-Montana, also said FBI and DHS efforts should also be focused on white supremacists echoing past and current Biden administration efforts to go after alt-right groups.The Biden White House, which has put a focus on going after right-wing groups since taking office in 2021, has also launched a new task force to go after \"Islamophobia\" during the war.On Tuesday, the FBI said it added Oregon to a nationwide effort aimed at encouraging getting more Americans to report \"hate incidents' ' with billboards posted in Eugene, Medford and Corvallis as well as digital signs at Portland International Airport.Similar hate crime billboards have been put up across the country, including last month in North Carolina, along with ads on public transit systems, social media platforms and local media outlets.Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released new data showing there was a 7.3% increase in reported hate crimes in 2022 (11,634 cases versus 10,840) in 2021.There were more than 6,500 racially motivated incidents - 52% of them aimed at Blacks - and more than 2,000 cases related to religion - with 55% targeting Jews, according to DOJ.SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE, FORCED VERIFICATIONSA state law in Montana backed by Knudsen and GOP Gov.Greg Gianforte banning Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is also one of the central fronts in efforts to restrict social media platforms and content.Montana lawmakers worry about TikTok's data security and ties to the Chinese government.The ban is being mirrored in other states.The Montana prohibition is being challenged by TikTok and free speech advocates in court.But there are also other efforts to increase government regulations and scrutiny and law enforcement surveillance of social media.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Nov. 13 that state police have ramped up social media surveillance and will reach out more to individuals and groups posting hate speech online.\"We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts. What's being said on social media platforms.And we have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity. and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms,\" Hochul said. \"Our media analysis, our social media analysis unit, has ramped up its monitoring of sites to catch incitement to violence; direct threats to others.\" The New York governor said the rise in extremist and violent threats after the start of the war in the Middle East \"poses a clear and present danger.\" But the idea of more aggressive police surveillance of social media posts raises some concerns.Gerard Kassar, chairman of the New York Conservative Party, said police social media monitoring is potentially \"chilling to the core\".\"Law enforcement authorities can and should monitor legitimate terrorism suspects online, but spying on everyday citizens is unconstitutional and wrong,\" Kassar said.Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to require all social media accounts be verified by name thus eliminating anonymous online speech on major platforms.\"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,\" said Haley, who is increasingly being promoted as an establishment and neoconservative 2024 alternative to former president Donald Trump.\"First of all, it's a national security threat. When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say. And it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots. And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what they say, and they know their pastor and their family members are going to see it,\" Haley told Fox News.Haley also backs a TikTok ban pointing to the recent viral traffic of a letter criticizing Israel and the U.S. from Osama Bin Laden.Harris told Fox News Nov. 16 that Congress could soon take some actions related to TikTok and the issue will come down to speech versus national security, citing the platform's Chinese ownership.The verification push sparked a backlash from free speech advocates, particularly on the right who have already been upset over social media bans and content restrictions over coronavirus vaccines and challenges to the 2020 election results.They say it will eliminate anonymous dissent and speech.\"Nikki Haley is 'openly' pushing for the government to use private tech companies to censor speech. This is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and straight out of the Democrats' playbook.Any politician who thinks it's OK for the government to use the private sector as its censorship bureau shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy, who has frequently sparred with Haley over TikTok and other issues. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nTwitter/X, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk gestures during an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRepublican presidential candidates former U.N.

    "content": "Hearn Building project moves toward construction with pivot\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 715\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Green Street Housing is adapting its design plans for the Hearn Building project on Race Street following concerns from Cambridge Planning and Zoning commissioners over ground-floor residential units.After a June 4 Planning and Zoning Commission meeting where Green Street — an affordable housing developer — presented its concept site plan for review, Cambridge City Attorney Patrick Thomas determined that placing apartment units on the ground floor of the the Hearn Building does not comply with the city's Unified Development Code.\n\"So we will be adapting our plans accordingly to prepare for resubmission to the planning commission,\" Green Street Director of Development Chase Powell said in an interview.\nGreen Street hopes to have an updated concept site plan for the commission to review in time for the commission's August meeting, Powell said.\nAt the June 4 meeting, Powell presented his company's plans for 505 and 509 Race Street — a roughly 50,000-square-foot mixed-use development that would include 44 residential units and 4,000 square feet of commercial, office or retail space fronting Race Street.\nPowell said Green Street is financing the project using funding through the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development's Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and the department's loan resources.\n\"And with that comes a high commitment to designed quality and energy-efficiency,\" he said at the meeting.\nCurrently, there are two buildings on the land that Green Street plans to develop. Powell said they plan to raze 505 Race Street and build a new building in its footprint. For the Hearn Building at 509 Race Street, he said Green Street essentially plans to build a building within it.\n\"The Hearn Building is a shell, more or less, with a roof,\" he said. \"So what we are proposing is what I would say, just a phenomenal feat of engineering to put a structure within a structure.\"\nDuring the meeting, Commission Vice Chair William Craig brought up Green Street's plan to put apartment units on the ground level, behind commercial space. He cited a section in the city's Unified Development Code that states residential uses should be located on the upper floors of buildings in the \"core\" subdistrict, which the property is in.\nCraig also pointed to the permitted uses table, which does not permit commercial apartments on the ground floor of a building located in the core subdistrict.\n\"That's what the ordinance says,\" he said. \"And so I don't know how you're going to make it comply with that with this residential on the first floor.\"\nThomas said he hadn't looked into this before the meeting, but agreed with Craig's interpretation of the code.\nNEXT STEPS\nIn an interview, Powell said since the city's determination that there cannot be residential units on the ground floor of the property, Green Street's architect is in the process of reconfiguring the plans to retain as many units as possible.\nAlthough Powell suspects they will not be able to keep all 44 units in the property plans, he thinks the project will still be financially viable.\nCambridge City Planner Holly Baldwin said Green Street will need to to come back to the Planning and Zoning Commission again with the project's preliminary site plan. Once the commission has approved the plan, Green Street will have to submit its final construction plans for review and approval by city engineering and the city's zoning official, Baldwin said.\nPowell said Green Street has had to do a lot of work to help people understand Green Street's intentions with this project.\nIn October, Cambridge Commissioner Brian Roche sent a letter to Maryland Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day requesting a revision to the Hearn Building project plans. Roche said the current plan would further concentrate poverty in an area without an excess of available jobs, would go against Cambridge's Neighborhood Revitalization Plan and its Comprehensive Plan goals and would be an \"excessive\" cost to taxpayers, among other things. Roche also brought up a concern for management issues down the line.\nAt the meeting on June 4, Powell said TM Associates Management, which manages Cambridge apartment New Horizons, will be managing the Hearn Building apartments once the project is complete. He said there shouldn't be concerns about poor management because Green Street is a local developer.\n\"So we're very driven to make sure that everything's being maintained and it's orderly,\" he said. \"Because it's in my backyard, too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot's advanced life support pioneers reflect on program's 40-year mark\n\n August 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 722\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — Pioneers in Talbot County's advanced life support services gathered this week to reminisce on the 40-year anniversary of their revolutionary effort to improve emergency response on the Mid-Shore.Five Easton firefighters began volunteering to man a new advanced life support, or ALS, program on Aug. 13, 1985. They had just one vehicle from the fire department. They sacrificed time at home and kept up constant communication to ensure someone was ready to respond to a cardiac emergency at any given moment.\nThe \"first five,\" as they're often called, were Wayne Dyott, Kevin Knussman, Marc Stockley, Ray Taylor and the late Gary Jones.\nWednesday afternoon inside the Harrison's Harbour Lights restaurant in St. Michaels, the four men shared laughs and memories of the effort they spearheaded four decades ago to the day.\n\"It was quite a haul,\" Stockley recalled. \"And unfortunately, in the past five years, I've been able to use this (ALS) system several times. And seeing the changes. It's been interesting to see the advancements. The care level is always there.\"\nThey were joined by others integral to the early success and soon-to-come expansion of paramedic services in Talbot County: Margie Callahan, then-nurse coordinator at Easton Memorial Hospital, and Buddy Harrison IV, former County Council president and the first director of Talbot County Advanced Life Support.\nThey all took time to reflect on Jones' integral role in the effort.\nJones, former director of cardiovascular services at the Easton hospital, died in 2021. Dyott said Jones joined the fire company in the 1980s knowing the ALS program was about to kick off.\n\"Ultimately, he was a good bridge between hospital staff, them accepting us and bringing the whole program together,\" Stockley said.\n'SKEPTICISM AT FIRST'\nJones and others worked to show people the importance of pre-hospital cardiac care and why countywide ALS services were needed.\nA half-decade ago, response times for heart emergencies could sometimes be 20 to 30 minutes. First responders typically reported to the fire station, then traveled to the location of the emergency.\nTaylor said it was hard at first for fire companies to even accept EMTs back in the 1970s. The five men, certified as cardiac rescue technicians, aimed to change that.\n\"We kept hearing the same thing: 'you're not doctors, you don't need to play doctor on the ambulance,'\" Taylor said.\nFire department and hospital leaders eventually warmed up to the ALS program, Taylor said. It didn't come without questions from the community, Stockley noted.\n\"I think there was skepticism at first, but I think it came around eventually when they started seeing positive results,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Taylor recalled what may have been the first of those positive outcomes. In 1985, he and Dyott rode in the ALS vehicle to the scene of an overturned truck and a man lying down. Taylor successfully defibrillated the man, and that began to turn heads in the right direction.\n\"It's a good feeling,\" Taylor recalled.\nIMPACT FELT TODAY\nSince 1985, the modest five-person, volunteer venture in Easton has transformed to a countywide staple. The Talbot County Department of Emergency Services operates six ALS units and one \"chase vehicle\" for rapid response. Over 50 paramedics and EMTs staff the units, some full-time and others volunteers.\nThe hard work of the original five was done with the hope of having a comprehensive system like the one that exists today, Dyott said.\n\"That's what we started. That was our goal, our ambition,\" he said.\nTina Kintop, Talbot's EMS division chief, said the division's current success and bandwidth wouldn't be possible without those pioneers. Crews responded to around 6,800 calls last year, she noted.\n\"We are better prepared and educated more than ever in the life-saving business,\" Kintop wrote. \"Thank you to the visionaries 40 years ago and to those advancing ahead today.\"\nCallahan similarly credits the first five for persevering through the doubts and paramedic funding struggles in 1985 and the years after.\n\"They were a part of seeing this all come to fruition,\" she said.\nOver the last 40 years, it has always been about saving lives, said Talbot County's original ALS leaders. Knussman said all the vehicle swaps and early morning phone calls were well worth it.\n\"I think all of us would agree that the people on the street today are better trained, better educated, better equipped and better organized,\" Knussman said. \"That's something that all four of us, and Gary if he were here, that's something to be proud of.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobson grew up around the fire house, always knowing he wanted to be a firefighter.In his teenage years, Dobson joined the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company as a junior cadet, and by 16 he began riding the fire trucks. He fondly recalls the \"everybody knew everybody\" aspect of the tight-knit community.\nDobson eventually moved to Easton, beginning his journey with the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in 2003. Over time, he's served in a number of roles, including most recently, assistant chief.\nNow he's taking on the department's top role for the first time. Dobson was elected the department's chief in December.\nWith a wife and two daughters, timing was everything for Dobson when considering the commitment to assume a role as demanding as Easton fire chief. The timing is right, he said, and he's looking forward to leading and making a difference.\n\"There's a lot of tradition here,\" Dobson said. \"It's certainly the biggest department in the county. It's got probably the most going on out of all the departments in the county. I think just being here, seeing how this department operates versus a small department. It's a business. And we're all here for free, none of us get paid.\"\nDobson officially began as chief this month. Sonny Jones just wrapped up his third two-year term leading the department.\nDobson, who volunteers at the fire department as all the firefighters do, is a patrol and operations commander at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. He believes his experience leading around 35 deputies across multiple divisions will translate to his duties in the fire house.\n\"I think that I bring a lot of management skills, leadership skills,\" Dobson said. \"Just from my experience there, I think it helps you here.\"\nThus far, Dobson says the support he's received has been \"overwhelming.\"\nPast fire chiefs have reached out, and he hopes to pick up one thing from each of them to set himself up for success. For instance, Jones' ability as an incident commander is something Dobson admires.\n\"If there were ever a bad day anybody was having, he's who you would want there,\" Dobson said of Jones. \"Just the way he kind of rolls through an incident scene. He's been there and done that kind of thing.\"\nSimilarly, Jones — who is remaining involved with the department — spoke highly of Dobson.\n\"I've known J.R. the entire time that I've been a member of the Easton fire department,\" Jones said. \"J.R. is a first-rate guy. He's a terrific leader. He has many, many qualities which will bode well for him as the chief of the department.\"\nSome of the ongoing projects the new fire chief has his eye on include purchasing a utility vehicle to use for Rails to Trails and woods fires, buying a new engine and updating box alarm assignments. He also wants to implement some new standard operating procedures.\nDobson said he hopes to nail down a handful of tasks for the year and keep circling back to see what progress is being made. At the top of his list is recruitment and retention of volunteers.\n\"I think it all starts with recruiting. I think it all starts with retention,\" Dobson said. \"Those are things that we've done well in the past, although the last year or so we haven't gotten as many members as we would like. And sometimes we'll get members in and they don't realize the commitment.\"\nWhile acknowledging the town's consistent support of the department over the years, Dobson believes Easton Fire can do better in attracting more volunteers amid struggles statewide and nationwide to fill volunteer fire departments.\n\"We got to get people in here,\" Dobson said. \"We've got to get these trucks out. And I think that the way the town's growing, if we don't grow with it, then we're failing ourselves.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tunis Mills bridge replacement project moves forward\n\n January 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 629\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — A beloved bridge in the Tunis Mills community is moving toward reconstruction after months of resident input into the bridge's redesign.In recent years, the 345-foot-long Leeds Creeks Bridge and its wood planks have deteriorated. County engineers consider the bridge structurally deficient, necessitating a replacement.\nTuesday, the Talbot County Council agreed to move forward with the bridge replacement project. County Engineer Ray Clarke recommended the county work toward finalizing rights-of-way acquisitions and necessary permits so construction can be pursued later this year.\nAs proposed, the replacement would include a wooden deck and a timber wearing surface. The structures below the bridge supporting it, known as piles, would consist of concrete and steel materials.\nClarke told council members that in order to use federal funding for the project, the bridge replacement project cannot use timber piles per the State Highway Administration. He added that trying to build an all-timber replacement will cause significant delays and costs.\n\"The big disadvantage we have is that if we don't get the federal aid, we're probably going to need to request the council for additional funding for the project, local funding,\" Clarke said. \" … This could be a $3 or $4 million ask.\"\nThe project costs around $6.5 million, with $1.5 million coming from the county. The rest is federally funded.\nAdvocates of a 100% wooden replacement have been in dialogue with the county, including at an August public meeting. Susan McDermott and John Tabori, two of those advocates, have lived in Tunis Mills next to the bridge for four years.\nMcDermott says the original proposal to rebuild the bridge many years ago \"was just unacceptable to the community.\" The county's recent proposal matches more of what she and some other neighbors had hoped for.\n\"We're very pleased that the council has shown as much flexibility toward community views as it has,\" McDermott said.\nResidents like McDermott previously expressed concerns that an asphalt wearing surface would encourage speeding across the bridge. The county's plans now include a timber wearing surface. Clarke said that change will amount to around a $250,000 increase.\nThe other main change based on community feedback is a reduction in the height of the safety railing from 42 to 36 inches.\nMcDermott, who leads a small group of neighbors called the Tunis Mills All-Timber Bridge Alliance, hopes to find answers to whether an exception can be made for the requirement that piles not be timber.\nShe adds that the bridge is an integral part of the community.\n\"I think the town feels that the wooden bridge of Tunis Mills — one of the last wooden-deck bridges in the county — is very much part of the community,\" McDermott said. \"It's not just a bridge that occasional traffic goes across. We've got a lot of walkers in this neighborhood, a lot of kids and people just use that bridge as a foot path.\"\nAfter a video of the bridge was shown during the meeting, Talbot County Council Member Lynn Mielke said it seems the replacement \"needs to be done sooner rather than later.\"\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher thanked Clarke and his team for their efforts to advance the replacement project.\n\"I appreciate the homework that you've done to investigate the alternatives as requested and appreciate that we really can't sacrifice the federal aid,\" Lesher said. \"The economics of this project dictate that we absolutely need to go with the recommended steel concrete pilings and concrete cap.\"\nLesher motioned to approve the project as presented, and the rest of the council unanimously agreed. Lesher added that he hopes the federal funding for the project comes through, referencing President Donald Trump's temporary pause on federal grants and loans announced earlier this week and rescinded Wednesday.\n\"And we'll just hope that any suspension of federal grant aid for transportation projects is very short-lived,\" Lesher said Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland House and Garden tour lets visitors explore Talbot County properties\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Standing in the foyer of Canterbury Manor in Easton, one's eyes might dart straight out the window to the luscious green grounds that look out onto Trippe Creek.Or their eyes might be drawn to the estate's light and airy living room, which boasts a Steinway Piano from the 1920s, English furniture, and French and Dutch paintings. But no matter where the eye goes first, it's undeniable that it won't take long to feel drawn into the 1906 colonial revival style home.\nFor Easton resident Summer Parrish, it was the design of the kitchen — complete with French copper pots hanging above a big kitchen island — and the large but cozy-feeling butler's pantry.\n\"Oh my gosh,\" she said, talking about various parts of the house. \"The flower arrangements that are in (the) sun porch and on the kitchen table are the most beautiful I've every seen in my entire life.\"\nCanterbury Manor was the second home Parrish and her family members, including her sister and mother, toured on the Saturday of Mother's Day weekend. The Talbot County tour is part of the Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage, which was started in 1937. Proceeds go toward the preservation and restoration of historically significant properties in the state.\nParrish's mother, Hope Leuchter, said comparing the first home they visited — a 1928 two-and-a-half story central brick mansion called Ellenborough — to Canterbury Manor is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\"The first one has the most magnificent trees,\" Leuchter said. \"And if you're crazy for trees and their botanical names and love their lore, that would have been it. Here (at Canterbury Manor), the artistry, the effectiveness of colors and choices. The home is beyond words beautiful.\"\nEvery two years, the pilgrimage brings Marylanders from all over the state to ooh and aah at historic architecture, grand gardens and fragrant floral arrangements in Talbot County. Most of the flowers in the arrangements are from the gardens of Talbot County Garden Club members.\nThe money raised from the Talbot County tour \"by and large\" stays in the county, Talbot tour co-chair Kim Eckert said. This year, the Talbot County Garden Club, which organizes the tour, chose to put proceeds toward Scotts United Methodist Church and St. Paul's Episcopal Church, both in Trappe.\n\"We wanted to focus on houses in Trappe, and we thought the best thing to do was to put the money back into Trappe,\" Eckert said.\nThe funds raised from the tour will go toward fully fixing and preserving both of the more than 250-year-old churches. Eckert said Lane Engineering and McHale Landscape Design both donated or discounted services to help make this possible. She said the Garden Club will even have some money left over to put toward other projects, such as the Talbot Historical Society gardens.\nAlong with Canterbury Manor and Ellenborough, tour-goers also had the opportunity to visit Easton's 219 S. Hanson St. and Trappe's Chloras Point Farm, Ferry Farm House, Trappe Landing Farm and Lloyds Landing.\n\"You get a really neat collection of Talbot County's homes, from the grand estates to the regular, beautiful farm homes,\" said Jack Thompson, executive director of the Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage.\nAt Lloyds Landing, an 18th century house on the Choptank River in Trappe, Sherwood resident Kevin Carnahan took in the history of the property. The house, erected between 1720 and 1730, is one of the only eight remaining structures from that era in the county.\n\"They all have a lot of history,\" Carnahan said about the four homes he had visited so far. \"But this one in particular.\"\nMontgomery County resident Lynn Konefal talked about the pieces of history in the house, like the old family photos hanging on the walls.\nAnd even though it's one of the oldest structures in the county, Lloyds Landing was built with air conditioning and heat in mind, Eckert said.\n\"Based on how the roof is pitched and how it's located to the Choptank,\" she said. \"It's mind-boggling to me that they designed all that in 1729.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Defending North Bayside champion Queen Anne’s County among teams trying to fill graduation holes in an attempt for another deep playoff\n\n September 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n North Bayside boys soccer coaches have been busy this preseason — and during the early weeks of the regular season — mending holes in their lineups.Defending division champion Queen Anne's County High, which went 13-3-1 and reached the Class 2A state semifinals a year ago, graduated eight, including six starters.\n\"The guys that we lost were huge parts,\" Lions head coach Wade Hosler said.\nNorth Caroline head coach John Austin can sympathize after graduating seven, including 2023 North Bayside Player of the Year Logan Harned.\n\"I feel as a conference we lost a lot of really good players,\" Austin said. \"Last year's conference was very, very senior heavy.\"\nA handful of those graduates are now playing in the collegiate ranks, with North Caroline's Harned at Neumann (Pa.) University and goalie Gavin O'Brien at Frostburg State, while Queen Anne's has Billy Schindler at Washington College.\nThe Class 1A ranks also felt graduation's sting. North Dorchester lost 10, while Cambridge-South Dorchester first-year head coach Josh Dohoney is trying to patch holes created by almost half of dozen losses.\nIn addition to the Vikings, Easton welcomes former standout Avery Brice as its new head coach, while Kent County begins the Dennis Hickman era.\nQueen Anne's shared the conference title with James M. Bennett in 2021, but the last North team to win the Bayside championship outright was Kent Island in 2016, when the Bucs topped Stephen Decatur in penalty kicks. The Bucs and Lions look to be on another collision course to decide the North when they meet in Stevensville on Oct. 18, though North Caroline and Easton figure to also be atop the division ranks.\nThe South's dominance of the conference crown could be extended this year, as Bennett, which lost to eventual Class 3A state champion South River in last year's postseason, returns the bulk of its team from a season ago.\nHere's a look at this year's North Bayside teams.\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Josh Dohoney.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Nate Huber (Sr.); Backs: Osvaldo Hernandez (Jr.); Evan Kozak (Sr.); Colton Phillips (So.); Gibby Robinson (So.); Midfield: Lucas Harper (So.); Gavin Weber (So.); Ryan Harris (Sr.); Forwards: Will Banks (Jr.); Wyatt Abbott (So.); Marcos Hernandez (Fr.).\nOutlook: After one year as an assistant, Dohoney begins his first head coaching job in soccer knowing he'll need to be patient.\n\"We're very young. Very much a rebuilding squad,\" said Dohoney, who played at Delmar, Del.\nThe Vikings graduated more than half a dozen from last year, including center midfielder Randall Johnson. The midfield looks technically sound, but with five sophomores and one freshman starting, Dohoney hopes this will be a season of growth.\nCOL. RICHARDSON\nHead Coach: Dillon Shaheen.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Cohen Carels (Sr.); Backs: Cameron Todd (Sr.); Jacklin Novembre (Jr.); Jackson Jean Jr. (Jr.); Caleb Rouser (So.); Midfield: John Beaven (So.); Jack Walls (Jr.); Preston Rickwood (Sr.); Ludver Vasquez (Jr.); Aydan Downie (Sr.); Forwards: Morgan Demir (Sr.); Angel Castro-Rios (Sr.); Skyler Endzel (Fr.); Brody Omohundro (Fr.).\nOutlook: Shaheen begins his third year as head coach with his most experienced team he's had. That has translated into victories over Pocomoke and North Dorchester for starters.\n\"It's been pretty good so far,\" said Shaheen, who lost three seniors from last year. \"Obviously we have a lot of seniors and juniors, and most have been playing at the varsity level for three or four years. I'm pretty confident in our squad this year.\"\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Avery Brice.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Sam Hutchison (Jr.); Backs: Mario Medina (Sr.); Felix Valentine (Jr.); Brody Byrnes (Sr.); Kai Ferraris (Jr.); Landon Chaney (Sr.); Midfield: Clay Nagle (Sr.); Luke Stanco (Jr.); CJ Chaconas (Sr.); Blake Royer (So.); Ale Monroy (So.); Dominic Stanco (Sr.); Otto Perez-Arreaga (Fr.); Logan Sundt (Jr.); Liam Edgell (Sr.); Forwards: Kyle Ensminger (Jr.); Rodi Fresco Rubio (Jr.).\nOutlook: Brice was a center midfielder on Easton's last two teams to win Bayside titles (2013, '14) and helped the Warriors reach the 2A state final in '14 before continuing his playing career at Wesley (Del.) College.\nNow, he steps into his first head coaching job.\n\"Things are shaping up nicely,\" Brice said. \"Could things be better? Yes. That's kind of one thing that we just hope to do every day in the season; just be better than the day before.\"\nWhile the Warriors have been receptive to their new coach's ideas and style, Brice stressed they must strive for consistency.\n\"The mindset is you can be really good, but every game you've got to bring it,\" Brice said.\nKENT COUNTY\nHead Coach: Dennis Hickman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Leyder Cruz (Sr.); Backs: Noah Iacona (Jr.); Jayden Miller (So.); Stewart Hickman (Jr.); Bryce Jacobs (So.); Midfield: Nick Stead (Sr.); Colbyn Lopez (Jr.); Ethan Clark (Sr.); Forwards: Gabe Parr (So.); Dylan Peralta (Fr.); Sebastian Cousineau (So.).\nOutlook: A 1993 graduate of Kent County, Hickman, who played soccer, baseball and wrestled for the Trojans, takes over as head coach after spending the last two years as an assistant.\nIn an attempt to build a program, Hickman has already achieved one goal in fielding a junior varsity for the first time since 2019.\n\"We think by having a jayvee, getting them out there on practice, getting them those reps and having some game-time situations and play, that we're only going to be able to build on that moving forward,\" Hickman said. \"It's just the best thing for the program.\"\nThat coupled with a varsity roster that includes nine juniors and nine sophomores, could bode well for the future.\nAs for this year's team, there isn't a lot of experience, though Stewart Hickman has plenty of travel ball experience, as has recruited players over the summer to come out for the team.\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Lin Outten.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Quinn Burns (Fr.); Backs: Davis Miller (Sr.); Noah Scopp (Sr.); Gavin Neboshynsky (Sr.); Mark Rees (Sr.); Spencer Chappell (Jr.); Elijah James (So.); Midfield: Simon Vujinovic (Sr.); Brendan Thomas (Jr.); Cooper Liebel (So.); Landon Pecor (Jr.); Forwards: AJ Miller (Jr.); Eric Hoffman (Sr.); Ethan Schriver (Sr.); Robert Simkins (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Bucs have a lot of experience moving from the midfield into the attack, but are not as experienced in the back. Though seniors Davis Miller, Scopp and Rees return, Outten hopes shifting Neboshynsky and Chappell from midfield to the back bolsters his defense.\nAJ Miller netted 10 goals a year ago, and Outten thinks that number will go up, especially with the return of Hoffman, who missed the bulk of last year with an early season injury.\n\"But really what makes the engine go is the three guys in the middle — Thomas, Vujinovic and Liebel,\" Outten said.\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: John Austin.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Mason Shilling (Jr.); Backs: Lewis Higgs (Jr.); Brayden Boarts (Sr.); Jimmy Cohoon (Jr.); Midfield: Ayden Russell (Jr.); Tyler Gutierrez (Jr.); Omar Marroquin (Sr.); Jonnathan Luna Feliciano (Jr.); Diego Castro (So.); Landyn Harned (So.); Kyle Reed (Jr.); Forwards: Heath Frantum (Jr.); Issac Bautista (Jr.); Luke Raga (So.).\nOutlook: The Bulldogs graduated seven from a year ago, including Harned, O'Brien, and also lost leading scorer Kevin Godinez.\nAustin thinks his team will be more defensive-minded this season. The defense is led by Shilling, who Austin thinks has college potential. Shilling and company figure to be tested early, as the Bulldogs open with defending conference champion James M. Bennett, Class 2A state semifinalist Queen Anne's, and perennial conference heavyweight Stephen Decatur.\n\"We have a lot of holes to fill,\" Austin said. \"I think we are where we need to be right now. But the goal is can we just keep getting better as the year goes on, and then when October rolls around, play our best soccer?\"\nNORTH DORCHESTER\nHead Coach: Gabe Guzman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Jayden Coleman (Jr.); Backs: Chris Sanchez (Jr.); Tahjere Pritchett (Jr.); Alex Fonseca-Gonzalez (So.); Martin Chirino Fernandez (Jr.); Midfield: Christian Chase (Jr.); Peyton Bleyer (So.); Daniel Mejia (Sr.); Kegan Henry (Jr.); Forwards: Volcy Nerat (Fr.); Dagoberto Chirino Fernandez.\nOutlook: The Eagles graduated 10, including seven starters. Among Guzman's top priorities is getting his freshman to buy into his system and get acclimated to the high school varsity format.\n\"We're working on trust,\" Guzman said.\nQUEEN ANNE'S\nHead Coach: Wade Hosler.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Ethan Keppler (Sr.); Backs: Christian Coppage (Sr.); Conner Cheezum (Sr.); Hayden Albright (Sr.); Brody Nordvik (Jr.); Midfield: James Rath (Jr.); Gage Jordan (Sr.); Nathan Kostka (Jr.); Mason Albright (Sr.); Boden Blodgett (So.); Josiah Hegarty (So.); Forwards: Ryan Lee (Sr.).\nOutlook: \"The preseason seemed awfully short this year, and our chemistry wasn't quite where I'd like it this time of year,\" Hosler said. \"But I think it's coming, so I'm optimistic that we can do good things. We've had good moments and we've had mistakes. But I like the direction we're heading in.\"\nHosler has also liked his team's 3-0-1 start, which included Monday's 3-0 shutout of North Caroline.\nDespite its big graduation losses, the Lions do have a solid core of returners. Outside backs Coppage and Cheezum return along with Keppler in goal. Jordan is back in the midfield while Lee returns at striker.\n\"We have some big pieces, but we still have some big holes to fill,\" said Hosler, who graduation losses included Schindler, center back William Nagle and leading scorer Nick Esper. \"If we can have some guys step up I think we'll be OK.\"\nST. MICHAELS\nHead Coach: Pat Hambleton.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Will Sherwood (Sr.); Backs: Tyler Murphy (Jr.); Jack Brennan (Sr.); Sherwin Mendez (Sr.); Brennan Dean (Jr.); Midfield: Ethan Royer (Jr.); Gavin Bieber (Fr.); Johnny Mautz (Jr.); Abel Delgaudio (So.); Forwards: Connor Wheeler (Jr.); Miles Fox (Jr.); Haven Haddaway (Sr.).\nOutlook: Having Sherwood — first-team all-North Bayside goalie the past two years — and an experienced returning defensive unit should make the Saints plenty tough.\nWhile that provides Hambleton comfort, he also liked what he has seen on the offensive end.\n\"Finally creative,\" Hambleton said of his attack. \"We're going to be an enjoyment to watch. Still have an older group to support our creative offensive style. I have players to make it a pretty game finally. And they get it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Biden in a bind: Left-wing, anti-war pressure challenges reelection, long-standing support for Israel\n\n March 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 1075\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. military started air dropping aid into Gaza Saturday as U.S. President Joe Biden faces pressure from many Democrats who want Israel to agree to a ceasefire in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks.Anti-war and pro-Palestinian pressure from the left challenges Biden's long-standing support for Israel as he faces a tight reelection race against former president Donald Trump.\nBiden has also received more financial support from pro-Israel groups and advocates than any other U.S. politician over the last four decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics which looked at campaign donations since 1990.\nU.S. MILITARY DROPPING AID IN GAZA\nAccording to the Associated Press, U.S. military C-130 cargo planes on Saturday dropped food in pallets over Gaza, three U.S. officials said, two days after more than 100 Palestinians who had surged to pull goods off an aid convoy were killed during a chaotic encounter with Israeli troops.\nThree planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST, according to two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity before a public announcement, the AP reported.\nBiden said Friday the U.S. would start air dropping aid into the Hamas-controlled Palestinian area where more than 30,000 people have died since the start of the war. Another 7,800 people are missing with a good number of those presumed dead within the rubble of the Holy Land war.\nMore than 1,400 Israelis have died since the war started in October. Israeli officials say they have killed 10,000 Hamas and other Islamic militant fighters in the war.\nEarlier in the week before the Michigan presidential primary, Biden played up the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza. Yesterday and today, Biden also talked up a potential 6-week ceasefire that could start before the Muslim holiday of Ramadan (which begins March 10).\nBut Hamas continues to hold Israeli hostages taken In the Oct. 7 attacks and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to continue the war to dismantle the Islamic militant group.\n\"This week a Harvard CAPS-Harris poll was published; it determined that 82% of the American public supports Israel. That is to say - more than 4 out 5 U.S. citizens support us and not Hamas. This broad support gives us redoubled energy to continue the campaign until total victory,\" Netanyahu said in a statement.\nBIDEN'S LONG SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL\nBiden has been a steadfast supporter of Israel during this 51-year tenure in U.S. politics, while serving in the U.S. as vice president in the Obama administration and now as U.S. president.\nBiden has declared himself \"a Zionist\" supporting the Jewish state of Israel on multiple occasions including in December at Hanukkah celebration at the White House.\nSince 1990, Biden has received close to $10 million in donations from pro-Israel groups and advocates according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's the most of any U.S. politician.\nBut Public opinion polls show wide swaths of Democrats, especially younger and Muslim voters, support a ceasefire and oppose Netanyahu's war after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nThat showed up in the Michigan primary where 13.2% of Democrats voted uncommitted and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, who was not actively campaigning, got 3% of the vote.\nMichigan is a key battleground in the general election.\nTrump received 758,892 votes in the GOP primary versus Nikki Haley compared to 623,415 for Biden who isn't facing substantial opposition.\nPRESSURE FROM THE LEFT\nLeft-wing advocates — including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont — have stepped up their pushes against Israel's war in Gaza and want to put more strings on U.S. military aid to Israel — which totals more than $3 billion annually.\n\"Netanyahu and his right-wing government have created a catastrophe in Gaza. Today Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians desperate for aid. The U.S. must push for a cease-fire, hostage releases, & condition military support on pursuing a two-state solution for a lasting peace,\" Warren said Feb. 29.\nSanders is also pushing against U.S. support for Netanyahu's government and Israel's war effort against Hamas.\nThe U.S. government designates the Islamic group as a terrorist organization.\n\"Children are starving in Gaza. Instead of opening up the borders and allowing humanitarian aid to come in, Israeli soldiers are shooting people who are desperately trying to get food off of trucks. This must stop. The U.S. cannot continue funding the Netanyahu war machine,\" Sanders said Feb. 29.\nThat has pushed Biden and his presidential campaign – which is in 50/50 race with Trump — to press for a ceasefire and launch the airdrops.\n\"We're trying to work out a deal between Israel and Hamas (with) the hostages being returned and (an) immediate ceasefire in Gaza for at least the next six weeks,\" Biden said.\nCLOSED BORDERS\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is magnified by Egypt and Jordan refusing to allow Palestinian refugees from their war zones into their countries, the lack of international pressure, including from other Muslim countries and Europe, on Hamas to release Israeli hostages and Palestinian militants also wanting to keep civilians in Gaza as shields against Israel Defense Forces and over worries about Israel taking over the area after the war.\nInternational aid groups — many of which are critical of Israel and U.S. support for the war with some taking pro-Palestinian stances in the Middle East conflict— have said the U.S. aid is more about optics than alleviating suffering from war.\n\"Oxfam does not support U.S. airdrops to Gaza, which would mostly serve to relieve the guilty consciences of senior U.S. officials whose policies are contributing to the ongoing atrocities and risk of famine in Gaza,\" said Scott Paul, associate director for Oxfam America. \"While Palestinians in Gaza have been pushed to the absolute brink, dropping a paltry, symbolic amount of aid into Gaza with no plan for its safe distribution would not help and be deeply degrading to Palestinians.\"\nAid groups have criticized Israel for not allowing more aid via trucks amid concerns from the IDF that those supplies have and will continue to be taken by Hamas.\nIDF officials said the Thursday event where Gazans were killed during a chaotic mob scene involving an aid convoy only involved Israeli soldiers firing warning shots to try to disperse the mob.\n\"This morning humanitarian aid trucks entered northern Gaza, residents surrounded the trucks and looted the supplies being delivered. As a result of the pushing, trampling and being run over by the trucks, dozens of Gazans were killed and injured,\" an IDF spokesman said Thursday.\nPalestinians contend the IDF shot at the Gazans resulting in the stampede. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mobsters, spies, anarchists, Klan members - and Trump - Prosecutors use racketeering, spy and Reconstruction laws in Trump criminal indictments\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former president Donald Trump has been charged like mobster and drug kingpin in Georgia, like an anarchist and foreign spy in Florida and like a post-Civil War Ku Klux Klan member in Washington D.C. as he faces now a quartet of criminal charges in the run-up to 2024 election.Trump was indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury along with 2024 campaign cohorts and attorneys - including Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows - over attempts to reverse President Joe Biden's 11,779-vote win in the Peach State.Part of that indictment includes racketeering charges conventionally used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs.\"The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia's legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia's presidential election result,\" Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, said during a late-night news conference Monday, Aug. 14, announcing the indictment of the former president and leading 2024 GOP White House candidate.The indictment includes RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations), making false statements and other election meddling charges. The criminal charges to making false statements, like some of other federal allegations against Trump, will face First Amendment free speech counterarguments.Across the U.S., RICO cases have commonly been used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs including John Gotti's Gambino Crime Family, the Hells Angels, Latin Kings and the Cowboy Mafia, which used shrimp boats to smuggle illegal marijuana in the late 1970. There have been RICO charges used in some corporate and other corruption cases including 2022 indictments of some current and former soccer officials associated with FIFA and CONCACAF.In Georgia, RICO convictions could potentially bring prison terms of 5 to 20 years.According to the Associated Press, the Trump indictment includes criminal charges related to \"attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to Trump.\" \"In one particularly brazen episode, it also outlines a plot involving one of his lawyers to access voting machines in a rural Georgia county and steal data from a voting machine company,\" the AP writes.Like with his federal indictments and charges in New York of filing false business claims to cover up alleged hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model, Karen McDougal, Trump lambasted the charges as politically motivated falsehoods aimed to undermining his 2024 White House bid.\"Can you believe it? This failed District Attorney from Atlanta, Fani Willis, where murders and other violent crime soars daily to new record highs, is charging me with 2020 Presidential Election Interference. No, Fani, the only Election Interference was done by those that Rigged and Stole the Election,\" Trump said in a statement on social media platform Truth Social. \"Those are the ones you should be going after, not the innocent people that are fighting for Election Integrity!\" Ellis and Guiliani, who served as Trump campaign lawyers, say they are being charged criminally for providing legal advice. \"The Democrats and the Fulton County DA are criminalizing the practice of law,\" Ellis said in a social media statement.U.S. Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has invoked federal grand juries in Florida and D.C. to indict Trump via the 1917 Espionage Act over his alleged misappropriation of classified documents and a post-Civil War law aimed at violent harassment by the Ku Klux Klan over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and efforts to derail Congress' certification of Biden as the 2020 election winner.The Espionage Act has been previously used against Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Julius and Ethen Rosenbereg and early 20th Century anarchist writer Emma Goldman.All told, Trump, 77, could potentially be jailed for the rest of his life if convicted and sentenced aggressively by state and federal judges.Tung Yin, a law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, said jury selections will be very important in the cases against Trump and prospective jurors may hide their love, disdain or other views toward the former Republican president.\"That person might give very bland answers during jury selection,\" XXX said. \"It would be very hard to ferratt someone like this out. you get one person out of 12 you have a hung jury.\" The timing of the trials could run into and potentially after the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign elections.Yin sees the classified documents case where Trump is accused of improperly taking classified materials from the White House to his Florida estate as the stronger of the federal prosecutions.If convicted, Trump, the leading opposition candidate currently to President Biden, could potentially be jailed.For example, Jan. 6th charges in D.C. (which Biden won over Trump 92% to 5%) could result in Trump going to a federal prison for between 57 to 71 months, according to an estimate from Yin. That's between just under four and almost six years.Politically, as expected, Trump-aligned Republicans criticized the Georgia indictment while Democrats and progressives hailed the effort to convict and potentially imprison the bombastic populist former president. \n \n Caption: CHARLIE NEIBERGALL\n \nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump greets supporters at the Iowa Pork Producers tent during a visit to the Iowa State Fair, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa.\n \nJOHN BAZEMORE\n \nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks in the Fulton County Government Center during a news conference, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, in Atlanta.

Thompkins began striking the woman with his fists, then brandished a knife to stab her neck.The woman ran from her vehicle and collapsed in the front yard of a nearby house. Thompkins cradled her while holding the knife to his own throat, Franklin said.A witness attempted to help the victim but Thompkins threatened them, pointing the knife at them and yelling for them to get back.Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police and Maryland Natural Resources Police, responded to the stabbing.Franklin said Thompkins punctured his own neck with a knife while running to the woods, evading officers.After 15 minutes and the use of multiple non-lethal methods, including a taser, to diffuse the situation, a state trooper was able to knock the knife out of Thompkins' hand to detain him, police said.Both Thompkins and the woman were flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore for treatment of their injuries.Following his arrest, a judge found Thompkins incompetent to stand trial in April 2022.He was committed to the Maryland Department of Health until August of this year, then transferred back to a local detention center upon being found competent, according to court filings.In court Monday, Franklin said he will recommend a 30-year sentence with all but 15 years of active incarceration suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation and special mental health conditions.State sentencing guidelines recommend five to 10 years, said Jesse Hicks, Thompkins' attorney. The plea is not binding, meaning a judge has the ability to impose a higher or lower sentence than what is recommended.Sentencing will be deferred until Feb. 1, 2024. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER\n \nPolice on scene in Preston for a reported stabbing Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester Burial Sites Preservation Board gets another chance\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 717\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A board designed to help preserve grave sites in Dorchester County has one year to prove it is able to accomplish its mission or it will face dissolution.After holding a public hearing about repealing a chapter of the county code regarding burial sites preservation, the Dorchester County Council agreed Jan. 21 to keep the chapter — which includes the Burial Sites Preservation Board established within it — for a test period.\n\"A one-year test from today to see what you can accomplish and see if it is a worthy board to have within this county,\" Council Member Ricky Travers said before making the motion.\nThroughout the public hearing and following discussion, council members brought up concerns of past problems with the board's participation and its ability to work cohesively. Council President Lenny Pfeffer said that in the one-year test period, the board would need to prove it can fill its seats and provide a quorum at its meetings.\nTravers said board members would need to work together, not against each other as has been the case in the past.\n\"As passionate as people might be about grave sites, ... we cannot have this controversy,\" Travers said. \"So whomever comes on that board needs to be willing and ready to work side-by-side.\"\nCounty Planning and Zoning Director Susan Webb said the Maryland Historical Trust is the state's enforcing entity regarding burial sites preservation.\n\"And we were basically duplicating the effort,\" she said. \"While this may be a good board for a nonprofit, being under the county's umbrella, I don't think it's working out.\"\nDorothy Samonisky, the chair of the Burial Sites Preservation Board, said the Maryland Historical Trust only gives guidance and does not \"act as an arm of the law\" like the county can.\n\"So right now, this burial site preservation is the only thing that gives you as county members anything to stand on if there is an incident with a grave site.\"\nPfeffer clarified that the board is an advisory group to the council.\nSamonisky said people have been buried in Dorchester County since 1669, and many of those burial sites are on private property. She said the policy in county code gives the county the authority to \"act upon destruction of those cemeteries.\"\nAshley Samonisky, who also spoke during public comment, said the board can guide council actions and help with outreach and education. She said there needs to be something in the code that addresses what happens if a person \"maliciously destroy(s) a property or (tries) to hide the fact that it was there,\" in order to build a beach house, for example.\n\"There needs to be fines,\" she said. \"There needs to be penalties up to and including the cost of restoring it to the pre-demolition stage. These are just a few ideas that this body can help with.\"\nDorothy Samonisky acknowledged that there were \"internal conflicts\" between several board members at one point. She said she also was out due to two major surgeries in 2024.\n\"We had met up through '23 and had things on the agenda and topics to discuss,\" she said.\nCouncil Vice President Mike Detmer, who ultimately voted in favor of the board having a one-year test period, said he thinks the board has value, but would function better if not affiliated with the county.\n\"It being a law and having to be constituted a certain way and done a certain way is holding an effort to preserve burial sites back,\" he said, later adding, \"I think it could be more flexible and more dynamic as a stand-alone.\"\nDetmer said as long as he is on the council, if someone comes to the council with \"a salient point\" about something in the county, it will get attention. That doesn't require a board, he said.\nBefore the council unanimously agreed to give the board a test period, Travers said the board had previously gone through an \"extremely adversary\" time that got to the point where some board members felt unsafe coming to the meetings. He said the county practically had to act as a referee.\n\"And that's not what we need on our boards,\" he said.\nPfeffer warned the this can't happen again.\n\"The last board that was assembled ... had brought things to this chamber,\" he said. \"Had brought thoughts of slander. Had brought disagreements. I will not allow that to happen during these meetings.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Deepening Divides - Democrats Split Over 'Anti-Zionism Is Antisemitism' Measure; Poll Shows U.S. Racial, Generational Differences Over Israel-Hamas War\n\n December 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 954\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday declaring that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism\" prompting a split among Democrats.A majority of House Democrats did not vote for the measure as a public opinion poll from Gallup shows substantial divides among Americans over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza by age, race and political persuasion.\nWhites, older voters and Republicans tend to back Israel in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks while younger Americans, people of color and Democrats disapprove of Israel's air strikes and ground invasion of Gaza aimed at the Islamic militant group, according to a poll released Nov. 30 by Gallup.\nThe congressional measure condemning antisemitism passed with support from 216 Republicans and 95 Democrats. The resolution's most controversial component was plank equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nZionism is a movement and belief system that supports the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East.\n\"Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThirteen Democrats voted against the measure and 105 Dems voted 'present' or did not vote neither supporting nor opposing the resolution.\nOne Republican - U.S.\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the anti-Zionism/antisemitism measure. Another four GOP lawmakers did not vote.\n\"Anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism,\" Massie said in a social media statement pointing to congressional remarks by U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, that some Orthodox and other Jews are not in agreement with modern Zionist constructs.\nNadler, the House's most senior Jewish members, said some Orthodox Jews believe only the Messiah can establish a new state of Israel and the measure can label progressive Jews and others critical of controversial judicial reforms in Israel as antisemitic.\nNadler and U.S. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, were among those voting present on antisemitism measure.\nThe 13 Democratic no votes came from progressives who have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\nOpponents of the measure - which referenced rises antisemitic vandalism and violence - included U.S. Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \"We must be steadfast and clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors and inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful,\" said Jayapal who had to clarify recent comments about whether she condemned Hamas' rapes and violence against women and girls in the Oct. 7.\nGOP SUPPORTS MEASURE U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, voted for the antisemitism measure along with Maryland Democratic U.S. Reps.\nSteny Hoyer, David Trone, Dutch Ruppersberger and Kweisi Mfume. Maryland Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes voted present.\nHouse Republicans overwhelmingly backed the resolution which labels some pro-Palestinian slogans as antisemitic.\n\"More Jews were murdered on October 7th than on any other single day since the Holocaust.\nLet that sink in. We have even seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be absolutely clear: such hate has no place in the halls of Congress nor our national discourse. It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and Members of Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and discrimination against the Jewish community,\" said U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tennessee, one of the main sponsors of the resolution.\nGOP backers of the measure point to a rise in antisemitic incidents and pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian rhetoric that calls for or insinuates the destruction of Israel. They also point to the 106 no or present that did not support the measure - 105 of them from Democrat.\n\"The world has seen a drastic rise of antisemitism since October 7th that is deeply disheartening and extremely concerning,\" said U.S. Max Miller, R-Ohio. \"Elected leaders must have the courage to condemn and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism.\nWhile I am glad this resolution passed the House today, I am disappointed that 106 of my colleagues failed to take this opportunity to condemn antisemitism forcefully.\" AMERICA DIVIDED The Gallup poll released Nov. 30 shows significant splits over the Holy Land war by race, political party and gender.\nThe polls shows 71% of Republicans back Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza versus support from 36% of Democrats.\nFifty nine percent of men approve of Israel's war in Gaza versus 44% of women, according the Gallup Among people of color, 64% disapprove of Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza while 61% of whites backs Netanyahu's efforts to dismantle the militant group.\nThere is a similar split my age with 67% of younger Americans (ages 18 to 34) disapproving of Israel's war against Hamas and 63% of voters 55 and older backing the Israel Defense Forces' military effort.\nPalestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 17,000 people have died since Holy Land war stared in October Israeli officials say Hamas fighters killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 terror attacks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Noa Mittelman, 15, center, and Maya Talby, 15, right, hold up flyers of people kidnapped by Hamas during a rally and march for Israel, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Wash.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Muslim protesters burn U.S. and Israel national flags during a rally against the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A demonstrator waves a Palestinian flag as Kenyan police officers fire teargas canisters during a protest against Israel and in support of Palestinians, in Nairobi, Kenya Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tickets are $75 per person.\nLocal humane societies are not directly attached to the National Humane Society, making the Humane Society of Charles County 100% reliant on local donations, grants and fundraising, Rayanne Benya, president of the board of directors for the Humane Society of Charles County, said.\nIn 1975, the humane society did not have a building. Instead, people who found an injured animal had to take them home, Anne Gardiner, founder of the Humane Society of Charles County, said. In 1981, the St. Charles County Association of Realtors gave the humane society the land for a shelter and it opened in 1983.\n\"It was tough getting started,\" Gardiner said. \"One time I had [animals] in all three bathrooms and we were wondering what we were going to do.\"\nThe humane society has three sections: the kennel, which houses animals ranging from dogs and cats to guinea pigs, rabbits, lizards, turtles and snakes; the humane education program, which teaches students about animals and environmental science; and the clinic.\n\"Fifty years later, we're still here,\" Benya said. \"We're here because we're supported by the residents of the county … and I think that's something to celebrate.\"\nThe gala will have a silent auction with dog baskets, Gardiner said. Other baskets will have household items. Wine and alcohol will be raffled, and there will also be gift cards for restaurants and businesses.\nLive music will be performed by the \"Original\" Moonlighters and there will be a lipsologist — a person who \"reads\" lip prints — and a cash bar. Food is being donated by the Waldorf Jaycees.\n\"It's just for a great cause,\" Benya said. \"We adopt out anywhere from one to 2,000 animals a year and all those animals need medical care.\"\nUnder the shelter's care, the humane society often has about 150 animals, an amount that can go up to 250 animals during the summer, Benya said.\nThroughout the year, the shelter has around 200 volunteers who help with adoption events, laundry and being around the animals. They also want to build an animal medical facility for emergencies and a larger surgery wing.\n\"When [people] come here and they volunteer, they see the connection … between humans and animals,\" Benya said.\nThe humane society is holding its annual photo contest until Sept. 27, Benya said. People can send a cute photo of their pet that can be featured in a calendar.\nOn Sept. 20, they will have an adoption event at the humane society, Benya said.\nThe nonprofit also has a program called Freedom Friends year round that offers discounts to veterans to adopt animals for animals that have been in the shelter for six months or longer.\n\"It's important that we receive the funding … so we can continue to be here for the county,\" Benya said. \"If we disappear, that's going to be devastating for the animal population.\nFor more information about the Oct. 10 gala or to purchase tickets, go to humanesocietycc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'He made Delaware famous': Native son George Thorogood honored for rock, blues chops\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1114\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n George Thorogood, whose humble beginnings playing at the University of Delaware and at Newark bars led him to worldwide fame as one of rock 'n' roll's icons, returned to Newark last month for a celebration of his decades-long career.The celebration marked the 50th anniversary of Thorogood's first show, held on a small bandstand at UD's Lane Hall dormitory.\nUD presented Thorogood with its highest non-academic honor, the Medal of Distinction, which is given to people who have made significant cultural, humanitarian, scientific or intellectual contributions to society or in their profession. Thorogood is the first entertainer to receive the award.\n\"We celebrate a rock 'n' roll and blues legend whose music has echoed for the last five decades,\" said Bill Lafferty, vice chair of the UD Board of Trustees. \"A native Delawarean and former semi-pro baseball player, George Thorogood isn't just a musician. He's a storyteller whose guitar speaks the language of freedom and grit and maybe a little bit of rebellion, too.\"\nAfter the formal presentation at the Green Mansion Bar on Main Street, officials unveiled a plaque honoring Thorogood near the site of the former Stone Balloon, where he played many shows. The sign designates the alley between the Washington House and Main Street Plaza as \"Thorogood Alley.\"\n\"Thank you for what you've done for Newark, putting us on the rock 'n' roll map, and what you've done concurrently for the University of Delaware,\" Mayor Jerry Clifton said. \"We can't say thank you enough for the contributions that you have made.\"\nThorogood accepted the honors with self-deprecating humor.\n\"It really proves something I always knew, and that is Delaware always had questionable taste,\" Thorogood quipped.\nHe added that he and bandmates Jeff Simon and Bill Blough were surprised to be invited to such a prestigious event.\n\"Jeff and Bill and I are taken aback because of all the places we weren't invited to, and all the places we were invited to leave,\" he joked. \"So this is more than an honor, it's a shock.\"\nRock 'n' roll history\nA native of Wilmington, Thorogood spent his early 20s traveling the country as an acoustic street musician. When he returned home for his sister's wedding in December 1973, Simon booked the Lane Hall gig without telling him. The two had grown up playing music together informally but had never played an official show.\nThorogood bought an electric guitar at a pawn shop, and the rest was history.\n\"We had the place rockin',\" Thorogood recalled in a biography posted on his website. \"We must have played 'One Bourbon' three times. It may have been a bit unpolished and primitive, but we were connecting with the audience in a major way. From that very first show, Jeff and I knew we were onto something.\"\nAfter that show, George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers began playing gigs at Newark venues like the Stone Balloon, Deer Park Tavern and the Rathskeller, the UD-run beer hall that is now a study room in the Trabant University Center. They then expanded their reach regionally and nationally.\nThe band's major recording debut came in 1977 with the release of a self-titled album.\nThorogood's popularity increased in the 1980s, when the band opened for the Rolling Stones, appeared on Saturday Night Live and devised an aggressive touring schedule that included performances in all 50 states within 50 days.\nHis single \"Bad to the Bone,\" which remains his most well-known song, debuted in 1982. Other hits include \"I Drink Alone\" and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch and One Beer.\"\nIn the '80s, he owned a house on West Chestnut Hill Road in Newark.\nIn 1983, while at the height of his popularity, he returned to Lane Hall to perform a surprise concert in front of 500 people to mark the band's 10th anniversary.\nThorogood and the Destroyers are now in the midst of a tour celebrating their 50th anniversary, which was delayed by a year due to Thorogood's health issues. One day after the ceremony in Newark, they are scheduled to perform at the Freeman Arts Pavilion in Selbyville.\nThorogood's contribution to Newark didn't stop at music. In the late 1970s, he built a baseball field at the corner of Casho Mill Road and Barksdale Road because the city was lacking space to play the sport. A few years later, he sold the field to the city, which renamed it Leroy Hill Park. The field is now used by Newark American Little League and Newark Charter School.\n'He did a lot of good for the city'\nMelissa Forsythe, owner of Rainbow Records, came to Friday's event with several of Thorogood's albums for him to autograph. The rocker's music continues to sell well at Rainbow, she said.\nHis impact goes even farther than that, she added.\n\"He's given people the reality check that it's possible to be from Delaware and do something cool,\" she said.\nDemitri Theodoropoulos remembers being 11 or 12 years old, playing baseball on the field Thorogood built.\n\"Every once in a while, he would show up and almost coach us,\" Theodoropoulos said, adding that he didn't realize at the time who he was. \"We had no idea; he was just this guy who showed up.\"\nAs the owner of Wonderland Records, Theodoropoulos certainly knows who Thorogood is now.\n\"That blues-rock crossover, that's kind of where he is,\" he said. \"He's not full-on blues, and he's not pop rock. He's one of the very few crossover musicians. A lot of people learned to play guitar to his albums.\"\nDave Mackenzie, the longtime engineer at the campus radio station WVUD, said Thorogood played several on-air shows to help the station when it was in its early years. He also remembered working sound for one of Thorogood's Deer Park shows in 1978.\n\"It was New Year's Eve, downstairs in the back room,\" Mackenzie said. \"It was loud, and the train came through every now and then. It was a fun night.\"\nBill Stevenson, who ran the legendary Stone Balloon, recalled that when Thorogood was starting out as a solo musician, he wasn't old enough to get into the music venue.\n\"He used to sit out in front on the wall, play his guitar with the guitar case open and make as much as the musicians made,\" Stevenson said.\nWithin a few years, though, Thorogood became a mainstay at the Balloon, playing some 50 shows there.\n\"He made Delaware famous,\" Stevenson said. \"Everyone in the world knows who George Thorogood is. He did a lot of good for the city.\"\nThe fact that Thorogood was a regular at the Balloon helped Stevenson book other prominent acts.\n\"He brought a lot of credibility to the town,\" Stevenson said. \"We had Bruce Springsteen, Metallica. I couldn't have done it without him being from here. I would keep telling everyone back in the '70s and '80s, 'Well, George plays here all the time.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "National Museum of Asian Art presents 'Park Chan-kyong: Gathering'\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 931\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Seoul-based artist Park Chankyong has gained international recognition for his use of photography and film to examine the complex history of modern Korea.\"Park Chan-kyong: Gathering\" will be the first solo presentation of his work in a major U.S. museum.The exhibition will feature a range of works that highlight Park's masterful use of the photographic medium to explore the enduring traces of tradition, history and disaster in contemporary society. It will be on view at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art Oct. 7 through Oct. 13, 2024.This will be the inaugural exhibition in the National Museum of Asian Art's modern and contemporary galleries, opening as the museum celebrates its centennial year. The galleries will become a space dedicated to engaging visitors in the myriad formats and media employed by artists to examine Asian society from the late-20th century to today, in context with Asian art dating from antiquity to the present that is on view throughout the museum.Park's multi-channel video, \"Citizen's Forest,\" will anchor this exhibition of five recent works. A panoramic video presented in the format of a monumental landscape scroll painting, \"Citizen's Forest\" draws on the poetry of Kim Su-yeong (1921-68), Minjung painting and folk culture to reflect on major tragedies in South Korea's history from the late 19th century to the present. In \"Belated Bosal\" and \"Fukushima: Autoradiography,\" inverted images and the natural landscape convey the inescapable sense of ecological disaster.Another installment in Park's study of the history of North and South Koreas, a series of still and moving image portraits titled \"Child Soldier\" reimagines the presence of a lonely North Korean soldier.In-gallery public programs with the artist and guest speakers will accompany the exhibition, including a screening of a short film by Park and an artist-led discussion Oct. 22 (details below).The exhibition is an important opportunity to introduce visitors to a major figure in contemporary Asian art and engage them in multisensorial experiences and insights into modern and contemporary Korea.Park studied fine arts at Seoul National University and earned a Master of Fine Arts at the California Institute of the Arts. Weaving together art historical and literary references, along with folk traditions and current events, he creates visually powerful works grounded in the enduring impact of rapid socioeconomic development and the Cold War on South Korean politics and society.\"As the National Museum of Asian Art enters its next 100 years at the dawn of what is fast becoming the Asian century, we are even more committed to telling complex stories about objects from a variety of perspectives,\" said the museum's director Chase F. Robinson. \"We are also dedicated to engaging new audiences with Asian arts, cultures and societies and using our platform to address present-day issues.The rich dialogue and learning engendered by contemporary exhibitions like Park Chan-kyong's enable us to reach these goals.\" \"I have followed Park Chan-kyong's work for years and am grateful to him for collaborating with us on this exciting project,\" said Carol Huh, associate curator of contemporary Asian art. \"The opportunity to learn more about his use of the photographic medium and powerfully nuanced insights into Korean society today is an ideal way to usher in the next landmark chapter in the museum's groundbreaking contemporary Asian art program.As the museum embarks on its second century, this exhibition deepens our mission to examine evolving perspectives on the histories and cultures of Asia.\" Following \"Park Chan-kyong: Gathering,\" the museum's new modern and contemporary galleries will feature an exhibition of works by contemporary artist Munem Wasif (Bangladesh), opening in late 2024. Both exhibitions will treat the artists' practices and relevant artistic and social context in greater depth, offering alternative viewpoints on their respective homelands.PROGRAMIn conjunction with \"Gathering,\" Park will come to the National Museum of Asian Art to screen his short film Night Fishing and to discuss his work on Sunday, Oct. 22, at 2 p.m. in the Meyer Auditorium Shot entirely on an iPhone, this surreal short was co-directed by Park and his brother, Park Chanwook, and won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.In it, a fisherman feels a tug on his line, and much to his surprise, pulls a woman (K-pop star Lee Junghyun) out of the water. She comes alive and is revealed to be a shaman priestess who performs a ritual in honor of a drowned man. Like \"Citizen's Forest,\" a video work on view in the exhibition, Night Fishing was inspired by Park's fascination with Korean shamanism.(Dir.: PARKING CHANCE [Park Chan-wook and Park Chankyong], Korea, Korea, 2011, 33 min., DCP, Korean with English subtitles) ABOUT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ASIAN ARTThe Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is committed to preserving, exhibiting, researching and interpreting art in ways that deepen our collective understanding of Asia and the world. Home to more than 46,000 objects, the museum stewards one of North America's largest and most comprehensive collections of Asian art, with works dating from antiquity to the present from China, Japan, Korea, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world. Its rich holdings bring the arts of Asia into direct dialogue with an important collection of 19th-and early 20th-century American works, providing an essential platform for creative collaboration and cultural exchange between the United States, Asia and the Middle East.Its galleries, laboratories, archives and library are located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The museum is free and open to the public 364 days a year (closed Dec. 25).

That can also help bring more transparency to city halls, local law enforcement and school districts.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton.\nBut social media also magnifies broader contemporary distrust of the media, government, politicians and other institutions. It can also bring rumor mills and coarse discourse.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" said Groves Lloyd, mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin (a small town near Madison).\nGroves Lloyd identifies herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small town mayor\" on her X/Twitter account where she is no fan of former president Donald Trump. But the Wisconsin mayor said she's pulled back on her progressive posts, especially on Facebook, because of the atmosphere of social media.\nIn Montana, Nelson, the mayor of Belgrade (which has a population approaching 13,000 people), worries all the political tensions at the local level discourages candidates for office and shortens tenures for staff and officeholders. He avoids social media altogether.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nFor a more expansive look at the issue check out our story online and in our national e-edition on Monday, March 11. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are in our mid 70s and since our childhood we have always vacationed on the Eastern Shore. Twenty years ago we relocated to Northeast, Tennessee, but still annually come back to the Eastern Shore to get our \"seafood and steamed crab fix.\" However, I am writing to you not about your delicious food but about the kindness shown to us by Brent Spurry, owner of the Spurry Tire Company.Our story: We had just finished four glorious days in St. Michaels and while gassing up the car for the 450-mile return trip home, I noticed the valence (or mud guard) located under my front bumper was hanging down. Concerned that it would completely break away while on the highway, I began looking for a repair shop. It was Saturday, and I learned many repair shops were closed. In desperation I asked a kindly person tending our hotel's lawn for help. He directed me to the Spurry Tire Company on Elliot Road. He said be sure to ask for the owner, Brent Spurry.After a 20-minute ride including through picturesque downtown Easton, I arrived at the Spurry Tire Company. It was a larger business than I anticipated with six bays (all full) and maybe a dozen employees (all very busy). The waiting room was also full of customers which I thought didn't bode well for an out-of-state vehicle with a hanging mud-guard being repaired anytime soon.I reluctantly asked to see Brent Spurry and to my surprise he appeared within a minute. I related my story, and he said his bays were full but when one became available someone would take a look. I walked outside to ponder my next move (should I risk the trip home).Just then I heard a pleasant voice say \"We are putting your car in an open bay.Ten minutes later same voice says \"all fixed you're good to go.\" Surprised and grateful I asked, \"What do I owe you?\"[[---]] see the office was the reply. I return to the waiting room (it was even more crowded).\"Hello, I'm Mr. Townsend, you folks were kind to fix my car, what do I owe you?\" Nothing was the reply from the counter clerk. I said obviously this is a busy place but can I see Mr. Spurry?Within minutes Brent Spurry appeared. I thanked him and politely insisted that I pay him for the work.He smiled and said, \"No charge\" [[---]] even though I'm from out-of-state and he will likely never see me again [[---]] He said, \"No charge.\" In a flash he returned to the shop. I turned to leave and said to the crowded waiting room that they were fortunate to have a Spurry Tire Company in their city.A lady remarked for all to hear \"we know.\" I wrote this letter because I wanted others to know about Brent Spurry and his kindness and business practices.He is a perfect example of practicing excellent customer service even to someone from out-of-state.JERRY AND PEGGY TOWNSENDNortheast, Tennessee \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) in a Truth Social post on Aug. 24, saying he may reconsider federal dollars for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge and could \"send in the troops\" to Baltimore.Over 2,000 National Guard troops are deployed in Washington, D.C., with Trump alluding to other potential deployments around the country, including Baltimore.\nOn Aug. 21, Moore wrote a letter to Trump, inviting him to Maryland to see the progress on crime that the state has made.\n\"There is no higher priority for me, as the governor of my state, than the safety of my people. This is an issue of both professional and personal significance. I grew up in and around communities left behind by people in power, who sought to weaponize the pain of their constituents through hollow talking points that never changed the reality on the ground,\" Moore wrote in the letter.\nMoore cited recent crime statistics around the state, saying that he is deeply encouraged by the progress he has seen.\n\"Homicides in Maryland are down statewide by 20% since my inauguration two and a half years ago. In the first six months of 2025, the Baltimore Police Department continued to see double-digit reductions in gun violence, including a 22% decrease in homicides and a 19% decrease in non-fatal shootings from the year before,\" Moore wrote. \"If there's anything Maryland has proven over the last two years, it's that we can achieve performance without being performative.\"\nAt the end of the letter, Moore invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in September on a date of the president's choosing.\n\"Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I 'walk the streets of Maryland' with him,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Aug. 24. \"I assume he is talking about out-of-control, crime-ridden, Baltimore?\"\nTrump furthered that he \"would much prefer that [Moore] clean up this crime disaster\" before he comes to the area for a walk.\n\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing. But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum [sic] did in [Los Angeles], I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby D.C., and quickly clean up the crime,\" Trump wrote.\nTrump finished, saying that he gave \"Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge.\"\n\"I will now have to rethink that decision?\" Trump said.\nMoore responded to Trump's post on Truth Social, saying, \"President Bone Spurs will do anything to get out of walking — even if that means spouting off more lies about the progress we're making on public safety in Maryland.\"\nIn an MSNBC interview following the exchange, Moore emphasized that federal bridge funding was authorized by Congress and President Joe Biden, not Trump.\n\"The 100% cost share that is now being done between the state of Maryland and the federal government was not authorized by Donald Trump,\" Moore said. \"It was authorized by Congress, and it was authorized by President Biden.\n\"Once again, the president's showing this is not about policy. This is not about supporting your people. This is not about what it is going to do to port workers and small businesses. This is an ideology, and it's a deeply dangerous ideology. Frankly, again, [the funding] he's talking about pulling that he did not give us in the first place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Time for DeSantis to rock and roll with Trump - COMMENTARY\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's certainly about time for Ron DeSantis, who remains the main challenger to front-runner Donald Trump, to stop pulling his punches.On the campaign trail this week, responding to the latest indictment, DeSantis came closer than usual. In answer to a reporter's question, he actually acknowledged, \"All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true.\" In other words, they were false.In other words, the election was not stolen.How long will it take for him to come right out and say that?.And if the election wasn't stolen, what does that say about the effort to overturn it?.Storming the Capitol to overturn an election that wasn't stolen? What do you say about that? Based on \"theories that were put out (that) did not prove to be true.\" What is striking about DeSantis' move, however modest, is that it came on the same day as a new poll showing the race in Iowa to be closer than the nationwide contest, with DeSantis running second at 20% to Trump's 44%, still a double-digit lead but less commanding than in the national polls, where Trump enjoys majority support.This is according to the New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Iowa caucus participants. It suggests that DeSantis' efforts in Iowa are having at least some impact.Will he be willing to take on Trump's \"theories\" that did not \"prove to be true\" in the days ahead and actually hold him responsible for spreading lies?.And will that help him or hurt him with the voters, some of whom are currently leaning toward Trump, who he needs to persuade to win the Iowa caucus?.Obviously, from the care and the baby steps he has been taking, it is a difficult strategic dance for the Florida governor. He needs to win the support of Trump backers without losing his credibility entirely in the process.Of course the election was not stolen. Of course the claims of fraud were not true. The fact that we are even playing these games is a bit ridiculous in and of itself.But this is the dance for the nomination. Does it escape mention that Chris Christie, who has been the most outspoken of the Republican candidates in his criticism of Trump, does not break 1% in the Iowa poll?.One point to note from that survey: 67% of Iowa Republicans, when offered a choice, said they preferred a candidate who was focused on \"restoring law and order in our streets and at the border\" than one trained \"on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture,\" which sounds like Trump over DeSantis - or, rather, it sounds like Iowa isn't necessarily buying what DeSantis has been trying to sell.Which raises again the question of what he should be selling: likeability, for certain; electability, for certain; and maybe, as the key component to both of those, traits of character and integrity that used to be the stuff of presidential campaigns, what contests were said to be all about, the measure of the man - exactly the sort of measure that Donald Trump seeks to evade at all costs.When it comes right down to it, the question about election fraud is a question about integrity, and there is only one answer. The answer is integrity, and that is, ultimately, what DeSantis needs to demonstrate, and what he needs to sell. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When Queen Anne-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Department and surrounding fire departments arrived, they discovered a double-wide manufactured home engulfed in flames. Initial reports indicated that two occupants were unaccounted for. After extinguishing the fire, firefighters located the remains of two deceased victims.\nThe victims have been tentatively identified as Margarete Brown, 83, and her son, Larry Brown, 63. According to reports from the State Fire Marshal's office, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) will conduct a formal identification and investigation into the cause and manner of death.\nWhile the cause of the fire remains under investigation, family members told investigators that the victims had purchased a kerosene heater yesterday to replace an older unit. Deputy state fire marshals uncovered seven kerosene heaters among the debris during the investigation. It is unknown at this time how many of those were in use and functioning.\n\"Our hearts break for the families affected by this tragedy,\" said Acting State Fire Marshal Jason M. Mowbray. \"While the cause of this fire remains under investigation, tragedies like this remind us of the importance of fire safety, especially during the winter when the risks increase. I ask everyone to remain vigilant as we light our homes to stay warm. Please check your smoke alarms, have an exit plan and practice it, and get out, stay out,\" Mowbray continued.\nWhenever a fatal fire occurs, a joint investigation between the police agency having jurisdiction, the Office of the State Fire Marshal, and an accelerant detection canine team is standard operating procedure.\n\"Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences are with the victims, their families, and loved ones affected by today's tragic accident,\" shared the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The group requested funding to launch a Violence Prevention Initiative course within the school system for students, parents, guardians, teachers and staff.\n\"For this to be successful in our community, or in any community, it has to be a multi-tiered approach because you can't teach one sector without teaching the other when they're all working together,\" Redmer said at the meeting.\nRedmer said the pilot program hosted at North Dorchester High School garnered great student feedback. School officials, Redmer and Whitelock are prepared to start the courses in September but are currently being held back by financial constraints.\nThis comes at a time when Dorchester County Public Schools are already struggling financially, having dealt with a $10.19 million deficit in January that forced the county to make hard decisions like cutting after-school and summer programs.\n\"We are in the process of searching for more funders to assist with this program,\" Thompson wrote. \"We are looking for multiple funding streams, including grants, philanthropists and other organizations.\"\nWhitelock said private investors and foundations can make tax-deductible donations through Redmer's nonprofit, Someone to Walk With.\nWhitelock, who wrote a book on violence prevention last year, said they will begin the courses in Dorchester County starting in September regardless of their fiscal status.\nCurrently, the program focuses on Cambridge-South Dorchester High School and Mace's Lane Middle School, where the majority of the suspensions from the previous year came from.\nThe goals of the program are to reduce youth violence and behavioral disruptions; to strengthen communication, problem solving and conflict resolution; and to build collaboration among schools, communities and corrections.\n\"One of the biggest concepts of the book is that violence is just a way people communicate,\" Whitelock said.\nFor Whitelock, prevention-focused education and training, rather than response-oriented approaches, are necessary. He said it is important that the burden is not all on the students.\n\"We want parents to go through the course as well, because we want you to know what we're teaching your kids, and we want you to be involved and helping to emphasize positive habits and positive reinforcement,\" Whitelock said.\nWhitelock, Thompson and Redmer want the initiative to extend outside of the schools as well, emphasizing the importance of a community approach. Redmer described this as \"the termite takeover\" approach: slow but effective.\n\"Cambridge faces some of the same issues found in larger metropolitan areas that impact the school setting,\" Thompson wrote. \"That is why this must be a collective effort involving the entire community to help reduce the violence that affects our schools.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many stopped to watch the process, one woman insistent on carrying off a piece of the tree, others taking photos from the street.\nAccording to Queen Anne's County Public Works Department Chief of Engineering Lee Edgar, the courthouse elm tree displayed visual signs of distress last summer, including a wilting canopy and browning leaves.\nDespite the best efforts of the Public Works Department and the assistance of local and specialized arborists to diagnose and promptly treat the tree, assessments indicated it was stricken with Dutch Elm Disease, an intrinsic infection that attacks a tree's vascular system, Edgar said.\n\"We certainly gave it our best shot,\" he said.\nThe courthouse elm had previously been thought to have been of a variety resistant to fungal infections.\n\"And that was not the case,\" he said.\nThe tree is a field elm, and by best estimates was approximately 120 years old. The tree at the time of removal was about five and one-half feet in diameter and estimated to be about sixty feet tall.\n\"The loss certainly came as a sad day for us,\" Edgar said.\nQueen Anne's County is currently reviewing qualifications from tree experts to remove the elm.\nLocal sawmill Wood Ingenuity LLC of Queen Anne specializes in handling large sections of wood and has been tasked with milling.\n\"We're going to make the most of it,\" Edgar said.\nThe county is exploring ways to best repurpose the wood into the historic courthouse under renovation, including potential aspects such as plaques, gavels and furniture, he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — This was setting up like so many other past unhappy endings for North Dorchester High's boys basketball team.The Eagles had held the lead for the bulk of the first half, only to falter when the opposition rallied to take the lead after halftime.\nSt. Michaels was pretty much following that script Monday night, erasing a first-half deficit on the way to building a modest six-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. But North Dorchester pieced together a comeback of its own, outscoring the Saints 15-6 in the final period for a 50-49 victory that ended its three-game slide.\n\"We're lucky to get out of here with a win,\" said Eagles head coach Robert Smith Jr., his team now 2-3 overall, 1-3 North Bayside. \"There was a time where we would of settled in and been like, 'Oh, this is over.' But they didn't stop fighting. They never quit, and good things will come if they keep playing like that.\"\nSt. Michaels (2-4, 2-3) — which dressed only seven players after eight were suspended for leaving the bench during an altercation with Kent County on Dec. 19 — trailed 15-9 after the first quarter, then outscored North Dorchester, 34-22, over the next two quarters to carry a 43-37 lead into the fourth.\nBut the Saints went cold from the floor over the final 8 minutes while the Eagles steadily chipped away at their deficit.\nVictor Merrit began the rally when he made one of two free-throw attempts, then scored on a layup, drawing the visitors within three. Tahjere Pritchett (eight points) tied the game at 43-all with 5 minutes, 46 seconds remaining. North Dorchester, which converted just 7 of 24 attempts from the foul line, had chance to take the lead less than 30 seconds later, but Merrit missed a pair of free throws.\nSt. Michaels regained the lead at 45-43, when Johnny Mautz (game-high 20 points) scored on a drive with 5:09 remaining.\nThe Eagles answered, with Jazeon Cephas hitting a jumper with 4:30 to go, and Pritchett scoring a layup 20 seconds later for a 47-45 lead.\nBoth teams missed a pair of foul shots before North Dorchester's Alvin Hutton (team-high 18 points) made the second of two attempts with 2:49 left, nudging the Eagles' lead to 48-45.\nMautz scored on a follow 14 seconds later, was fouled, but couldn't complete the three-point play. Hutton, who buried five first-half 3-pointers, grabbed the ball and raced coast to coast for a layup before getting fouled. Hutton missed the free throw, but had provided what proved to be the game-winning bucket with 2:25 remaining for a 50-47 Eagles lead.\n\"Nothing is easy in the Bayside,\" Smith said. \"It was one of them games where it could have gone either way. We were back and forth, back and forth. But I give our guys credit because they fought.\"\nThe drama wasn't quite over though.\nMautz made a left-handed shot with 1:35 remaining to pull St. Michaels within 50-49. Pritchett was fouled on a 3-point attempt, but could not lengthen North Dorchester's lead from the foul line\nSt. Michaels had chances over the final minute, with Connor Wheeler (eight points) watching a shot spin around and off the rim, and Mautz missing on a pair of putback attempts.\n\"It came down to a couple of possessions late in the game going back and forth,\" Saints head coach Kentrell \"Boo\" Ricketts said. \"I thought we got a real good look at the basket at the end when we were down one. It just happened to not go in.\n\"We missed a lot of shots that usually go down for us,\" Ricketts added. \"Some times I think we were taking quick shots and forcing the issue. I keep telling my guys, 'Some times we're beating ourselves. It's not necessarily these teams beating us.' But hat's off to North Dorchester for finishing out. They hit a lot of key shots. They had the one kid (Hutton who) shot the ball very well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Must have seven-foot clearance on sidewalks or 12-foot clearance on streets.Immediately removing animal excrement from sidewalks, streets, parks or other public places unless physically unable.Maintaining the water service line from the curb stop to the building.Maintaining plumbing inside meter pits and within the building.Installing and maintaining a Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) if required.Keeping the water pit visible and maintaining plumbing inside it.Keeping weeds, grass, and vegetation under 6 inches.Keeping property free of litter, refuse, and unsightly growth.\nThe city is responsible for the following:\nMaintaining, repairing, operating public sewer mains under streets and public areas.Repairing and maintaining curbs, gutters, streets.Maintaining water mains.Maintaining service line up to curb stop.If a water meter is in an outdoor pit the city owns and maintains the meter and the pit.\nThe utility companies are responsible for the following:\nMaintaining meters and transformers on property that are part of the utility system.Servicing lines from pole to weatherhead.Maintaining all equipment and piping up to and including the gas meter. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arms had just arrived back from patrolling with the infantry outside the city for multiple days. On these patrols, you could forget about hot water, phones and internet. There were no \"creature comforts,\" as Detmer put it.\n\"It was a dirty and miserable place,\" he said. \"And that was not considering the danger that was connected to it.\"\nDetmer watched Arms enter the room that day and look toward the large and overflowing plywood trashcan.\n\"That trashcan would get heaped up,\" Detmer said. \"And it would usually take a sergeant or an angry corporal coming in there and fussing at somebody to take it out and put it in the trashcan outside.\"\nDetmer can remember Arms, who had just returned from that \"dirty and miserable\" patrol rotation, setting his things down and going over to take out the trash; Assuming responsibility for something he hadn't contributed to.\n\"Not one piece of that trash in that trashcan came from Brad Arms,\" Detmer said. \"Brad Arms was out in hardship and danger that whole time that trashcan had filled up.\"\nArms, who was later killed while serving in Iraq, was one of the five fallen heroes that Detmer spoke about at a Memorial Day service hosted by American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge on Monday, May 27. Detmer also spoke about two other friends, Andy Aviles and Jesse Strong, and two Dorchester natives, Cecil \"Butch\" Jenkins from Taylors Island and Adam Mooney from Cambridge.\nIn sharing each of their stories, Detmer pointed out the similarities of the five men. They were bright and well-regarded in their communities. \"The cream of the crop,\" he said.\nAlong with that, as illustrated in Detmer's story about Arms, these men were not selfish.\n\"They were also people who I don't believe — even knowing (the) price that they were eventually called to pay — I don't think they would have shirked it,\" he said.\nAt the American Legion on Memorial Day, prayer and song were a part of the service dedicated to those who gave their lives serving in the military. Former state senator and Post 91 Historian Richard Colburn told attendees they could \"certainly\" grill hotdogs and crack open a beer in the afternoon.\n\"But to honor those that gave us supreme sacrifice is the most important thing we can do on Memorial Day,\" he said.\nAt the service, Dorchester County Orphans Court Judge Rev. George Ames gave an invocation, the City of Cambridge Color Guard presented arms, Amy Bennett sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"God Bless America,\" Sheila Hickman read the poem \"In Flanders Fields,\" Cole Kesselring played the bagpipes and Pastor Steve Bloodsworth gave a benediction.\nAt noon, the firing of a cannon indicated the American flag had been raised from half-mast, in honor of Memorial Day, and \"Taps\" was played.\nIn his speech, Detmer said that it is important to honor and memorialize fallen heroes through holding these events, creating physical monuments dedicated to them and telling their stories.\n\"Understand that these sons and daughters of these families, they were our friends and neighbors too,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of these items are to be completed to match the approved permit and site plan.\nWahl said Underwood and Associates is required to complete this phase of the project by April 19.\nIn December, the Commissioners of Oxford announced that although the Strand Beach project was signed off on in June by previous Town Manager Cheryl Lewis, the project had not been completed to the specifications that Underwood and Associates had originally presented.\nThe plan for the project was to create a berm, place hooks along the east and west areas of the Strand to bring in sand, create small islands in the water to reduce waves coming onto the beach and plant low marsh grasses on those islands. During the commissioners meeting in December, Commissioner Katrina Greer said not all the grasses had been planted on the islands and the islands were two feet higher in elevation than they were supposed to be.\nThat month, Greer brought together the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Underwood and Associates and the organizations that funded the project to ensure Underwood and Associates would bring down the elevation of the islands and take out the sand that goes out to the headlands at no cost to the town. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Corporate tax breaks end up costing schools\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE CONVERSATION | Section: National \n \n 1063\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Built in 1910, James Elementary is a three-story brick school in Kansas City, Missouri's historic Northeast neighborhood, with a bright blue front door framed by a sand-colored stone arch adorned with a gargoyle.As bustling students and teachers negotiate a maze of gray stairs with worn wooden handrails, Marjorie Mayes, the school's principal, escorts a visitor across uneven blue tile floors on the ground floor to a classroom with exposed brick walls and pipes. Bubbling paint mars some walls, evidence of the water leaks spreading inside the aging building.\n\"It's living history,\" said Mayes during a mid-September tour of the building. \"Not the kind of living history we want.\"\nThe district would like to tackle the $400 million in deferred maintenance needed to create a 21st century learning environment at its 35 schools — including James Elementary — but it can't. It doesn't have the money.\nPROPERTY TAX REDIRECT\nThe lack of funds is a direct result of the property tax breaks that Kansas City lavishes on companies and developers that do business there. The program is supposed to bring in new jobs and business but instead has ended up draining civic coffers and starving schools. Between 2017 and 2023, the Kansas City school district lost $237.3 million through tax abatements.\nKansas City is hardly an anomaly. An estimated 95% of U.S. cities provide economic development tax incentives to woo corporate investors. The upshot is that billions have been diverted from large urban school districts and from a growing number of small suburban and rural districts. The impact is seen in districts as diverse as Chicago and Cleveland, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Storey County, Nevada.\nThe result? A 2021 review of 2,498 financial statements from school districts across 27 states revealed that, in 2019 alone, at least $2.4 billion was diverted to fund tax incentives. Yet that substantial figure still downplays the magnitude of the problem, because three-quarters of the 10,370 districts analyzed did not provide any information on tax abatement agreements.\nTax abatement programs have long been controversial, pitting states and communities against one another in beggar-thy-neighbor contests. Their economic value is also, at best, unclear: Studies show most companies would have made the same location decision without taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, schools make up the largest cost item in these communities, meaning they suffer most when companies are granted breaks in property taxes.\nA three-month investigation by The Conversation and three scholars with expertise in economic development, tax laws and education policy shows that the cash drain from these programs is not equally shared by schools in the same communities. At the local level, tax abatements and exemptions often come at the cost of critical funding for school districts that students from low-income households and who are racial minorities.\nIn Missouri, for example, in 2022 nearly $1,700 per student was redirected from Kansas City public and charter schools, while between $500 and $900 was redirected from wealthier, whiter Northland schools on the north side of the river in Kansas City and in the suburbs beyond. Other studies have found similar demographic trends elsewhere, including New York state, South Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nThe funding gaps produced by abated money often force schools to delay needed maintenance, increase class sizes, lay off teachers and support staff and even close outright. Schools also struggle to update or replace outdated technology, books and other educational resources. And, amid a nationwide teacher shortage, schools under financial pressures sometimes turn to inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or rely too heavily on recruits from overseas who have been given special visa status.\nLost funding also prevents teachers and staff, who often feed, clothe and otherwise go above and beyond to help students in need, from earning a living wage. All told, tax abatements can end up harming a community's value, with constant funding shortfalls creating a cycle of decline.\nINCENTIVES AND PAYOFFS\nPerversely, some of the largest beneficiaries of tax abatements are the politicians who publicly boast of handing out the breaks despite the harm to poorer communities. Incumbent governors have used the incentives as a means of taking credit for job creation, even when the jobs were coming anyway.\n\"We know that subsidies don't work,\" said Elizabeth Marcello, a doctoral lecturer at Hunter College who studies governmental planning and policy and the interactions between state and local governments. \"But they are good political stories, and I think that's why politicians love them so much.\"\nWhile some voters may celebrate abatements, parents can recognize the disparities between school districts that are created by the tax breaks. Fairleigh Jackson pointed out that her daughter's East Baton Rouge third grade class lacks access to playground equipment.\nThe class is attending school in a temporary building while their elementary school undergoes a two-year renovation.\nThe temporary site has some grass and a cement slab where kids can play, but no playground equipment, Jackson said. And parents needed to set up an Amazon wish list to purchase basic equipment such as balls, jump ropes and chalk for students to use. The district told parents there would be no playground equipment due to a lack of funds, then promised to install equipment, Jackson said, but months later, there is none.\nJackson said it's hard to complain when other schools in the district don't even have needed security measures in place. \"When I think about playground equipment, I think that's a necessary piece of child development,\" Jackson said. \"Do we even advocate for something that should be a daily part of our kids' experience when kids' safety isn't being funded?\"\nA young student in the East Baton Rouge district told the school board that money going to tax breaks for corporations could provide better internet access or be used to hire someone to pick up the glass and barbed wire in the playground. But at least they have a playground — Hayden Crockett, a seventh grader at Sherwood Middle Academic Magnet School, noted that his sister's elementary school lacked one.\n\"If it wasn't in the budget to fund playground equipment, how can it also be in the budget to give one of the most powerful corporations in the world a tax break?\" Crockett said. \"The math just ain't mathing.\"\nThis article was written by Christine Wen, Texas A&M University; Danielle McLean, The Conversation; Kevin Welner, University of Colorado Boulder; and Nathan Jensen, The University of Texas at Austin.

    "content": "Dixon days: Daryl dominates new 'Walking Dead' series\n\n September 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 433\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Premiering Sunday, Sept. 10, on AMC and AMC+, \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" sees the return of Norman Reedus (\"The Boondock Saints,\" 1999) as on-screen anti-hero Daryl Dixon.Created by David Zabel (\"ER\"), \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" is the fifth spinoff from the flagship series, hereafter referred to as TWD, and takes place after TWD's 11 seasons of horror. And while viewers have already gathered their fair share of Daryl details since his first appearance in TWD's Season 1 episode \"Tell It to the Frogs,\" audiences have never seen the troubled \"walker\"-fighting hero quite like this.\"Daryl Dixon\" follows the titular character as he \"washes ashore in France and struggles to piece together how he got there and why\" (per AMC). According to the official synopsis, \"The series tracks his journey across a broken but resilient France as he hopes to find a way back home,\" noting that as \"he makes the journey the connections he forms along the way complicate his ultimate plan.\" The title of this latest TWD spinoff was announced in October 2022, which is also when filming began in Paris. Despite AMC's initial desire to produce a series that followed another TWD character, Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride, \"The Mist,\" 2007), the network eventually landed on \"Daryl Dixon\" as a result of scheduling conflicts with McBride. That said, McBride is expected to reprise her role as Carol in at least one of the premiere season's six episodes.In fact, as mentioned by Vanity Fair writer Derek Lawrence in his November 2022 article titled \"Norman Reedus Unpacks the Walking Dead Finale and His 'F-ing Great' Spin-Off,\" Daryl himself made a nod toward his own future series in the final episodes of the flagship series' finale.\"It's not like we're never gonna see each other again,\" Daryl tells Carol in an intimate scene toward the end of 'Rest in Peace,'\" Lawrence writes, noting Carol's response: \"I'm allowed to be a little sad. You're my best friend.\" And while we have no idea what may be in store for Carol, fans can certainly expect more \"Daryl Dixon\" beyond the first six episodes. Just last month, AMC announced that the series had already been renewed for a second season.Also joining the cast for Season 1 is French actress Clémence Poésy, known for her roles in films such as the Harry Potter franchise (beginning in 2005), \"In Bruges\" (2008) and \"Tenet\" (2020), among others.Poésy plays Isabelle, a French woman with a dark Parisian past and a connection to a \"progressive religious group.\" She joins forces with Daryl on his journey. \n \n Caption: Louis Puech Scigliuzzi and Norman Reedus in \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Caroline County Recreation and Parks hosted the 25th annual Rivah Run. There was even a beagle on board a kayak with a little life jacket.\"This is actually the 25th year of Rivah Run. So, we have nice silver anniversary lettering on the T-shirts.It has been a blast. We had to cap our launch at 100.We didn't want to clog up the boat ramp all day at the yacht club, so we capped it at 100, but we have gotten up to 150 in the past couple of years,\" said Danny Mitchell, Recreation and Parks program and community services manager.He went on to contextualize the event in this packed summer weekend.\"I think the point is to add a little bit of calmness before the second night of Summerfest. You come out, appreciate, have a great time on the water and kind of take a breath and enjoy nature before the second night of the festival,\" he said.There is a gambler's rush within all this paddling. It is more of a card game than a race.\"They will pick up five cards between the start and when they come back for the finish. It is station to station, not like a timed race.The best five card poker hand wins. It is all kind of whether lady luck is smiling on you or not,\" he said.Tory Lydy, in a red and yellow kayak, said, \"I am expecting to win! I have high expectations. No, I am just up for having a nice time on the water. Spend time with friends, meet people.I am originally from Illinois.I just moved here.\" Ariana Munoz showed her bag full of a T-shirt, stickers, brochures and one playing card - the seven of clubs. There were dozens of vessels launched and floating in the river. One kayak had two occupants, the paddler and Grisby the beagle, who is the Caroline County reading dog.This is his seventh year.\"I keep coming back because it is a fun day to spend with my dog,\" said Diana Laclair of Denton.Mitchell started with a PA system and a microphone, but resorted to loud projection when the system failed.\"You are going to get a second card at that boat. Keep going past the railroad bridge. When you pass it, it is the one mile marker. So you are going to turn back and head for home. When you come back you are going to get another card from that same boat. That is your third card. You get your fourth card back at the boat ramp. You get the fifth card back with me at the prize check,\" he said.On the Caroline County Recreation and Parks website it says, \"Best five card poker hand gets first pick of prize options with a cash value of $750 for each run.\" Joseph Wrobel was the grand prize winner with an aces high flush. There were five flushes total.As it was the special 25th year, they increased the pool to $1,500 and added some nicer things to win.Shore Rivers was a sponsor and had a safety boat on the water.Dick's Sporting Goods also was a sponsor as was Eastern Shore Cycle and Sport.Bottom line, it was a beautiful day to be out on the river. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/TIMES-RECORD\n \nOn a special high rise kayak that can double as a paddleboard are the Degners.

Tourists flocked with their dogs to get a look at the creative process.\nNeil Hughes, an artists from Medford, New Jersey, said he prefers having more time to work on his paintings but that \"it's a great event, hard not to have fun.\"\nKaitlyn Hay an artist form Washington, D.C., said the event gave her the opportunity to appreciate work by many of the event's talented participants. \"The quick draw is so fun. You just get into the zone. I am certainly nowhere near the level of some of these fellow painters, but it is just fun to participate.\"\nOne of the youngest painters at the event was 7-year-old Isabel Tilley. \"I have been painting basically all my life,\" she said. \"I painted a cream-colored fence. I am inspired by art.\"\nNot only were there a lot of easels and paints moving around downtown, but there were art lovers waiting to find pieces that spoke to them.\n\"I have come for probably 15 years, and for 10 of those years, I have bought something,\" said Stephanie Saunders. \"I usually come to the Quick Draw and see what is around.\"\nNancy Tankersley, the judge of the Quick Draw event, cruised through the work with a clipboard, looking for the best.\nThere were many volunteers moving art, handing out water and keeping time.\nNancy Espenhorst, a volunteer, said, \"I have numerous jobs. I drive a golf cart. I sell art. I am at the information table, and I blow the horn. I like to stay active, and you get to see lots of people.\"\nThe event is organized by the Avalon Foundation.\nBill Witowski, the Avalon Foundation's chair, said art sales from the Quick Draw and other Plein Air events support the organization's efforts in the community yearound.\n\"Just look how many people have come out. It is just a magic time, and look at all the art sales,\" Witowski said. \"That really helps the foundation, which feeds back into the community.\"\nThe quick draw is an award-driven paint off. Up to $1,500 is in the offering.\n\"There are only nine awards so sorry to those of you who didn't make the final list. I really like a strong sense of place,\" Tankersley said.\nThe grand prize for the quick draw with an invitation to compete in Plein Air Easton 2025 was given to David Orrin Smith from Seattle.\n\"That format of paint something from life in two hours at the scale that I work in, which is 30x42 and watercolor, that is what I do all year long all the time,\" Smith said. He was grateful to all the volunteers who made the event happen. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Moore hopeful of GOP support for Key Bridge clean-up\n\n April 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER and TYRAH BURRIS Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 656\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore said he has met with several Republicans in Congress to discuss federal support for the response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and that they have been \"incredibly encouraging\" about their support for the clean-up effort.He praised the sole Republican in the Maryland delegation in Congress, Rep. Andy Harris, for reaching out to his friends in the conservative Freedom Caucus on behalf of the bridge recovery.\nMoore hasn't officially sat down with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, even though he showed up at Johnson's office on Capitol Hill recently, the governor said in an interview. But he said he has personally met with \"multiple Republican chairs of multiple committees.\"\n\"They've been incredibly encouraging, because they understand that what we're asking for in this moment is not for a favor,\" Moore said. \"We're not asking for a charity. Right? We're asking for support that a crucial artery for the Port of Baltimore can actually get supported.\"\nMoore's comments came during a wide-ranging interview with Capital News Service in his office conference room, where he again called on Congress to take bipartisan action using Maryland as an example.\n\"There's something special that we're doing here in Maryland, where we really are moving in a sense of collaboration and it's not always saying that we agree on everything, we don't,\" Moore said. \"But we move in collaboration, and we move in partnership.\"\nIn the four weeks since a container ship struck the Key Bridge and brought it crashing down, officials have scrambled to handle the crisis. Maryland's Congressional delegation unveiled a bill requiring the federal government to pay for all costs of rebuilding the bridge.\nPresident Joe Biden initially promised full federal funding to rebuild the bridge, with his administration quickly making $60 million available upon a request from the Maryland Department of Transportation. The fate of other funds remains in the hands of Congress.\nAt a time when it is challenging for members of Congress to find common ground, Moore said, he is asking them to remember \"who got hurt in this.\" He's also asking them to maintain a sense of urgency in the response.\nFully clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore have been top priorities for Moore as he continues navigating the crisis. A 35-foot deep channel is set to open later this week, Moore announced Tuesday, so several stranded vessels can safely depart.\nThis channel will only open for a few days and then close as salvage crews work to remove debris perched on the bow of the Dali and stay on track with opening the full channel.\nThe FBI has since opened an investigation into the Dali, but Moore said \"in no way, shape or form\" will it interfere with reopening the channel and the port. The investigation is important, Moore told CNS, and his team is cooperating with FBI and National Transportation Safety Board investigations.\n\"Because if people are held liable, criminally or otherwise, they need to be held to account,\" Moore said. \"Something tragic happened and I think it's important that the FBI, the NTSB and everyone else who's investigating, they find out what and they find out who's responsible.\"\nWhile managing the biggest crisis the state has faced during his tenure, Moore recalled how tough the first few days after the bridge collapse were. He said he was working on only a couple of hours of sleep each day and barely saw his children.\nWhen his family then sat down for their first dinner together, his son, 10, didn't quite understand what was happening. But his 12-year-old daughter, he said, asked him a stream of questions and shared things she'd heard at school.\nMoore said \"this stuff isn't easy\" for his children, but that he's trying to see things through their eyes.\n\"I've really been so impressed with how they just continue to maintain their humanity and their independence, and also their innocence in all of it,\" Moore said. \"Which I think has just been really beautiful.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Congress moves into crisis mode as shutdown looms\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 755\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Congress is rushing headlong into crisis mode Tuesday with a government shutdown days away, as Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces an insurgency from hard-right Republicans eager to slash spending even if it means halting pay for the military and curtailing federal services for millions of Americans.There's no clear path ahead as lawmakers return with tensions high and options limited. The House is expected to launch an evening vote on a package of bills to fund parts of the government, but it's not at all clear that McCarthy has the support needed as holdouts demand steeper spending cuts.\"It's easy,\" McCarthy quipped Tuesday when asked about keeping the government open.But with just five days to go before Saturday's deadline, the Senate is trying to stave off a federal closure as the hard-right flank seizes control of the House. Senators unveiled a bipartisan stopgap measure to keep offices funded for temporarily, through Nov. 17, to buy time for Congress to finish its work.The 79-page Senate bill would fund the government at current levels and include about $6 billion supplemental funding for Ukraine and $6 billion in U.S. disaster assistance that has been in jeopardy. It also includes an extension of Federal Aviation Administration provisions expiring Saturday.Ahead of a test vote Tuesday evening, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the temporary measure from the Senate \"a bridge towards cooperation and away from extremism.\"With a supportive nod, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell appeared on board with the bipartisan Senate plan saying, \"Government shutdowns are bad news.\"A government shutdown would disrupt the U.S. economy and the lives of millions of Americans who work for the government or rely on federal services - from the military personnel and air traffic controllers who would be asked to work without pay to some 7 million people in the Women, Infants and Children program, including half the babies born in the U.S., who could lose access to nutritional benefits, according to the White House.The standoff comes against the backdrop of the 2024 elections as a core group of hard-right Republicans are being egged on by Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner to challenge President Joe Biden, who has urged McCarthy's House to stand firm in the fight or \"shut it down.\"It is setting up a splitscreen later this week as House Republicans hold their first Biden impeachment inquiry hearing probing the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, as Congress spirals closer to a shutdown. It also comes as former Trump officials are floating their own plans to slash government and the federal workforce if the former president retakes the White House.Against the mounting chaos, Biden warned the Republican conservatives off their hard-line tactics, saying funding the federal government is \"one of the most basic fundamental responsibilities of Congress.\"Biden implored the House Republicans not to renege on the debt deal he struck earlier this year with McCarthy, which set the federal government funding levels and was signed into law after approval by both the House and the Senate.\"We made a deal, we shook hands, and said this is what we're going to do. Now, they're reneging on the deal,\" Biden said late Monday.But Trump is pushing Republicans to dismantle the deal with Biden. \"Unless you get everything, shut it down!\" Trump wrote in all capital letters on social media. \"It's time Republicans learned how to fight!\" The Republican speaker McCarthy brushed off Trump's influence as just a negotiating tactic, even as the far-right plan keeps torpedoing his plans.McCarthy arrived at the Capitol after a tumultuous week in which a handful of hard-right Republicans torpedoed his latest plans to advance a usually popular defense funding bill. They brought the chamber to a standstill, and leaders sent lawmakers home for the weekend with no endgame in sight.McCarthy, of California, was hopeful the latest plan on a package of four bills, to fund Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, and State and Foreign Operations, would kickstart the process.At the same time, McCarthy was also reviving his plan for the Republicans to pass their own stopgap measure even though a handful on the hard-right said they would never vote for it, denying him a majority. That proposal would fund the government while also adding severe border security provisions that Biden, Democrats, and even some Republicans reject.\"I'm working all my time to make sure that there would not be a shutdown,\" McCarthy insisted Tuesday. \n \n Caption: Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is surrounded by reporters looking for updates on plans to fund the government and avert a shutdown, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Sept. 22. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm a 2-year-old pit bull and plott hound mix. I go to Egypt Road Regional Park almost every day, and so do a lot of my friends, like Rudder, Ashby, Orwell, Avery, Jet, Rudy and Mattie, Obi, Billie and Murdoch ... I could go on for quite some time because there are a lot of dogs that love Egypt Road Park just like I do, but you get the idea.We were upset when the guys with pickup trucks began tearing up the fields, and we understand fully why you closed the park to traffic. In fact, we think you should leave it that way, because we all know that when the grass is nicely grown and you open the park, the pickup truck gang will be right back to mess it up again.\nSo how about putting a couple of removable bollards at the entrance? When you have a cross country meet, you can remove them so folks can get in and out, and most of the time they can be there.\nAnyone who wants to walk in the park can park across the road where there's plenty of parking, and we'll be so happy to have easy access to our favorite park again.\nWhat do you say?\nRICHARD BEARMAN\nCambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Ahead of the curve’: Maryland realtors not as affected by NAR settlement\n\n September 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A $418 million settlement by the National Association of Realtors has brought forth changes to traditional practices of how broker commissions are paid. Maryland realtors, however, aren't having to adjust as much as their counterparts.The settlement was reached in May after class-action lawsuits by home sellers alleged antitrust violations stemming from requirements placed on listing brokers. The NAR denied any wrongdoing in connection to those claims.\nIn the wake of the settlement, two key changes from the NAR went into effect in August. First, homebuyers must sign a written agreement with an agent before that agent provides any services to the buyer. Second, offers of compensation from a seller to a buyer's agent may no longer be shared on multiple listing services, which are marketplaces for realtors.\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' stance on the changes is that there is now an increased sense of transparency for homebuyers and sellers.\n\"The lawsuit was really about transparency and how (buyer's agents are) getting paid,\" Shelby Roney, board president, said. \"And it kind of makes you reiterate why you should be paid.\"\nRoney, a realtor for Benson & Mangold Real Estate, said Maryland won't be feeling that first change as much as other states. She pointed out that Maryland has had buyer's agency since 1999, noting a law enacted in 2016 that required written buyer agency agreements.\nMaryland realtors representing potential buyers are used to signing those written agreements, detailing to the buyer what services the agent will provide and at what cost. The national rule will reinforce that routine and force buyers and agents to sign agreements that are even clearer in outlining how much commission will cost for the agent.\n\"We've always been very proactive and ahead of the game, ahead of the curve,\" Roney said of Maryland.\nMeanwhile, other states that did not have clear buyer's agency law had to quickly adjust to the new requirements.\n\"They were already freaking out before March,\" Roney said of other states. \"When I was in California, there were agents from all over the country, and most of them did not have anything resembling buyer's agency. And it was very concerning for them, that they were nowhere prepared. How to explain it, how to even enforce it, how to word it, their state laws were going to have to change.\"\nThe increased focus on explicit buyer's agency agreements only furthers the advantages of a buyer paying their own agent rather than relying on a sub-agent during the buying process, Roney said.\nSub-agents are agents unaffiliated from the listing real estate broker but paid by the seller or seller's agent to assist prospective buyers. They do not work for the same company as the seller's agent.\nSub-agency is still alive in the state, according to Roney. However, sub-agents are only able to provide so much help to buyers since their loyalties are only to the seller. For prospective buyers, having a dedicated buyer's agent is beneficial.\n\"It's the biggest investment that you're going to make in your lifetime,\" she said of buying a home. Roney did note that many first-time homebuyers have benefitted from the seller paying the commission for an agent.\nThe option for a seller to offer compensation to a buyer's agent is still available, Roney said, though not through multiple listing service databases. Now, it'll be clear to buyers before any agreement is signed.\nThe benefits of having a buyer's agent are significant for buyers, especially when housing prices rise, the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors says. It'll also help realtors understand their value and be upfront about what \"tier\" of services they will offer depending on the compensation rate.\n\"You have to know your value and you have to explain your value, and you also have to decide what your tiers (of service) are,\" Roney said. \" … Where do you want me to work for you?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GoodLife identified the damaged section of pipe, which was removed and replaced the same evening. The system was returned to full operation shortly thereafter.\nAn estimated 500 gallons of untreated wastewater were discharged, with 1,500 gallons recovered during the response effort, the press release said. The affected yard area was cleaned using vacuum trucks, and lime was applied by the Talbot County collection crew to stabilize and disinfect the impacted ground surface.\nThe event was reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Talbot County Office of Environmental Health.\nAccording to the press release, based on the location of the sewage discharge and the quick response, the discharge did not reach any navigable or shellfish harvesting waters. Environmental Health has determined there is minimal to no public health risk.\nIf the public has any questions regarding the public health determination, they may contact Brennan Greene, director of Environmental Health, at 410-770-6880. For questions regarding the discharge or the corrective action, contact Ray Clarke, county engineer, at 410-770-8170. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Low marsh grasses will be planted on the islands.\nExpected to be completed by summer, the project also includes elevating the lowest-lying areas of Strand Road and improving the parking lot by paving it and building storm management areas underneath it.\nAt the Oxford Town Talk event Wednesday, representatives from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the National Wildlife Federation and the engineering firm Underwood and Associates gave presentations and answered questions. All three of these organizations have partnered with Oxford on the project.\nNicole Carlozo of Maryland DNR, talked about the Resiliency through Restoration initiative. Carlozo said this program, which she manages, helps communities \"become more resilient to climate change\" by providing support for project design and implementation.\nShe said the program focuses on using nature-based solutions to address the impacts of climate change.\nOxford's shoreline improvement project was selected to receive funding for both the design and construction phases through this program. Additional funding for the project has been obtained through a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.\nIn an interview, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said the town is still working to get additional funding for the project from the state.\nAmanda Poskaitis, coastal resilience program manager with the National Wildlife Federation Mid-Atlantic Regional Center, said elevating the lowest lying areas of Strand Road and the parking lot will really help reduce flooding. She said the living shoreline is still in place and \"working pretty well\" following intense storms this winter.\n\"I think it's really going to end up benefitting the town in the long run,\" Poskaitis said.\nUnderwood and Associates Partner Chris Becraft delved further into the details of the project, discussing the reasons behind certain design choices. He gave examples of similar projects the engineering firm has worked on, including the living shoreline at Assateague State Park.\nDuring his presentation, Becraft said Underwood and Associates are not going anywhere.\n\"We are here,\" he said. \"And we look forward to hearing from you and working with you all for a successful project.\"\nAfter the presentations, many residents asked questions about the project. Questions ranged from specific design details, to how the project is being financed to how effective living shorelines are.\nMultiple residents asked about the wood placed on the points of the islands to accrete sand over time. One resident expressed concern that the logs could be a safety hazard for kids or for boats.\nBecraft said these logs are an added feature, not an engineering requirement. He said they can go if the community doesn't want them.\nBecraft also said the wood is beneficial when it comes to tidal events.\n\"They're that extra wave attenuater,\" he said.\nOne resident asked about the stability of sand accretion in this project.\nBecraft said that in 30 years, these types of shorelines have \"stood the test of time\" when it comes to sand. He said this is because the design imitates a naturally occurring process.\n\"So that formula — the distance between the island and the beach — that's a natural system,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, many people have complained to Sheriff Gamble since Maryland election law is being violated. As a good citizen and duly elected law enforcement officer, the sheriff wrote a letter to the election director questioning the intent of violating the law.For months, the election director has been dodging questions made by the public and apparently has been manipulating the law; however, this issue of flagrant abuse of the law has gone national. As anticipated, our Maryland state attorney general finally decided to weigh in. The Attorney General sent a letter to duly elected Sheriff reminding him that, as sheriff, he has nothing to do with enforcing election law.\nOf course, we citizens of all political parties have a responsibility to ensure fair and safe elections, and the sheriff, unlike the attorney general, was properly amplifying the disbelief of concerned citizens.\nIntentionally breaking the law? Are you really?\nAfter the slap, the attorney general quoted the law, which states each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges from Democrat and Republican parties. He then says that, although that is true at each polling place, the total number of judges need not be equal between the two parties. What? Where are these unequal judges on duty if not at a polling place?\nIn past years, the people of Talbot County were told by the director of the Board of Elections that there weren't enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges. Nonsense.\nIf judge totals must be equal at every polling place, then the totals across the county will be equal. There are now 61 Democrats, 53 Republicans and 10 \"other.\"\nIn our 10 precincts, only four abide by the law. It appears that information has been withheld from Talbot voters.\nWhat part of equal does the election director Tammy Stafford and the Talbot election board not understand?\nMARYANN JUDY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge moves portion of funds to state investment pool\n\n March 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 346\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — In an effort to grow its funds, the City of Cambridge is putting a portion of its money into the Maryland Local Government Investment Pool.The city expects to make between $175,000 and $200,000 in interest annually by moving some of its funds to the local government investment pool, an investment fund available to local communities in the state.\nAccording to a March 19 memo to the City Council from Cambridge Finance Director Perry Peregoy, this plan is part of an effort to \"streamline administrative tasks and benefit from a broader suite of treasury services and capital market opportunities.\" The memo the city would like to put \"idle\" funds, or money available for investment, into the Maryland Local Government Investment Pool to increase interest income.\nPeregoy said about $8 to $10 million of its current deposits in five different financial institutions could be considered \"idle.\"\nDuring a Cambridge City Council meeting March 24, the council authorized moving that money into the fund. Peregoy said at the meeting that the local government investment pool offers the highest interest rate the city can earn with minimal risk.\n\"It's really what I would refer to as almost as risk-less an investment as you can find in today's environment,\" he said.\nPeregoy said the city is currently making about 2.5% interest on all it's money. He said the local government investment pool is currently offering a 4.4% interest rate.\nCambridge City Manager Glenn Steckman said with interest rates up right now, this move will be a \"revenue generator.\"\nPeregoy also talked about the city's relationships with local banks. He said the city won't \"materially alter\" its local banking relationships.\n\"I've had preliminary conversations, and they all understand and they realize they can't match,\" Peregoy said about the seven banks the city currently deals with.\nPeregoy said the city will continue to keep a \"substantial amount of money\" in banks in the community in order to maintain its relationships with those banks.\n\"This will just be part of that ongoing cash management and treasury function that I hope to expand over the next year within the city,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trapping on the Eastern Shore (copy)\n\n February 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1623\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Back in the late 1950s and early 1960s, my younger brother Ollie would trap and hunt whatever was in season.My dad was very happy when he came home with rabbits and squirrels. The only thing he could not get my dad to eat was the muskrat, better known as the marsh rabbit.\nHe sold the meat to local folks who loved it, and mom loved it because he sold them as fast as he trapped them.\nMy brother would save the hides and stretch them on a special piece of board designed to fit the hide. He had them drying out for a certain number of days and then would package them up and ship them to his buyer.\nHis buyer was the late Mr. Clark Harrison Sr. of Preston. After several shipments, Mr. Harrison would send my brother a check.\nYears ago, I contacted Mr. Harrison and told him the story of my 14-year-old brother, who later retired from the United States Army and did three tours of duty in Vietnam. I will dedicate today's column to those two men — the late Clark Harrison Sr. and Ollie Lowe Hitchens Jr.\nAlong the Eastern Shore, trapping traditions have been passed down to sons, grandsons and nephews. Living here and working on the water or in the fields near huge ditch banks, it was only natural for these locals to trap muskrats.\nThey'd set their traps, then go to work farming or crabbing then check the traps for an extra bounty. The muskrat numbers were once estimated to be in the millions here on the Eastern Shore, but that number soon dwindled, as you can imagine with all the trapping.\nJust the sight of these animals was enough for me with the fur on, let alone skinning and cooking them.\nYou guessed it — I've never tasted muskrat, but I've cooked it. The first one I ever cooked was right in my Preston Road kitchen under the guidance of my late husband, John Williamson Sr., who loved them.\nJOHN R.'S FAVORITE MUSKRATTrap, clean and cut muskrat in half. Soak in a large pot of cold, salted water for several hours — changing water several times. Finally, after draining well, place the meat in a large pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, boiling for 5 minutes. Remove meat from the pot, rinse and clean out the pot well. Then spray the pot with a non-sticking spray, add the meat, half cover with water. Cook until meat falls apart. Add to taste: sage, red pepper, salt and bacon or sausage grease. Don't be afraid of adding any of these ingredients and just keep adding until you can taste all of them. Cook down as much as you want but do not let it cook dry. Serve with a favorite potato dish of your choice and a green vegetable.\nMUSKRAT STEWClean, cut in pieces and soak three muskrats in cold water and salt. After at least two hours, drain water off and rinse meat well. In a large pot, place the meat and just enough water to cover them. Add 2 teaspoons ground sage, 1/2 teaspoon bacon grease, salt and pepper to taste. Let cook over medium heat for 4 to 5 hours. Start on high heat until it starts boiling, then reduce heat to simmering. Let cook until meat is falling off the bone. Serve over cooked rice.\nFRIED MARSH RABBITClean, cut up and soak one or two marsh rabbits in salty water for several hours — changing water several times. Rinse well in several changes of water. Remove from water and pat dry. In a large bowl add flour, sage, salt and pepper. Dredge the pieces of meat in the flour mixture and place in a fry pan with cooking oil and add 2 or 3 strips of bacon. Brown on both sides, adding more sage if needed. When meat is browned on both sides, add some water to the pan, turn heat down and let simmer as the meat becomes tender and a gravy forms.\nBISHOPVILLE BULLFROG LEGS2 lb or 14 sets fresh or frozen frog legs, 1/3 cups milk, 2/3 cups corn flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp red pepper, shortening, or cooking oil for deep frying, lemon halves, 1/2 tsp accent food enhancer, 1/2 tsp garlic powder.\nIn a medium bowl combine corn flour, salt, pepper, accent and garlic powder. Coat Frog legs with corn flour mixture, In a saucepan or deep fryer heat about 2 inches melted shortening or cooking oil to 375 degrees. Fry coated frog legs a few at a time in deep hot oil for 1 to 2 minutes or until done. Drain on paper towels.\nHOPPING JOHN WITH VENISON2 full deer shanks, 1 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp your favorite All spice blend, 1 tsp salt, 4 cups beef stock, 3 garlic cloves (smashed), 1 celery stalk (chopped). Hoppin' John: ½ pound of dried black-eyed peas, 3 strips of bacon (chopped), ½ cup diced onion, ½ cup diced bell pepper, 1 clove garlic (minced), 1 celery stalk (diced), 3 cups of the reserved braising liquid, 2 tbsp your favorite All spice blend, 2 tsp salt, 1 cup of yellow rice (rinsed and drained), thinly sliced scallions for garnish. Bring a large pan to high heat on the stove. Rub the shanks with oil, All spice blend and salt. Once the pan is hot, sear each side of the shanks. Turn on the slow cooker and set it to low. Place the seared shanks inside and add the stock, garlic and celery. Allow the mixture to cook for 8 hours or until the meat falls off the bone. I cooked mine overnight. Once cooked, remove the meat from the slow cooker and set it aside. Strain and reserve the braising liquid for the next steps. For the Hoppin' John, place the black-eyed peas into a bowl and cover them with water. Allow them to sit while you complete the following steps. Bring the Dutch over to medium-high heat and stir in the chopped bacon. Brown the bacon and then remove bacon from the pan, leaving the grease behind. Stir in the onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic. Cook, frequently stirring, until the onion turns opaque.\nDrain the remaining water from the black-eyed peas. Stir the peas into the pot. Add three cups of the braising liquid from the deer shanks, the All spice blend and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and allow to simmer for 45-60 minutes or until the peas begin to soften. You do not want them to completely cook. While waiting, shred the deer meat. When the peas are al dente, there should be about two cups of liquid remaining. Add more if needed. Stir in the rice and the shredded deer and bring the mixture back to a simmer. Cover and allow to cook for 20 minutes or until the rice is done. Serve with the sliced green onions atop, along with some biscuits.\nRABBIT STEW3-4 pounds rabbit, 6 potatoes (quartered), 8 carrots (sliced), 1 medium onion (chopped), 1 tsp salt, 1/4 cup beef consommé, 3/4 cup beef broth, 3/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp basil, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 tsp rosemary, 1/4 tsp thyme. Cut rabbit into pieces. Layer onion, potatoes and carrots in the bottom of a crock pot. Add spices to the pot. Add rabbit, salt, pepper, consommé and about 3/4 cup beef broth. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. Thicken gravy as desired.\nBRAISED RABBIT2 rabbits cut into serving pieces, 1/4 pound bacon, 3 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium onion (sliced into half-moons), 1 head garlic (cloves peeled but not chopped), white part of a fennel bulb (chopped roughly), a handful of dried mushrooms, 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, 3 bay leaves, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 1 tsp fennel seeds, 3 cups good stock (chicken or vegetable), 5 spring onions, 1 cup finely chopped fennel fronds, 2 tbsp fresh chopped oregano, salt. Cook the dried mushrooms in 2 cups of hot water. Let them sit, covered, for at least 1 hour. Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven and cook bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon and turn the heat up to medium-high. Salt the rabbit pieces and brown them well. Add the chopped onion, fennel bulb and the dried mushrooms and saute until they begin to brown. Add the fresh mushrooms and garlic and saute until they begin to brown. Add salt. Add the Armagnac and stir well to combine.\nTurn the heat all the way up and add back the rabbit, the bacon, and add the bay leaves, fennel seeds and dried oregano and mix well. Pour in just enough stock just to cover the rabbit. Do not totally submerge it. Bring to a simmer, taste for salt (add more if need be), cover and set over low heat for an hour, or 45 minutes if you are using chicken or domestic rabbit. After an hour, test to see if the meat is tender. You want it to be practically falling off the bone. At this point you can pull the rabbit from the pot, remove from the bone and add back to the pot or keep it in the pot on bone. Add the green onions, garlic and fennel fronds and stir to combine. Simmer uncovered for 3 minutes or until you believe it is done. Be careful to not overcook.\nThere are a few opportunities coming up for you to enjoy a great muskrat dinner without having to stare down skinned muskrats. This year, the 76th annual National Outdoor Show will be held Feb. 21 and 22, located at the South Dorchester K-8 school at 3485 Golden Hill Rd. in Church Creek. The muskrat will be served on Saturday only at 1 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A map geek’s quest to clean the nation, 1 watershed at a time\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alisha Camacho Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1411\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n By 11 a.m., Jon Merryman had collected 45 tires, 38 bags of trash, packs of shingles, a mattress, a playpen and remnants of an accident swept under a guardrail near College Park, Maryland.Merryman, 62, was frustrated and restless. The Nov. 6 election hadn't gone his way. A veteran and a man of action, he turned to a lifelong passion to cope: picking up trash.\nOver the following days, he cleaned up roadsides in 22 counties spanning Virginia and West Virginia.\n\"I call it channeling my anger,\" Merryman said, tone dropping.\nPhysical work helps him maintain his emotional and mental health. When he returned home to Catonsville, Merryman felt more rejuvenated and ready to face what came next. For him, cleaning up litter is a way to reclaim control, one piece of trash at a time, in a world that can feel overwhelming.\n\"I want people to feel like one person can make a difference,\" he said.\nMerryman traces his passion for protecting the environment to campaigns from his childhood. Campaigns like \"Smokey the Bear.\" \"Woodsy the Owl.\" The 1970s commercial \"Keep America Beautiful: The Crying Indian.\"\nWhile controversial today, the \"Keep America Beautiful\" ad had a simple message for 7-year-old Merryman: \"People start pollution. People can stop it.\" Inspired, he planned a post-Halloween mission to clean up wrappers and litter. With a full bucket, Merryman marched down to a storm drain, thinking that's where the trash should go.\n\"Thank God an adult was there,\" he said. The passerby explained how storm drains lead to rivers. He didn't know it yet, but Merryman would dedicate much of his adult life to rectifying this mistake.\nThe makings of a soldierMerryman's cousins, conservationists on Maryland's Eastern Shore, took him under their wings and ignited a passion for studying the environment. They invited him on bird banding and counting trips. Merryman remembers the sky filling with \"rivers of birds\" for 15 minutes at a time. Clicker in hand, he counted birds until his hand grew weary.\n\"You're witnessing the miracles of being on earth when you see stuff like that,\" Merryman said.\nHis cousins later dissuaded him from becoming a marine biologist.\n\"They got me geared up for this life of studying animals, then said, 'Oh, you don't want to do that. It's a life of chasing grants.'\"\nMerryman entered the University of Delaware as a biology major. Switched to geology. Jumped to civil engineering. His GPA plummeted. He pivoted to part-time status while working for the university. Eventually, he found his footing in geography while programming educational software. Also minored in photography.\nHis first summer out of college, Merryman worked as a volunteer ranger at the Grand Canyon, giving talks, leading groups and picking up trash in front of the visitor center. \"Funny thing is, that's what I love to do now: pick up trash.\"\nThe staff liked him and encouraged him to apply for a seasonal park ranger job, but then Congress slashed funding, so the job didn't exist.\nMerryman took on seasonal jobs. While working in the Everglades, he saw a billboard promoting the army's college fund.\nIt offered $20K for two years of service.\n\"Great option,\" he thought. He enlisted in the army and spent six years in the National Guard.\n'My wife puts up with a lot'When Merryman returned to civilian life, he worked in instructional technology. \"As it turns out, there's a lot of commonality between arranging the elements of a map and arranging the elements on a computer screen,\" he said.\nBut his passion for the environment remained. One day, while working at Lockheed Martin, Merryman came across a trash-strewn creek and park. He spent five years turning it into a sustainable habitat.\nHis hobby of picking up trash also found its way home. \"My driveway was full, I mean seriously, full of scrap metal,\" he said. He sold the metal from cleanups to fund his kids' robotics team. \"The things we do,\" Merryman chuckled.\nThrough it all, he said, it took a lot of patience from his wife, Kirsten. \"The spouses that put up with it are angels, too. They are. My wife puts up with a lot.\"\nTurns out, so do his kids.\nLitter everywhere in the middle of nowhere\nA common conundrum Merryman encounters is people acknowledging a problem but not taking responsibility. \"Someone else is doing the littering. It's those people,\" they think.\nMerryman became determined to show that littering is everyone's problem. During a road trip with his son to Los Angeles, an idea emerged, and they cleaned up trash in one county per state, adding two counties for Texas.\nWhen they arrived \"in the middle of nowhere\" in Turkey, Texas, Merryman found \"litter everywhere.\" He wanted people to realize that we are all responsible for this pile of trash because of all the things we buy and the resources we use.\nTo illustrate the extent of trash pollution, he started placing green dots on a map of counties he'd clean up.\n\"I'm a map geek,\" Merryman said. He had been tracking all the counties he visited for years, a hobby shared by fellow geographers. Now, he aims to pick up trash in every county for as long as possible.\nRecently, he picked his daughter up from school in Ithaca, New York. As they left Ithaca and crossed over into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, an idea \"dawned on me,\" he said.\nHe'd picked up trash in counties between Ithaca and Baltimore, having done this drive many times. \"I put those on the map,\" Merryman said when he realized he was nearly halfway done. \"I bet I could do them all\" in the watershed.\nHe now focuses on watersheds rather than state lines. Water carries pollution across borders, so \"state boundaries don't matter as much as the watershed,\" he said.\nOn Dec. 1, 2024, Merryman reached his goal. He picked up trash in all 206 counties in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Bringing his total count to 524. One-sixth of all counties in the United States.\nSharkey d'SharkOn February 2, 2022, at 2:22 p.m., Merryman retired — a moment he carefully planned. \"I walked out the door,\" said Merryman. \"I just thought it was funny.\"\nA few months later, Merryman found his retirement buddy, Sharkey d' Shark, on the side of the road. The abandoned toy-turned-sidekick became a playful way to engage others in cleanups.\nSharkey has a social media presence. \"It's a lot easier to have a back-and-forth conversation with Sharkey,\" Merryman said, \"as opposed to writing posts and getting crickets in response.\"\nMerryman hopes Sharkey can help educate and inspire younger generations to partake in cleanups. For now, \"about 90% of Sharky's fans are middle-aged women,\" he laughed.\nNature is innocentWhen not traveling to pick up trash, Merryman volunteers with Lights Out Baltimore, searching for dead or injured birds hit by windows due to disorienting artificial lights.\n\"Nature, as far as I'm concerned, is all innocent,\" Merryman said. Migrating birds navigate at night using the moon and stars, but lights lead them to windows. \"There's a reason it's happening. It's not because the bird's stupid,\" he said. The birds can't see the glass.\nNot long ago, Merryman found an old Facebook post when he first joined the group and held a bird for the first time in decades. Now, he's active in several Facebook groups where he educates others about window strikes. Sharing photos of the dead birds tends to upset people, especially those who have already seen them.\nOn the one hand, Merryman speaks to newcomers who aren't aware of this issue and spreads awareness \"over and over and over again.\" On the other hand, some people complain and don't want to see the photos.\n\"I'm sorry if it makes you feel squeamish,\" Merryman said, his tone serious. He paused. \"Actually, I'm not. I'm not sorry,\" he said with a wry laugh. \"I hope that it will make you care about it.\"\nIt is a difficult line to walk — getting people to care without turning them away. \"I'm just not good at drawing that line personally,\" he admitted.\nBut he is good at showing up and doing the dirty work. \"I'm happy to be the grunt, the foot soldier.\"\nMerryman has a plan for the rest of his retirement. He is going to pick up trash in every county in the United States. Until he physically can't anymore. Then he hopes to write a book.\nSo far, he's crossed off Arizona, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey while nearing the finish line in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nMaybe he won't reach his goal. \"But I'm gonna die trying.\" And maybe the world will be a little cleaner, with a few more birds in it. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Common ground: Citizens Connect launches with focus on saving Eastern Neck\n\n August 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Inspired by Washington College's class \"Bridging the Divide,\" Chestertown residents Joan Caivano and Eileen Kessler formed Citizens Connect, a forum designed to find common ground among people who disagree politically.Kessler said Citizens Connect's mission during the administration of President Donald Trump is to bring attention to the impact of federal policies and budget cuts on local interests.\nCaivano said since Trump was elected, there are many areas of concern — including immigration, health care and education — that the group seeks to discuss in a nonpartisan way.\nThe group's first public meeting focused on Eastern Neck Island, a major tourist attraction in Kent County and the Upper Shore.\nThe discussion, \"Eastern Neck: Can it Survive Federal Budget Cuts,\" was held Aug. 18 at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Chestertown, where Caivano and Kessler are members.\n\"The survival of Eastern Neck Island is in jeopardy,\" Kessler told an audience of about 80.\nGuest speakers included Friends of Eastern Neck President Bill Burton and Vice President Bonnie Ford. They described the work of their nonprofit organization, which has about 300 members and 50 volunteers. The group assists the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which maintains the refuge and whose work could be threatened by budget cuts.\nBurton, who has worked in environmental sciences for 44 years, said the group has been instrumental in projects such as repairing the slate roof of the 1930 lodge and replacing windows, a $55,000 expense. They also staff the visitor center, tend the butterfly garden and help with repairs wherever needed.\nBut those services could be threatened, he said.\nFord said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, so cuts to the department affect the refuge.\nFord added that over many years, there have been cuts regardless of which party controlled the White House.\nIn Maryland, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, located 12 miles south of Cambridge, operates the Chesapeake Marshlands complex of four refuges, one of which is Eastern Neck Island.\nThe Blackwater staff has diminished over time.\n\"In 2007, there were 23 employees. Currently there are 11,\" Ford said. \"And Eastern Neck currently has no on-site staff but relies on those from Blackwater.\"\nFord said although the problem seemed bipartisan, Elon Musk's email across federal agencies concerning voluntary retirement and mandatory buyouts led to further staff reductions.\n\"Some at the beginning of the year took the retirement offer and Blackwater staff dropped from 14 to 11,\" she said.\nAdditionally, an executive order signed Feb. 25 requires department heads to submit a reduction in force plan. The speakers said this has decreased morale among U.S. Fish and Wildlife personnel.\nThe reduction in force plan has not been made public, but Friends of Eastern Neck want to be proactive. Their goal is to avoid further losses and keep staffing at current levels.\nBurton said the staff is essential.\n\"Staff are not just there to mow the lawn,\" he said. \"They are specialists and biologists employing scientific techniques to maximize the refuge's potential. They do controlled burns. They raise and lower levels in ponds. They grow habitats for wildlife and much more.\"\nWithout their services, the refuge would close, Burton said. Friends of Eastern Neck said it is a place they cannot lose, drawing 70,000 visitors annually.\nFord urged attendees to join a letter-writing campaign to local, state and federal lawmakers. More information is available on the Friends of Eastern Neck website, friendsofeasternneck.org.\n\"Don't just assume because of politics they will not seek to protect the refuge. Seeing people care about this has been a very humbling experience for me,\" she said.\nShe said there is common ground between hunters, anglers, environmentalists and politicians on the need to \"maintain a refuge … as a refuge.\"\nPublic comment produced more ideas.\nOne person suggested involving the public school system by having children draw pictures of the refuge to influence lawmakers. Another suggested mobilizing people to raise awareness about climate change. Someone else recommended enlisting business bureaus.\nDucks Unlimited and other outdoor organizations have strong lobbying influence, said one woman active in politics.\nShe noted that U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who serves on the appropriations committee, and U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) are particularly involved in this issue.\nPeople exited the meeting energized and united over the local issue, which pleased the organizers. Afterward, membership in Citizens Connect increased, Burton said.\n\"I think Burton and Ford did a beautiful job speaking across the political spectrum and to the community,\" Kessler said.\nThe next Citizens Connect meeting will be Sept. 15 at the Kent Cultural Alliance. The topic will be how to talk with people from different backgrounds and political views. Anthony Flaccavento, founding director of the Rural-Urban Bridge Initiative, will be the guest speaker. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Just play baseball the way they know how, and don't do too much.\"\nTalbot followed those instructions while riding the solid one-two pitching punch of Nathan Merchant and Couper Barletta on the way to a 5-2 title-clinching victory over Dorchester at Hog Neck.\nTalbot was scheduled to play Brunswick on Saturday in the first round of the state tournament in Berlin.\n\"It's a fantastic group of kids,\" said White, whose team won the best-of-three series 2-1. \"We're pulling them from three different high schools (Easton, St. Michaels, Saints Peter and Paul). But they jelled well. They've been accepting of, I don't want to say a diminished role. Let's say they were a shortstop at their school, but we're asking them to play left field. And everyone has bought into the team concept. Everyone has contributed.\"\nTalbot won the series opener 13-3 in Hurlock on June 24. Dorchester knotted the series at one-all the following night with a 14-7 win, setting up the decisive Game 3.\nDorchester took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first inning of the title game on Jackson Nehring's RBI single.\nBut Talbot responded with a four-run rally in the bottom of the first for a lead it never surrendered.\nBuel Jensen knocked in the tying run with a fielder's choice. Jace Elliott and Finley Carter each worked back-to-back bases-loaded walks to make it 3-1. Brody McDaniel, Talbot's No. 9 hitter, then laid down a two-out RBI bunt single to give Talbot a three-run lead after one complete.\nMerchant got the starting nod on the mound for Talbot and yielded two unearned runs and two hits over four innings, striking out two and walking three. Barletta came on in relief to seal the victory.\n\"It was very effective,\" White said of his team's pitching combination. \"Both guys. Different styles. Merchant gets a lot of weak contact, and then Barletta comes in and he's more of a strikeout, power pitcher.\nMcDaniel finished 2 for 3 with a pair of RBIs, and Elliott also drove in two runs. Talbot finished with 10 walks, with Ben White and Carter each drawing two. Jensen added two stolen bases.\nNehring, Dorchester's clean-up hitter, finished 2 for 3. Dorchester totaled seven stolen bases, led by Ryan Robinson, who had three.\nCarson Weber started on the mound for Dorchester, allowing four runs but no hits in 2/3 of an inning. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Public weighs in on emergency food processing residual bill\n\n August 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An earlier version of this story contained incorrect information about the status of the bill. The commissioners did not vote on the bill Tuesday.DENTON — The Caroline County Commissioners held a public hearing on a controversial bill concerning the permitting of food processing residuals Aug. 6.\nIf the bill is passed after the commissioners' third hearing on Aug. 20, storing these residuals in Caroline County would require a permit. The bill also allows for inspection and civil or criminal penalties if a storage site is found to be in violation.\n\"This is not banning storage of food processing residuals,\" Commissioner Larry Porter said. \"If someone feels strongly about using it as a soil amendment and wants to store it, they can come in and apply once these regulations are set.\"\nThe bill requires the use of closed-top storage tanks for food processing residuals, going a step further than state regulations passed during this year's General Assembly. House Bill 991, which took effect July 1, created a state permitting process under the Maryland Department of Agriculture for the use, storing and hauling of the residuals.\nCaroline County's bill is the latest development in what has been months of packed public hearings and extended moratoriums on residual storage tanks. For county commissioners, the main hurdle has been cracking down on a few \"bad actors\" that store the residuals irresponsibly.\nThe bill garnered mixed reviews from Caroline County residents, environmental experts and representatives of the poultry industry at prior public hearings. Several took to the podium Aug. 6 to voice their opposition or support of the legislation.\nMike Woodward, the owner of a Ridgely farm right next to an open-top residual storage facility, voiced support for the bill.\n\"I am 400 yards from the tank itself... We have a lot of issues with flies. The odor is atrocious at times,\" Woodward said. \"We had a vet come out. We were having trouble with our horses. Their eyes were watering and runny and nasty. We couldn't figure out what was going on with them. The vet checked them out and the flies were laying larvae inside their eyes.\"\nBrad Sears, a Ridgely commissioner, said, \"I come before you on behalf of the Town of Ridgely in support of the emergency legislative bill. I offer this testimony to advocate for the men, women and children, who live, work and attend school and play within the town limits. We have concern because of improper storage of FPR (food processing residuals) poses well documented threats to human life, health and wellbeing.\"\nHe said open-top containers do nothing to limit \"odors, the exposure to vectors, the airborne bacteria and viruses.\"\nHolly Porter, executive director of the Delmarva Chicken Association, has been a vocal opponent of the county's bill in prior public hearings. She spoke again in opposition of the legislation on Tuesday.\n\"I really and truly would like the commissioners to consider some way of grandfathering in the farmers who are utilizing and storing food processing residuals for years without the complaints we have had in the past,\" she said. \"If we do not do that, we are impacting other farmers who are becoming collateral damage because of one unfortunately bad actor.\"\nResponding to Holly Porter's comments, Larry Porter said, \"Grandfathering in, unfortunately would have to include grandfathering in what Miss. Porter referred to as the 'bad actor.' ... you can't enforce laws on some people and not all people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I couldn't have asked for a better band to back me up or a better crowd to share the experience with. I am lucky to have so much support with my family, friends and this community.\"\nThe audience felt lucky to hear her perform.\nThese past few months have kept her on her toes.\nCurrently, she runs her music school, Mooday's Music, LLC, located at 151 Dixon Drive Suite 4 in Chestertown.\nShe's also preparing for a mission's trip to Costa Rica with her fellow church members at Hope Fellowship.\nLearn more about Mooday's Music LLC by visiting her website, moodaysmusicllc.org, and be sure to check out all of her work, which includes albums, singles and EPs that date all the way back to 2017 on Spotify. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Easton Utilities immediately reported these overflows to state and local health authorities and promptly treated the areas affected with lime to disinfect the surfaces around the points of discharge.Easton Utilities strongly urges the public and food service establishments to be mindful of what they release to the sewer lines.Only human waste and toilet paper should be flushed - disinfecting and \"flushable\" wipes and other items should be properly disposed of in the trash, not the toilet.These wipes and other items do not break down in sewer or septic systems and can damage the internal plumbing in homes as well.In addition, everyone should keep fats oil, and grease out of drains to prevent blockages or backups.\"Easton Utilities remains committed to the safe, sanitary removal of wastewater while minimizing the impact to our environment,\" said Doug Abbott, Easton Utilities' engineering, water and wastewater department manager.No customers were impacted by this event. While the Talbot County Health Department has confirmed there is minimal impact on public health, regulation requires a press release be distributed to notify the general public. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tenor Jonathan Tetelman stars as the callous American naval officer Pinkerton, whose betrayal destroys her. Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong reprises the role of the steadfast maid Suzuki, and baritone Lucas Meachem is the American consul Sharpless. Acclaimed maestro Xian Zhang takes the podium on May 11 to conduct Anthony Minghella's vivid production. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met's award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.\nDar Williams with Guest Heather Maloney\nSaturday, May 11\nDoors: 7:30 a.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nDar Williams' lyrics contain bouquets of optimism, delivered on melodies alternating between beguiling lightness and understated gravity.\nAlways in the right place at the right time for the success she's had over a 25+year career, Dar rose out of the vibrant mid-90's Boston scene, inspired by the eclectic influences of alt-rockers, Berklee jazz musicians, slam poets, and folk artists like Patty Griffith, Melissa Ferrick, the Throwing Muses, Vance Gilbert, and Jonatha Brooke.\nThrough all the ups and downs, however, it's always been about staying true to herself. \"Good and bad things happen, and it's not necessarily a reward or indictment. I've just got to meet it,\" she observes. \"Like, I'm bringing my whole life to this moment; it will surprise me, challenge me, show me where I was wrong, even make a fool out of me, but my job is to show up and not take adversity personally. Real happiness doesn't have to feel like Snoopy dancing with Woodstock; it can just be knowing you have the resilience to meet whatever comes to you. I will call that a good life.\"\nDar will be joined by special guest Heather Maloney, a Massachusetts-based singer songwriter whose voice is her \"not-so-secret weapon\" (Boston Globe) and whose \"lyrics cut to the chase\" (Huffington Post).\nMinor Gold\nWednesday, May 15\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Doors: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nMinor Gold are ARIA-nominated artists Tracy McNeil and Dan Parsons. Canadian and Australian, respectively, this Trans-Pacific duo echo '70s cosmic Americana with an easy charm and potent honesty.\nThe strength of the songwriting and the indeterminate perfection of how these two artists' voices lock in together hit right where the emotions live inside us. With dynamics ranging from the intense restraint of campfire intimacy through to open-throttle abandon, Minor Gold delight and enthrall as they weave masterful harmonies and deft guitar playing around unforgettable, stripped-back performances.\nSince releasing their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album in August 2023, the duo have been on the road—recently returning from a 30-date North American album tour with supports for The Teskey Brothers and an official showcase at AmericanaFEST in Nashville, as well as the 2024 Folk Alliance International in Kansas City. https://www.minorgoldmusic.com/\nJulian Brezon\nFriday, May 17, 2024\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nNew York-based Easton native Julian Brezon returns to the Stoltz with a stellar quartet presenting jazz standards and original compositions.

Dover Street, Easton, MD\nSouthside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes emerged from the New Jersey shore scene in 1974, and though they carried over a significant influence (and some key personnel) from Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, the Jukes evolved as more of an R&B horn band in the Memphis Stax Records tradition.\nOrganized by singer John Lyon, guitarist/songwriter Steve Van Zandt (who decamped for the E Street Band in 1975, but continued to produce, manage, and write songs for the Jukes) and Richie Rosenberg, the band is well known for high-energy shows and no-holds-barred songs, including \"I Don't Wanna Go Home,\" \"Havin' a Party,\" \"The Fever,\" \"Talk to Me,\" \"Trapped Again,\" and \"This Time It's For Real.\"\nStill tinged with the exuberant rhythm and blues feel that is the Jukes' trademark, and loaded with the driving sound of the legendary Jukes horn section, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes continue to expound their signature Jersey Shore sound – all for the sheer joy of it. https://www.southsidejohnny.com/\nThe Brothers Comatose\nThursday, June 20\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nWhether traveling to gigs on horseback or by tour bus, Americana mavens The Brothers Comatose forge their own path with raucous West Coast renderings of traditional bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll music.

I love this stuff so much, I must admit to being slightly compulsive - gathering, testing and assessing techniques. Here are a few of my new favorites: BERRIESAre you familiar with that sick feeling that comes when you notice that the berries you bought yesterday are already showing signs of mold and turning brown? Here's the remedy: As soon as you bring them into the kitchen, prepare a mixture of one part vinegar (white or apple cider) and 10 parts water. Give the berries a bath in the mixture.Swirl them around a bit and then gently drain, rinse and place in the refrigerator.Don't worry. The solution is so weak, you will not taste the vinegar. This treatment should give your strawberries an additional two weeks of useful life and raspberries a week or more. Vinegar retards the growth of bacteria that causes berries to spoil so quickly.POTATOESTo keep potatoes from growing big ugly sprouts before you have time to use them up, store them with a couple of apples. For some reason, that really works to halt the sprouting.ALUMINUM FOILLet me just say that I'm a believer! It drives me crazy that I do not know why this works, but it certainly does: Wrap celery, broccoli and lettuce in a single layer of aluminum foil before storing in the refrigerator. Celery will stay crisp and fresh for up to a month stored this way. It's simply amazing.MUSHROOMSStore mushrooms in a paper bag. Now the air can circulate and the mushrooms will remain dry and lovely for weeks.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gluten-Free Bakery Girl rises to the challenge\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It began as a challenge for an already established cook.Tricia King, owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, said that during her time as a personal chef, she had a client with rheumatoid arthritis who needed to avoid gluten in her diet. King undertook the task of creating tasty gluten-free recipes.\nNow, about 20 years later, she is the owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, an entirely gluten-free bakery on the Eastern Shore.\nKing centers the health and well-being of her customers in everything she does, and that includes making sure all her baked goods are not only safe but also a delight to eat.\nThe passion for tasty food has been a long love of King's. She has been cooking almost all her life, and even when she wasn't cooking, she was studying and watching other cooks like Julia Child and her mother. She said that cooking just came naturally to her.\n\"When you have a passion for it, it's easy to do it,\" King said. \"I've loved food my whole life.\"\nAfter studying interior design, she decided to open a personal chef business in Salt Lake City, Utah, called Purple Pomegranate. For two years, she traveled from house to house every day, doing the shopping and cooking for two weeks and then repeating the same cycle with different clients.\nThen, she had the opportunity to be a sous chef in a hotel in Scotland.\nIt was there that she dove into baking. When she came back to the States, she trained under pastry chef Matt Ratliff in the Perry Cabin.\nThe work was intense, King said. Daily, the kitchen would produce 40 souffles, bake bread and cookies, and make wedding cakes.\nIn the back of her mind, she still yearned to open her dream bakery. So, she began using the back kitchen to try different gluten-free desserts.\nBefore she made the leap to establish her bakery, she shared her dream with one of her friends, and he said, \"Oh, it's never going to work. A gluten-free bakery?\" She smiles, recollecting the memory and how he has since taken back his words.\nGluten-Free Bakery Girl has been in business in St. Michaels for 12 years and will be opening in a bigger location in Easton. Its products can be found throughout Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Massachusetts, New York and other states nationwide.\nKing said the vast majority of her customers have celiac disease, an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Due to this, it is of the utmost importance that there is no cross-contamination in her kitchen.\nShe operates in a 100% certified gluten-free facility and kitchen.\nAll products are individually wrapped to prevent any potential cross-contamination from other foods during shipping and sale, and all employees are only allowed to bring gluten-free food to work.\n\"People don't understand that you can't just bake in a kitchen and then wipe it down and then bake gluten-free,\" King said. \"Twenty parts per million, which is a crumb of bread, is enough to make someone who has celiac disease sick.\"\nMore than anything, King wants to help people with celiac disease lead a more accessible and safer day-to-day life. King said her customers with celiac disease often feel that they need to miss out on treats for their health, but having the opportunity to provide people the chance to indulge in a baked good makes all the effort she puts in her bakery worth it.\nKing urges young girls thinking of starting a bakery or any business to have faith in themselves and allow themselves to grow outside their comfort zones.\n\"We women are the hardest on ourselves,\" King said. \"We beat ourselves up the most. It puts blocks in front of us, but we have to know we can make it through. So, keep going. You have to keep going.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "More information on Dorchester charter amendments\n\n October 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last time I wrote about the first three proposed Charter Amendments that are on the ballot in Dorchester County this November. Two of the next three are similar and one has more background information required to help you understand the reason for it.Question D seeks to clarify certain of the responsibilities of the county manager including the day-to-day operation of county government and establishing procedures for certain vacancies. This requires some explanation.\nWhen the Dorchester Citizens for Better Government began to look at the day-to-day management of county government, we found a couple of things. Every employee was an \"at will\" employee, and anyone could be terminated upon a vote of three members of the council for whatever reasons they might have, no matter how long the person had worked for the county.\nWe also found that at times some of the council members were telling the staff what to do and how to do it. The county manager position went for months without any effort by the council to find a replacement.\nThe Charter Commission did significant work on this proposed amendment to help ensure that there was a more timely transition when a county manager left or was terminated, allowed for the appointment of an assistant county manager subject to funding, allowed for studies to be done when appropriate, established a time limitation for searches for a replacement of the county manager, and most importantly established that the county manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of county government and that the council is to deal with the administrative and departmental services through the county manager and not through direct orders to staff members.\nAdding the above language to the existing language that \"all departments, agencies, and offices of the Government shall be subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the County Manager under the authority of the Council…\" ensures that the employees work with and under the authority of the county manager and that he or she is subject to the direction and authority of the County Council.\nOf all of the proposed amendments, the passage of this one will help to ensure a more efficient and effective working environment that will benefit the entire county and its residents.\nWith Question E, the proposed change removes the requirement that the director of finance be a resident of Dorchester County. As this is a particularly important job in county government and finding the best person can be a challenge and restricting the council in where the finance director can live simply limits their ability to find the most qualified person. What is true about where the county manager lives is also true for the finance director.\nThe current County Council has informally addressed the final Question F. When the Dorchester Citizens for Better Government saw what challenges people faced with attending the council meetings in person, we urged that the meetings go on the internet so that people could watch government at work and be able to communicate about the meetings without having to be there in person. The prior council rejected these requests at first and finally agreed to them. Having the meetings on Town Hall Streams benefited everyone.\nThe language of this Charter Amendment simply puts it in the law that the current and all future councils shall ensure the transparency of the county government by having the ability of the public to attend meetings in person or virtually and have a clear understanding of their right to access to public records.\nThe vote in November for all of these questions should all be \"yes\" so that the running of county government is more transparent and more efficient and effective for the benefit of all of the citizens of Dorchester County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But none of us want that. I think he kind of brought that out of us, just saying we could be going to Navy this Friday to win a championship that hasn't been done in a decade.\"\nThe Sabres responded, outscoring No. 4 Gerstell Academy by three goals in a decisive third quarter, catapulting them to a 13-8 victory on a dreary Tuesday afternoon.\nSts. Peter & Paul (15-4) advances to Friday's MIAA B Conference championship game where it will meet second-seed and two-time defending champion Archbishop Curley (11-7) at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium at 5 p.m. The Sabres defeated Curley twice during the regular season.\n\"They were taking a team lightly, like they've already won,\" said Wolters, whose team won 7-6 at Gerstell on April 12, then routed the Falcons 16-3 on their home turf April 30. \"And they've done that before. We just lose focus.\"\nIn his first game back from injury, JJ Rardin (five goals) gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter, when he scored off an assist from Andrew Steinhardt.\nGerstell (6-10) tied the score on Bronson Peters' goal less than 2 minutes into the second quarter. Rardin gained possession out in front of the net and fired his second goal just under the crossbar to make it 2-1 just 18 seconds later. But the Falcons came right back with Ryan Ellis beating Sabres goalie Hank Wolters (11 saves) to make it 2-all.\nDavis Kimminau whipped a shot in from the right side, and less than two minutes later, set up Vincent Dyer's goal to nudge Sts. Peter & Paul to a 4-2 lead. But Peters (four goals) scored at the midway point of the second quarter to make it a one-goal game again.\n\"They came out and they didn't want their season to end,\" Messick said of Gerstell. \"They came out with nothing to lose. We're the one seed. They come out and they beat us, then it's a huge upset. And if they don't it's not what they were expected to do. So I think they had that mentality while we came out thinking, 'Well, we smoked them before. We're going to roll them this time.' But they didn't. They came out and they fought really hard.\"\nThe Sabres scored the last three goals of the half, as Liam Durnbaugh, Noah Zimmerman and Rardin each tallied to make it 7-3 at the break.\n\"Our guys were in it,\" Gerstell head coach Ryan Drenner said. \"We stayed in the fight the entire game. That was the biggest difference. We were here a couple weeks ago April 30. Very lopsided. We try to learn a lesson from every game regardless of the outcome of the game. And so for that one it was we had to come up with a better plan of how to travel down here and be ready to go from the jump. So we changed how we warm up just to be a little bit more alert from the start. I thought our guys did that today and we played four quarters of a great lacrosse game.\"\nGerstell cut its deficit to 7-4 just 19 seconds into the third quarter on a goal by Peters. Zimmerman scored for the Sabres, but Matthew Schols answered for the Falcons.\nSts. Peter & Paul took control the remainder of the quarter, getting one goal each from Steinhardt (four assists) and Kimminau, and two more from Rardin for a 12-5 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\"We know how good we are,\" Wolters said. \"The third quarter we go and we really just started opening it up. And then in the fourth quarter we thought it was done.\"\nThe Sabres extended their lead to 13-5 before Gerstell scored the game's final three goals.\n\"We weren't hustling,\" Wolters said of certain stretches. \"We'd come down and throw it away and then they would go down and score on unsettled situations. They had eight goals and I know five to six were unsettled and we can't have that.\n\"It's a win. We'll take it,\" Wolters said. \"You can't win a championship unless you're in the championship. And we're in the championship.\"\nBASEBALL\nCOL. RICHARDSON 1, ST. MICHAELS 0\nAMERICAN CORNER — Jack Walls walked, advanced to second and third on a pair of low pitches, and raced home on a wild pitch in the third inning for what proved to be the only run Tuesday, as Colonel Richardson blanked the Saints to win the Class 1A East Region II final.\nColonel Richardson winning pitcher Daniel Hesson hurled a two-hitter. Connor Wheeler and Henry Mullikin each had a hit for the Saints.\nSt. Michaels pitcher Jacob Seek allowed one hit, that coming with two outs in the sixth inning when Hesson singled. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "War in the Holy Land - More Dems pressure Biden to publicly freeze $6B in Iranian assets; potential wider conflict confront Israel, Gaza\n\n October 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 1493\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More U.S. senators, including Democrats, are joining the push to get the Biden administration to refreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets released as part of a September prisoner swamp after Hamas' attacks, including killing civilians, inside Israel.The effort comes as urban warfare in Gaza and worries of a wider conflict in the Middle East confront Israel as it strikes back at Hamas in the Palestinian territory.On the Iranian asset front, the Biden administration continues to be pushed to refreeze the $6 billion in Iranian assets after the Hamas killings, which included women and children. Tehran is a prime backer of Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants.Last week, Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Tester on Montana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined the chorus of Republicans pressing Biden to refreeze the Iranian money after the bloodshed.U.S. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Marco Rubio of Florida are part of that GOP push.On Friday, Tester and Manchin were joined by 12 other senators (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats and one independent) in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in asking the White House to publicly freeze the Iranian money.\"We write to you in light of Hamas' violent and horrific terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 which killed over a thousand innocent civilians, including American citizens. Given Iran's history of supporting acts of terrorism through Hamas, the United States must do everything in its power in the wake of this brutal attack to ensure that Iran is not in a position to continue funding Hamas' terrorist activities in Israel and throughout the Middle East,\" the senators wrote.\"While we understand that there are reports of an agreement with Qatar to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets, we urge you to make this decision official U.S. policy and continue your efforts to limit Iran's ability to provide support to Hamas.\" Senators that are part of the push include Republicans Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio as well as Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto (both of Nevada) and Independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.A quiet deal?The Biden administration has stopped short of confirming reports that the U.S. and Qatar have reached a quiet deal to sequester the Iranian money. Blinken and White House national security spokesman John Kirby have resisted confirming the Qatar reports or publicly committing to refreezing the assets.Instead, they have stressed that Iran has not touched any of the $6 billion and that money is overseen by the U.S. and is supposed to only be used for humanitarian aid inside Iran.U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said the quiet deal relate to the Iranian money could be temporary and he wants Congress to move to make the refreezing permanent.Daines backs that effort.\"We have witnessed horrific attacks on the Israeli people by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas. The United States needs to lead by example and sanction this dangerous regime,\" Daines said.Kirby stressed Friday other U.S. sanctions related to Iran and its help for militant and terrorist groups.Israel at war The White House national security spokesman also said there were no plans to put U.S combat troops in Israel as the Israel Defense Forces prepare for an expected invasion of Gaza where Hamas is based and more than 2.1 million people live in area roughly the same size as Philadelphia and Detroit.There have been more than 1,200 Israelis killed in the Hamas terror attacks.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted pictures on Twitter/X showing \"babies murdered and burned\" in the Saturday, Oct. 7 carnage.The Palestinian Health Authority reports more than 1,500 deaths in Gaza with continued IDF shelling and missile strikes since the Hamas attacks.Israel has also told residents of Gaza to evacuate to certain years with a ground invasion expected. The IDF made some incursions into Gaza Friday.The U.S. has moved an aircraft carrier group into the Mediterranean Sea as well as more fighter jets into the region as deterrence for Iran and other anti-Israeli actors involving themselves in the Hamas fight.U.S. Secretary of State Lloyd Austin visited Israel Friday after Blinken's stop there Thursday in shows of support for Israel after the Hamas killings.\"We're rapidly moving to provide IDF (with) resources to include ammunition and interceptors to resupply (the) Iron Dome.These critical assets will help ensure Israel has what it needs to defend its cities and citizens,\" Austin said in a social media post.Netanyahu and Israeli officials say they are ready to go neighborhood-by-neighborhood to root out and crush Hamas.\"We will obliterate Hamas, we will triumph. It might take time, but we will end this war stronger than ever. 'May the Almighty cause the enemies who rise up against us to be struck down before them,'\" Netanyahu said Friday.The fate of Gaza An Israeli ground offensive will create urban warfare fighting potentially a kin to fights in Iraq, Somalia and Chechnya with plenty of peril of the Gaza's 2.1 million civilian population.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said Israel's siege of Gaza has cut off food, water and power to Gaza with potential catastrophic consequences.\"It has become a matter of life and death. It is a must; fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General.No humanitarian supplies have been allowed into Gaza for a week now, the UN group said.The UN group said with power cut off Palestinians have been forced to use water from wells, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.\"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women. Water is now the last remaining lifeline.I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" said Lazzarini.On the left, some progressives and critics of Israel are worried about civilian deaths in Gaza where 47% of the population are children.\"I am calling for immediate de-escalation and ceasefire to save countless civilian lives, no matter their faith or ethnicity. Our government must lead with compassion for all civilians. I believe in my heart that the majority of Americans want the killing and violence to stop. War crimes cannot be answered with war crimes,\" said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan.\"Millions of people in Gaza-half of them children-have been given an impossible 24 hour evacuation order, but they have nowhere to go. They have been cut off from electricity, food, and water for days.Hospitals are running out of electricity to keep babies and the injured alive. The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians is a war crime, the confirmed use of white phosphorus bombs in Gaza is a war crime, yet there are no statements demanding these violations stop from the American political establishment.\" Pope Francis has called for a new mindset in the Middle East and holy land for Christians, Jews and Muslims.\"Terrorism and extremism do not help to reach a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, but fuel hatred, violence, revenge, and only cause each to other suffer. The Middle East need a peace built on dialogue and the courage of fraternity,\" the Roman Catholic leader said.Thats a difficult sell with Israel's mourning the loss of life, including children, at the hands of Hamas and Palestinian militants hoping for a wider, regional conflict.U.S. support for Israel President Joe Biden has voiced steadfast support for Israel in the Gaza war but has also stressed the need to abide by the \"laws of war.\" Many Republicans have said they back Israel's offensive in Gaza.\"Israel has every right to use every force need to repel what just happened to them,\" said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas.U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, endorsed Roy's statement on social media and GOP presidential candidates such as former U.S. UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov.Ron DeSantis also support the IDF's and Netanyahu's promises to crush and obliterate Hamas.\"Hamas showed no restraint when it slaughtered innocent Israelis. Hamas is evil and must be eradicated.We must stand with Israel-not just when it is hit, but also when it hits back,\" Haley said. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS I\n \nPalestinians leave their houses following Israeli airstrikes in Rafah refugee camp, southern Gaza Strip, Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023.\n \nOHAD ZWIGENBERG\n \nIsraeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border in southern Israel on Thursday, Oct.12, 2023.\n \nTWITTER/X\n \nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Israel Friday in a show of U.S. support for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces hitting back at Hamas after Saturday's bloodshed by Hamas.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nSupporters of the religious party Jamaat-e-Islami take part in a rally against Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and to show solidarity with the Palestinians, in Lahore, Pakistan, Friday, Oct. 13, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former Cecil County deputy gets one year in misconduct case\n\n January 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CARL HAMILTON cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1088\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CECIL COUNTY — A former Cecil County Sheriff's Office deputy who took and sent sexually explicit photos and videos of himself and two women, including one picture that he took of his genitals — while on duty, in uniform and inside agency headquarters — received a one-year jail term on Wednesday, according to the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor.Visiting Retired Kent County Circuit Court Judge Paul M. Bowman imposed a five-year sentence on the defendant — Elkton resident Kyle Logan Thomas, 28 — for misconduct in office and then suspended four years of the penalty, prosecutors said. Bowman also imposed a suspended one-year sentence on Thomas for visual surveillance with prurient intent, prosecutors added.\nIn addition, the judge ordered Thomas to serve three years of supervised probation after completing his one-year jail term, prosecutors reported.\n\"The defendant's conduct is best described as depraved, sadistic, and vicious,\" Bowman reportedly remarked from the bench while sentencing Thomas.\nThe sentence imposed by Bowman matched a recommendation made by Assistant State Prosecutor Abigail E. Ticse, who handled the criminal case with Deputy State Prosecutor Sarah R. David.\nAfter Wednesday's sentencing, Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said, \"I am proud of our office's efforts to build a strong case against a law enforcement officer who was sworn to protect and serve, not to abuse and traumatize, the residents of Cecil County. We appreciate the Court's sentence and believe that it demonstrates to the residents of Cecil County and the entire State of Maryland that real consequences await people who commit crimes such as these, especially by those that hold positions of public trust.\"\nThomas had pleaded guilty to those two charges in October, as part of a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to dismiss nine related charges against him, according to court records and Cecil Whig archives.\nIn August, two months earlier, Thomas was charged with misconduct in office, witness retaliation, visual surveillance with prurient intent, revenge porn, and distribution of obscene material. Thomas was not arrested, but rather was served charging papers.\nThomas had worked as a sworn Cecil County deputy for approximately two and a half years — from February 2021 until July 18, 2023 when the agency \"separated Deputy Kyle Thomas from employment\" amid an internal investigation into the allegations made against him, according to Capt. Michael Holmes, a CCSO spokesman. Thomas had been on suspension, per protocol, during his last nine months with the sheriff's office after the agency received a citizen complaint on Oct. 28, 2022 regarding his purported off-duty and on-duty misconduct, he noted.\nAs part of an overview in the charging document, prosecutors explained, \"Thomas, who was married, frequently utilized Snapchat to communicate and exchange photos and videos with other users because the communications or other exchanges typically disappear.\"\nThomas had a romantic relationship with a woman, who ended that relationship in August 2021, prosecutors reported.\n\"Throughout their relationship, Thomas shared photographs and videos with Victim I, primarily via Snapchat, depicting Thomas engaged in sexual acts,\" according to prosecutors.\nAt approximately 12:20 p.m. on June 16, 2021 — while on duty amid a shift that went from 7:45 a.m. to 7 p.m. that day — Thomas shared a video with VICTIM I using the \"My Eyes Only\" album on Snapchat and the image \"depicted Thomas in his CCSO uniform, in the CCSO building, holding, touching his exposed penis,\" prosecutors reported.\nThe woman attempted to end her relationship with Thomas several times and, in response, according to court records, Thomas \"made verbal threats\" to her.\nIn August 2021, VICTIM I attempted to cease all contact with Thomas, prosecutors reported. After an interaction between VICTIM 1 and Thomas in October 2022, VICTIM I and others made complaints about Thomas to the CCSO, which spurred the internal investigation that resulted in agency officials suspending Thomas, according to prosecutors.\nIn late October 2022, Thomas learned that CCSO was investigating him and that VICTIM I had been interviewed by agency investigators and that \"a copy of the video that he shared with VICTIM I on Snapchat had been provided to the CCSO,\" according to prosecutors.\nIn response, Thomas contacted VICTIM I several times at her place of employment — a doctor's office — on two days in November 2022 and requested to make a complaint against her, prompting her to obtain a final peace order against him, prosecutors said.\nProsecutors reported that Thomas went to a Cecil County District Court commissioner and requested that VICTIM 1 be charged with sharing the \"video of Thomas in his uniform exposing his penis to her husband and Thomas' employer, the CCSO.\" VICTIM I had provided that video to CCSO in October 2022 while making her formal complaint against Thomas.\nThe Cecil County State's Attorney's Office, however, dismissed the charges that Thomas had filed against VICTIM I, prosecutors reported. The MOSP criminal information filed against Thomas accused Thomas of taking retaliatory action against VICTIM I.\nProsecutors reported that Thomas became \"engaged in a sexual relationship\" with a second woman in 2019 and that she ended their relationship in May, some four years later.\nThey further reported that, throughout their relationship, Thomas took videos and photos of himself and the woman engaged in sexual acts and that he took those images without her consent.\nThe woman tried to end their relationship several times and, in response, Thomas sent videos of himself and the woman engaged in sexual acts to her, prosecutors said. Thomas also threatened to send videos of the woman engaged in sexual acts to other individuals or post the videos online, prosecutors added.\nIn July 2022, VICTIM 2 told Thomas to delete the photos and videos that he had on his phone, according to prosecutors. But Thomas told VICTIM 2 that he couldn't because he was anxious to post them on social media someday \"maybe when you get pregnant or married,\" prosecutors reported.\nFrom April 2022 through January, Thomas sent dozens of videos of himself and VICTIM 2 engaged in sexual acts to other Snapchat users without VICTIM 2's consent or knowledge, according to prosecutors. Thomas asked random Snapchat users to watch the videos, prosecutors said. Thomas also paid several Snapchat users to watch the videos,\" prosecutors added.\nWhen the Cecil County Sheriff's Office suspended Thomas on Oct. 28, 2022, agency officials served him a non-contact order forbidding Thomas from interacting with several specified people involved in the administrative investigation, including the second woman, prosecutors reported. Thomas refused to sign the non-contact order, according to prosecutors.\nThomas contacted the second woman \"in person, through text messages and on social media applications, including Snapchat\" from Nov. 12, 2022 through May 4, 2023, prosecutors reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. labor secretary visits Cambridge oyster hatchery on workforce tour\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer came to Cambridge to tour Horn Point Oyster Hatchery as her Maryland stop on the Secretary's \"American at Work\" listening tour. She chose the hatchery to preview one of Maryland's \"most important\" industries.Maryland was Chaves-DeRemer's 36th stop on her U.S. tour that focuses on workforce investments.\nFor Manager of the UMCES Horn Point Laboratory Stephanie Alexander, the goals of the visit were to foster dialogue.\n\"She (the secretary) was very engaged in the tour. She grasped what we were doing, and I think she really understood that we were kind of here for the trifecta of the oyster, the commercial fishery, the private aquaculture sector, as well as the restoration sector,\" Alexander said.\nChavez-DeRemer chose the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery in Cambridge because aquaculture is \"an important industry here in the state of Maryland.\" She said the tour made her think not only of the science that goes into the oysters but the future of the industry.\n\"I asked a question in there: had they thought about 3D printing oyster shells? Now, why would I ask that question? I was in Japan for the World Fair just a few months ago, and they were 3D printing coral and reintroducing that back into the ocean and would reintegrate and grow new coral. So it's those kinds of questions that I think about. How can we best fortify the industry?\" Chaves-DeRemer said following the tour.\nShe said her goal is to complete the remaining 14 states by the first week of December in hopes to provide timely, actionable feedback to President Donald Trump within the first year of both of their terms.\nChavez-DeRemer said feedback from the tour will shape workforce programs and federal grant decisions. She said the Labor Department's focus on jobs and training reflects the administration's priorities of accountability, innovation and community strength.\nChaves-DeRemer emphasized the \"Make America Skilled Again\" grants, which are intended to flow to state and local partners and fund targeted workforce needs, including apprenticeships. The hatchery had one apprentice last cycle and aims for two more next year.\nAlexander said she personally funded the apprenticeship in the previous year and that it was nice to hear of other potential funding opportunities.\n\"My ideal apprentice would be somebody who has ties to the oyster industry, who is looking to do things different than what has historically been done. I think that would be amazing to foster connections, not only between the industry and our community, but the environment,\" Alexander said.\nWhen asked about how to stimulate the workforce amid federal budget cuts, Chaves-DeRemer said the department is focused on preventing waste, fraud and abuse, aligning with Trump's budget with economic goals, which were central to his campaign and the early months of his current term.\nShe said this is done through inter-agency collaboration via memorandum of understandings.\nThe federal administration says it is cutting waste by modernizing operations such as using technology like AI, streamlining compliance programs, and upgrading systems to prevent fraud and inefficiency.\n\"Two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business owner,\" Chaves-DeRemer said. \"So right here in Maryland, this industry is important. It's important to the ancillary jobs that it will affect. So the more we grow this economy, the better off and more prosperity we'll have.\"\nAlexander hopes there will be future collaboration with the Department of Labor to build a highly skilled workforce in Maryland, especially in Cambridge.\nChaves-DeRemer said she is committed to personally conveying state-level insights to the president and coordinating across agency leadership for implementation.\n\"You really cannot understand what's happening on the ground and how it affects the local economy, the everyday average worker in America, unless you can talk to them,\" she said. \"So I wouldn't know about this laboratory unless I'm here on site to hear these reports, to understand the lovely woman who gave me the tour. She started off as an intern and 29 years later, here she is, talking about why the oyster industry is so important.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But new members won election to the county seat later that year, and they reversed approval of the development.\nWaterman and Queenstown fought the reversal but ultimately lost in court, with the Maryland Court of Appeals enforcing a five-year stay on the zoning of the property.\nWhen those five years were up in November 2019, the development proposal moved forward introducing concept plans and architectural guidelines in 2020.\nThe master concept plan approved by Queenstown in 2021, showed no strong opposition to it from local residents.\nPublic hearings were held after planning commission members found the master concept plan consistent with the town comprehensive plan.\nDuring those hearings in 2021, Barry Waterman, the proprietor of Waterman Family Limited Partnership, the property owners, told the commissioners, homes will vary in size but will resemble the historic architecture of Queenstown.\nMore discussion and potential agreement approval is expected at the commissioner's next meeting March 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Koenig paid a surprise visit to St. Elizabeth of Hungary Roman Catholic Church the first Sunday of Advent, Dec. 3.It was the bishop's first visit to the church in Denton, which is part of the Caroline County parish that includes St. Benedict Church in Ridgely.\nKoenig is bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington, comprising Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nKoenig preached the homily and celebrated Holy Communion with the Rev. Christopher Coffiey and Deacon Bill Nickum of Denton. He reminded the congregation who filled the sanctuary that Advent is a time of \"longing for a savior.\"\nHe shared the story of Saint John Paul II, who visited his native Poland shortly after he was elected pope in 1979.\nAs Pope John Paul II \"offered Mass in Warsaw, there were 300,000 people who attended that Mass, and there were millions who were watching on TV in Poland, as well as the other Eastern European countries,\" Koenig said.\n\"He spoke about the faith of the Polish people and their desire for freedom,\" Koenig said. As the pope preached, a threeword chant arose from the crowd, first quietly, then increasingly louder.\nThe chant \"wasn't 'Communists, go home,' it was, 'We want God, we want God,\" Koenig said. \"They knew that they needed a savior.\"\n\"They knew that that Savior was the one who was going to free them from the tyranny of Communist atheism, that the Savior had come to set us free,\" he said.\n\"As we begin the season of Advent, may we open our hearts up by first acknowledging and growing in the awareness of our need for a Savior, a Savior who wants us as much as we want him.\"\nThe Rev. Christopher Coffiey, pastor of St. Benedict-St. Elizabeth parish thanked the bishop for visiting, recalling that he had mentioned to Koenig a few months earlier that he had not yet visited St.\nElizabeth's, and Koenig answered, \"Well, one day I might shock you, and I might come.\"\n\"So I think the bishop really fulfilled the Gospel today, which says, 'Ye not know the day nor the hour,'\" Coffiey quipped as the congregation laughed. \n \n Caption: The Most Reverent William Koenig, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington, center, visits St. Elizabeth of Hungary Roman Catholic Church the first Sunday of Advent Dec. 3.\n\n Flanking him are Deacon Bill Nickum, left, and the Rev.

She previously worked at Caroline County Public Schools in various teacher and administrative roles for a combined 36 years, retiring in 2009.\n\"I can promise you as president of your board, I will do the very best that I can do,\" Wayman said during Tuesday evening's meeting.\nBartz nominated Mark Jones to once again serve as vice president of the board alongside Weaver. All five members voted in favor.\nBartz, who was appointed in June to the Board of Education, ran unopposed in District 1. She is the director of community based programs at Choptank Community Health, overseeing the school-based health centers and serving as a provider at Greensboro Elementary.\nIn an interview, she said she's \"excited\" about the district's direction, particularly the fact that eight of nine schools are designated community schools by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\n\"In a county that's rural, it is really important that we recognize that our schools really are hubs in our community and that we can bring a lot of resources to families and kids alongside of the education that they receive in those buildings,\" Bartz said. \"It's a safe place for families.\"\nAssuming outgoing President Richard Barton's District 2 seat is Johnson, who also ran unopposed. In an interview with the Star Democrat, Johnson said she's looking forward to the new role.\nAt first, she was hesitant about running, but the idea grew over time as she thought about her 11- and 14-year-old daughters, who both attend Caroline County schools. She said it's a great way to be a part of \"conversations that can make change.\"\n\"When you're a parent sitting on the outside, you hear all of these things, and they may not necessarily make sense to you as a parent,\" Johnson said. \"People get in their emotions and they run with that. But I'm that type of person that I want to know why, and I'm going to go straight to the source to figure that answer out.\"\nJohnson is the executive director of the His Hope Ministries shelter in Denton and a board member for the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce.\n\"There's still parts of Caroline County that I haven't gotten to see or be connected with,\" Johnson said, \"so I'm really excited to be able to go to different parts of the county and just see what's happening, see what schools are doing.\"\nThis report has been updated to correct the spelling of Michele Wayman's name. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bobby grew up working on their family farm until he graduated from high school, and his father sold the home farm.Bobby went to work after graduation, he worked at several different jobs, working on a farm in Queenstown that raised hogs, Wye Mills grain, as a equipment mechanic, at John Deere as an equipment manager, drove a truck, worked as a marine pile driver all while helping his uncle farm part-time.Bobby remembers working with mules pulling a walking cultivator, when they did purchase a tractor, they had no cabs.\"Working on tractors with no cabs was terrible, you would get off the tractor and your face would be covered in dirt,\" Bobby said.Connie's family, the Richard sons, owned their family farm near Conquest beach since the 1900s. Connie was the oldest of three children, she had to help her mother with turkeys. Her mother raised around 500 turkeys which helped with extra family income. Connie had to shoot predators and keep the turkeys safe. She helped feed them and when the turkeys were big enough Connie would help dress them and her mother would take them to Baltimore and PA to sell.When Connie's mother was traveling to sell her turkeys, it was Connie's job to take care of her younger siblings along with working on the farm.Bobby remembers seeing Connie as a teenager, he asked his good friend Charles Haymaker, \"Who is that?\" Charles told him Connie was out of his league. Charles bet Bobby $5, which was a lot of money, at that time, he couldn't get a date with Connie. After a couple of months of asking they finally went on a date to the Church Hill drive-in movies. As both Bobby and Connie said, \"The rest is history.\" They got married in 1955, they just celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary.They were blessed with three children, Marion, Robbie and Lynn. Bobby was an only child just like his father, when Bobby called his mother to tell her Lynn was born, she thought Bobby was lying. Lynn was the first girl in six generations to be born into the Wilson family. They moved six times during their marriage and never once moved out of Queen Anne's County.Bobby and Connie purchased \"Shell cross Farm\", in 1971 from his grandmother and returned to farming full time. The name \"Shell cross Farm\" had morphed over the years from \"Shall Cross Farm\" to \"Shell cross Farm.\" Bobby and his son, Marion, raised swine for 10 years and at their peak farmed around 2,500 acres of land.During the same time that Bobby was farming full time Connie had her own cosmetology business for 22 years.Connie would attend to University of Maryland in College Park for a period of seven years to get her cosmetology degree. After she would finish her classes in College Park she would come home and work ground and plant in the evenings.She began her teaching career at the Queen Anne's County High School, it was supposed to be for a year or two and after 27 years she finally retired.Connie would plant, take care of her kids as well as bringing meals to Bobby in the field.\"There is always something to do on the farm,\" Connie smiled.Bobby and Connie's grandson, Marion, started working on the farm at age 14, he always knew he wanted to farm. Bobby and Connie both told Marion he can work on the farm full time after graduation with one stipulation, he had to go to college. Marion was reluctant, however, he said \"it was the best thing he did.\" College taught him how manage a business and interact with people in the ag community. Marion and his wife Amy purchased Shell cross farms in 2013 and moved to the farm in 2016.In 2000, the farming operation was turned over to Marion and Amy full time. Marion had been his grandfather's shadow since he was 5 years old.\"I got my work ethic and experience from Pop and Mom-Mom,\" he said. \"She taught me how to drive the tractors on the farm. That was her job to drive tractors while Pop was away doing his community service.\" Bobby and Connie both set an example of giving back to the community.Bobby has been on the local and State Farm Bureau board, served on the local and State Soil Conservation District Board for 31 years, he was the state President for Maryland Farm Bureau and Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts, Queen Anne's County Lions Club, Jaycees, served in the Army National Guard for 12 years, served on the board of Centreville United Methodist Church, volunteered at the Queen Anne's County Fair cooking barbeque chicken for at least 25 years with Paul Gunther.Connie, as well, has given back to the community being the class adviser at Queen Anne's County High School, Vocational Industries Clubs of America (VICA) for 16 years, 4-H Club leader, Boy and Girl Scout leader, Maryland Agricultural Education Foundation board member, Junior Women's Club member who sponsored a fair every year to provide free kindergarten classes for 10 years prior to Kindergarten being a part of the school curriculum.They would have booths to raise money and each year a new booth was added to make sure sufficient funding for kindergarten was provided for the children in the county.When asked, Bobby said, \"one of his favorite jobs was working as the service manager for John Deere.\" He liked managing the 10 men under him. He and Connie mentioned before they had irrigation \"Mother Nature isn't always so kind to farmers and that was the hardest part of farming. Not knowing if you're going to get the rain you need to grow a crop.\" The Wilsons want to be remembered for their family heritage and what they have contributed to the ag community.Their five grandchildren are a source of joy for them and their great-grandchildren growing up on the farm and showing interest in the family farm is gratifying.Their great-grandchildren, Colton and Ellie, both acknowledge that their great-grandparents are modest in what they say they have done in their lifetimes. One thing is for sure they have passed their farm family heritage through more than five generations. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nThe Wilson family includes, back row, Ellie Wilson, Marion Wilson, Amy Wilson and Colton Wilson.

We don't want to make the next pass. We had many opportunities but we don't pass the ball. We don't want to move the ball. And we all want to sit and watch two players do it. We have to be better.\"\nWolters acknowledged he did see some good things in the first half, as the Sabres (2-5) had four different players score while building a 4-0 lead after the first quarter.\nRardin, who scored three goals in each half, scored from close range 2 minutes, 38 seconds into the game. Less than a minute later, Grant Messick (two goals) beat Lions goalie Brian Maleski low. A little over 2 minutes after that, Noah Zimmerman (three assists) zipped a pinpoint pass to a cutting Liam Durnbaugh, who neatly flipped the ball over his shoulder for a 3-0 lead. Mason Roland capped the opening flurry by converting a Durnbaugh pass for a goal.\n\"A lot of this roster is back,\" Queen Anne's head coach Brad Niesz said of Sts. Peter & Paul, which reached the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference final last year. \"And I know a lot of them are juniors, and even sophomores, but they've played a year or two together. We're still working on that chemistry, especially on our defensive end. We've had a lot of guys step up in roles that are more significant than I guess they've played in the past, and now it's their time to be the man.\n\"On the offensive side, I think with them scoring a couple of goals out of the gate, I felt like we got a little bit rushed,\" Niesz continued. \"There's a lot of things that we're really good at that we didn't necessarily do today.\"\nTyler Crist veered in from the left and, while falling forward, put the Lions' first goal of the season past Sabres goalie Hank Wolters (nine saves) early in the second quarter.\nBut Sts. Peter & Paul answered with four more goals. Zimmerman scored to restore the four-goal edge with 9:37 left in the first half. Durnbaugh patiently waited before finding Messick for a goal and a 4-1 lead with under 5 minutes to go. Rardin added two more, curling in from the right side and slipping a goal inside the post before ripping another one on a tough angle from left wing.\n\"The first half wasn't horrible,\" Coach Wolters said.\nDurnbaugh notched his second goal early in the third quarter, and Zimmerman assisted on Rardin's fourth goal, fattening the Sabres' lead to 10-1 heading in the fourth quarter.\nRardin somehow came open out front, snagged a Zimmerman feed and sent a sidewinder past Maleski for an 11-1 lead with 31 seconds gone in the fourth quarter.\nBut Sam Yetman scored twice in less than a minute, and, after Rardin netted his sixth goal, Jamison Kendall beat Sabres backup goalie Jaxson Usilton.\n\"They're kids hustled,\" Coach Wolters said of Queen Anne's. \"They may not be the most talented but they played hard. They really did. And they never gave up. They never quit and I respect that.\n\"It's a win,\" the Sabres head coach added. \"And it was a home win. It was never in doubt. But there's a lot of work to do. And they'll bounce back. But we're not playing good fundamental lacrosse. I'm not saying we have to be perfectionists, but this wasn't good lacrosse. We got to start picking up and playing smarter, playing in control. We're going to be fine. But that was not a really good job today.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Ben Cardin will attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly.Cardin, a Democrat, will travel to New York this weekend as a representative of the United States to the U.N. to meet with world leaders, the senator said in an interview Tuesday with Capital News Service.\nCardin said his message to the General Assembly will include \"support for Ukraine, put a spotlight on the Sudan — the tragedies that are taking place there — and to try to find a way in which we can move towards the hostage release, cease-fire and peace in the Middle East.\"\n\"We know it's an incredible opportunity, in regards to Ukraine, we're gonna have this week, and I expect to use that,\" Cardin said.\nPresident Joe Biden announced his nominations for U.S. representatives to the U.N. on Sept. 9. Along with Cardin, Biden nominated Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, former Biden-Harris campaign official Tanya Leigh Flores and Michael Trager, vice chairman of the State Department's Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board.\n\"Currently serving as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Cardin has worked across party lines to further U.S. national security and to ensure that democracy, anti-corruption, transparency, good governance and respect for civil and human rights are integrated into American actions at home and abroad,\" the White House said in a statement.\nCardin served as a U.S. representative to the U.N. General Assembly in 2014 after being nominated by President Barack Obama.\nThe assembly opened on Sept. 10 and will continue until Sept. 28, with meetings among high-level government officials beginning on Tuesday. The General Assembly convenes once a year, and this year's theme is \"Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.\"\nMember states at the assembly will discuss a variety of issues, from rising sea levels to artificial intelligence and equitable financing for low-income countries.\n\"I'm honored to have President Biden's trust to represent our country at the United Nations General Assembly,\" Cardin said in a tweet on Sept. 10. \"Looking forward to productive, unifying conversations.\"\nThe Senate has yet to vote to confirm the U.N. nominations but Cardin said his responsibilities were not \"terribly contingent upon confirmation,\" so he can join the delegation.\n\"I have my credentials as United States senator, chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\" he said. \"There's not any official action I will take, because I'm a member of our delegation. It's just to work with our delegation. I don't have to give up my day job.\"\nBiden has addressed the UN each fall of his presidency, and Cardin expects him to address the body again next week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ovechkin's role-model career goes beyond Washington and Russia\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Logan Cooley was born in Pittsburgh just 17 months before Sidney Crosby debuted in the NHL and his hometown Penguins won multiple Stanley Cup championships during his childhood.Cooley admired Crosby, but he grew up a Washington Capitals fan for a very specific reason: Alex Ovechkin.\n\"That's the real one,\" said Cooley, who's now playing for the Utah Hockey Club. \"He was my favorite player growing up.\"\nCooley is not alone. Ovechkin has for two decades been a role model for kids watching hockey all around the world, from his homeland in Russia to the U.S. and Canada, thanks to his powerful slap shot and physical style of play, his familiar yellow skate laces and tinted visor, and that gap-toothed smile. He is one of the most recognizable faces of the sport.\nNow closing in on Wayne Gretzky's career goals record, the 39-year-old Ovechkin is now playing against many of those youngsters who grew up watching his highlights and hoping they could be like the \"Great 8.\"\n\"I had Ovechkin jerseys, and everyone did. Who didn't?\" U.S.-born defenseman Brock Faber of the Minnesota Wild said. \"Everyone always wanted to be Ovi. ... When he was younger in his career and the yellow laces and just the style and swag he brought to the game, being so loved around the league, it's one of the coolest things in the world to play against guys like him.\"\nThe admiration starts at home, from players who were years or decades from putting on skates when Ovechkin was born in Moscow on Sept. 17, 1985. Ivan Miroshnichenko, Washington's first-round pick in 2022 who has been a teammate for 40 NHL games, said: \"He's a big, Russian man. He's a legend.\"\nThat legend started early. Dmitry Kulikov of the Florida Panthers recently played in his 1,000th regular-season NHL game and is just five years younger than Ovechkin, but he recalls the buzz beginning in the '90s.\n\"When I was growing up, he was obviously just starting off a few years before me and he was already talked about being great back then,\" Kulikov said. \"Obviously when he came over here, he proved it with his style of play and his goal-scoring ability, how unique of a player he is and how good he was going to be.\"\nHow unique? Ovechkin is not only second all time to Gretzky with 879 goals and holds the record for the most on the power play and most shots, but his 3,701 hits rank third among all players over the past 20 seasons. During that time, he won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year, the Hart three times as league MVP and the Conn Smythe in 2018 as playoff MVP after leading the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup title.\nSlightly younger but still with more than 750 games in North America, Winnipeg winger and fellow Russian Vladislav Namestnikov considers Ovechkin a part of multiple iterations of his career.\n\"I just grew up watching him, an idol growing up,\" Namestnikov said. \"Our generation, he opened up the doors for everyone else.\"\nWyatt Johnston was still in diapers growing up in Toronto when Ovechkin and Crosby — picked No. 1 in the NHL draft a year apart — became hockey's biggest stars.\n\"They've dominated the league for as long as I've lived,\" said Johnston, who entered NHL with Dallas in 2022. \"(Ovechkin) was a really fun player to watch, just how dynamic he is. He's one of those guys that I think him and Sid are maybe on a different level of me being kind of starstruck when I've seen them just kind of growing up, and they were dominating the league for my whole life.\"\nFaber credited Ovechkin and Crosby for paving the way for so many players. And that doesn't just include from places like the U.S. and Canada. Florida defenseman Niko Mikkola grew up in the outskirts of Oulu, Finland, across the Gulf of Bothnia from Sweden and was locked in to that rivalry.\n\"Obviously you know those two big names were Crosby and Ovechkin,\" Mikkola said. \"You followed those guys, obviously, and you see in headlines those guys are usually there. The highlights, also, you see how they score goals.\"\nNow teammates with Mikkola with the Panthers, Nate Schmidt still considers himself lucky to play his first four NHL seasons alongside Ovechkin with the Capitals. That's full circle for a kid who grew up in Minnesota playing minor and high school hockey watching Ovechkin wide-eyed at what he could do.\n\"It's hard not to,\" Schmidt said. \"Being his teammate and seeing what he does in practice and games firsthand gives you a different appreciation for what he is as a player.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'To save lives, break the silence': Speakers share suicide prevention experiences\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 662\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The aim of the day was pretty basic — \"to save lives, break the silence and remind every person that hope is within reach.\"The Southern Maryland Suicide Prevention Summit, a four-hour session, was a way to share strategies to stop someone from ending his or her life.\nHosted by Unstoppable You Ministries Inc., the event was held Sept. 27 at University System of Maryland's Southern Maryland location in California.\nThe ministry's founder, Jennifer Foxworthy, said her organization provides services to deal with the impacts of homelessness, human trafficking and domestic violence, noting that \"suicide\" is a looming demon in all of those adverse situations.\nTo the attendees of the event, which was free to the public, Foxworthy warned \"some parts of the presentation may be heavy.\"\nThe event's two keynote speakers, in fact, articulated the gravity of the issue in their brief presentations.\nKim Klump's story was about her son, Jesse, a senior at Snow Hill High School on Maryland's Eastern Shore who died by his own hand in 2009. Klump noted Jesse was an athlete, scholar and student leader.\n\"This is not someone you would expect would take his life,\" she said.\nKlump admitted that \"in hindsight\" she saw signs that her son was consumed with \"depression.\"\n\"He gave precious possessions away,\" Klump recalled.\nHer son also kept a journal, which was found later and revealed some of his anxieties of the present and future.\nSince her son was an avid kayaker and had worked at The Pocomoke Canoe Company, Klump and others organized a fundraiser called \"Jesse's Paddle,\" which raises funds for scholarships in his memory.\nKlump said that while the fundraiser is a good way to keep her son's memory alive, she decided it wasn't enough. That's when she decided to start a prevention program in schools.\nIn addition to teaching coping skills, the Jesse Klump Suicide and Awareness Program started an open conversation.\n\"Every conversation has the power to make a difference,\" Klump said.\nLast school year the awareness program visited four high schools and saw nearly 1,500 school students. This past summer the program hosted a \"summer eco-therapy camp,\" which included such challenging activities as kayaking, canoeing and rope-climbing.\nKlump said the organization uses grant funding to fund its programs.\nPressures of serving the nation\nThe summit's second keynoter, Navy Capt. Byron Lee, began his talk on a light-hearted note, passing a beach ball to attendees and engaging them in a game of \"bump, bump, catch.\"\n\"We all react to things differently,\" Lee told the audience, adding that things that bring stress into people's lives aren't much different than the things that make people happy.\nLee's jovial demeanor turned emotional when he revealed that at one point in his 28-year armed forces career he had considered taking his own life.\n\"Nothing looked positive, nobody knew,\" Lee said.\nHe was able to get help on the base he was assigned to from a mental health expert.\nLee said that with its pressures to be ready to react and serve as a protector, while dealing with the pressures of assignment moves, raising a family and maintaining personal health, members of the military are emotionally vulnerable.\n\"All of those things were weighing on me,\" he said.\nLee provided 2023 statistics from the U.S. Department of Defense (now the Department of War) that showed that year there were 523 suicides in the nation's military, which was 9% higher than the previous year. The data also showed firearms were the primary method for carrying out a suicide.\nIn noting her own prior experience in the armed forces, Foxworthy said, \"We may look big and strong but we often suffer in silence. It's important to know your resources.\"\nNearly 20 vendors participated in the summit, including the health departments of all three Southern Maryland counties, the Maryland Department of Health Behavioral Health Administration, service members, veterans and their families, as well as the Charles County Center for Children and Community Crisis Services Inc.\nFor more information about Unstoppable You Ministries, go to www.unstoppableyouministries.org.\nFor immediate, confidential mental health support, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton passes ordinance to mitigate seafood processing odors\n\n December 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 577\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Easton Town Council approved an ordinance Monday that aims to crack down on odors from seafood processors by requiring the installment of odor control technology.In a 4-0 vote, the town passed Ordinance 835, which was drafted following resident concerns about the odor emanating from Chesapeake Brand Seafood on Maryland Avenue.\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis was outspoken Monday evening about bringing his constituents relief from the odors they smell during crab season.\n\"Constituents in the neighborhood should not have to go through another season of having to endure that kind of odor,\" Davis said. \"And if the business is friendly and working with the community, something of this nature should have been worked out prior to now.\"\nThe ordinance, which will go into effect later this month, requires that seafood processing operations install odor control technology \"in such a manner that no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building on the same property or on adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nZach Smith, an attorney representing Chesapeake Brand Seafood, said the business' concerns center the spray application system it plans to install — which will cost around $20,000 and may not fulfill the town's new requirements of \"no odor\" being detectable.\n\"We're confident it will address the issue, at least to some extent,\" Smith said. \"But we're not confident, not necessarily confident, it'll meet that standard.\"\nSmith requested a compromise, stating he thinks the ordinance should not retroactively apply to \"existing, lawful seafood processing uses\" such as his client. He submitted proposed revisions to the ordinance that were read aloud Monday evening.\nFollowing a lengthy council discussion, Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said he was ready to pass the ordinance as written, without Smith's proposed changes. Council President Frank Gunsallus agreed those changes were \"overly specific.\"\nAbatiello made a motion to approve the ordinance, which was seconded by Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry. Gunsallus and Davis joined in voting yes. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nTIMELINE DEBATEIn the approved ordinance, businesses must comply with odor control and storage requirements by July 1, 2025. Prior to Monday, the compliance date on the draft ordinance was Jan. 1, 2026. The change stirred discussion Monday evening.\nDavis pushed for that date to be even sooner — Jan. 1, 2025 — though he was outnumbered by Gunsallus, Abatiello, and Curry, who all voted in favor of amending the ordinance to the July date.\nCurry maintained that it's important the town be fair to the business since it's planning to pay up for the new odor control system to address the problem.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said she had legal concerns about shortening the period, saying that \"even January (2026)\" is pushing it.\n\"They've had time to comply,\" Davis said.\n\"But they didn't have this ordinance,\" VanEmburgh responded. \"The ordinance is what would be challenged.\"\n\"I mean the worst case scenario is that we go to court, and is that the end result? Then so be it,\" said Davis. \" … If you say comply by 2026, just think about this for a moment. The same people who live in Ward 4 have to suffer through this this year again until January 2026.\"\n\"I have to stand on what I believe in, and I believe that they've already had enough time to do it,\" Davis later stated. \"It seems to me that we're more worried about going to court than listening to the people. And I think we should listen to the people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In addition, local health departments will host listening sessions to understand community needs and solicit ideas and recommendations. Feedback on the program will close on Sept. 30.\nThe program will provide $50 billion to 50 states over the course of five years. Maryland is projected to see $100 million of those funds. However, the state still needs to apply for the program in order to receive the money.\nHalf of those funds will be distributed based on rurality, quality of the application and state policy, while the other half will be distributed equally among all states upon approved applications, according to Maryland Department of Health's website. Once applications are approved, funds will be distributed from 2026 to 2030.\nThe strategic goals of the program are prevention and management of chronic disease, behavioral health, sustainable access, workforce development, innovative care and tech innovation.\nThe dates of the listening sessions can be found at health.maryland.gov, and questions regarding the process or feedback on the program can be sent to mdh.transformruralhealth@maryland.gov. There is also an option to mail in responses on the website. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Ward 4 candidates talk property taxes, housing\n\n April 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Candidates for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council have offered varying opinions on the town's property tax rate.Incumbent the Rev. Elmer Davis, Moonyene Jackson-Amis and Cameron Keefe are squaring off in the town's election May 6. Each discussed their views on property taxes, housing and more in interviews with The Star Democrat's editorial board last week.\nCurrently, the town levies a tax on real property at 52 cents per $100 of assessed value. That mark hasn't changed since 2008. It's higher than Talbot County's other towns, but relatively low compared to Eastern Shore towns such as Cambridge, Denton and Salisbury.\nProperty values, though, have increased significantly in recent years. The state's 2025 reassessments showed the value of Group 1 residential and commercial properties in Talbot County increased by 22.1% from 2022. The town's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget projects $13.6 million in real property tax revenue, slightly up from last year. It was a tight and \"lean\" budget, Mayor Megan Cook has said.\nDavis, who's been on the council since 2020, said the property tax rate should be increased.\n\"I think the mayor's playing around a little bit. … They're not fiscally responsible,\" Davis said. \"We have not raised taxes, and here's the problem. We got that COVID money. We've been living high on the hog, and now we have to pay the piper.\"\nJackson-Amis, Ward 4's representative from 2001 to 2008, says the Town Council should have conversations with professionals about potential tax breaks.\n\"I think the property tax is a little steep,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"It seems like the idea is to get, to have a money funnel. A funnel as opposed to exacting what's necessary to support the budget.\"\nKeefe in his interview emphasized fiscal responsibility, while adding he understands new initiatives cost money.\n\"They make a lot of decisions that don't affect their wealth, but it affects everybody else's wealth,\" Keefe said of the council. \" ... We need to dismantle this ivory tower thing.\"\nHOUSING\nThe Ward 4 hopefuls each touched on plans to improve Easton's affordable housing stock. Keefe said \"we need to make Easton not just survivable, but livable.\"\n\"We can say all the buzz words we want, but I would love to see specifically starter homes in Easton, things that draw young families here,\" Keefe said.\nHe said he hopes to sit down with town planners to discuss their proposed inclusionary zoning ordinance that would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable.\nJackson-Amis says she's \"all for inclusionary zoning.\" She hopes to revisit the requirement that developers include 25% low or middle-income units in projects, an effort she supported in her prior stint on the council.\n\"If you're getting a benefit from the town, we need to be able to exact a benefit from you,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"If you're creating housing, we ought to know what our housing needs are, and that it shouldn't just be for the financial gain of wealthy people.\"\nDavis said he's \"not 100% sure\" current housing legislation in the works will answer all of Easton's housing needs. He advocated for the town to buy a piece of land and work with nonprofits.\n\"The town should buy a piece of land,\" Davis said. \"And the town should partner with Habitat (for Humanity) or some other organization to … ensure that we deal holistically with the person and the property.\"\nEXPERIENCE\nThe Ward 4 candidates bring different experience levels to the table.\nDavis, 58, said he focused on constituent representation during his time on the council, such as when he supported a seafood odor ordinance last year.\n\"I'm in the position as the council member because of the people,\" he said. \"I represent those individuals in my ward. I'm not the end-all, be-all. So if my constituents say that this is what they want, then I represent them well.\"\nJackson-Amis, 77, said \"we should look toward wisdom.\"\n\"Right now you need people with some seasoned ability to ferret out issues and help bring solutions to problems,\" she said. \"So I don't think age really should be that important, but I think the experience is what should matter.\"\nKeefe, 25, said he wants more youth involvement in the town.\n\"I know I'm young. That is by no means any reason to take this lightly,\" Keefe said. \"I think this is important. I think there's a lot of potential for good that can happen from this. And above all of those things, I want to be a representative who listens.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The carousel is operated by the Smithsonian Enterprises, a division of the Smithsonian Institution; the National Mall is administered by the National Park Service.The carousel will be repaired and refurbished to its original grandeur, and the updated infrastructure will not alter the carousel's appearance.A carousel was first installed on the National Mall in 1967 when then-Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley wanted to enliven th e Mall as a \"living extension\" of the museums. The original carousel was replaced in 1981 with the current carousel.Built in 1947, the current carousel was first operated in Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Baltimore. The amusement park became the focus of desegregation activists in the Baltimore area during the Civil Rights Movement. After years of protest, the park and carousel were desegregated Aug. 28, 1963, the day of the historic March on Washington.For many years, a small family company owned and operated the carousel as a concession for Smithsonian Enterprises. The Smithsonian purchased it in December 2022.The carousel will be shipped to Carousels and Carvings in Marion, Ohio, where the animals and structure will be repaired and refurbished to their original appearances.In addition, the carousel's electrical connections and paving will also be updated to ensure safe operation once the carousel returns to the National Mall. It will be up and running at the same location for the United States' 250th anniversary celebration in 2026. \n \n Caption: SMITHSONIAN PHOTO BY CASEY MCADAMS\n \nThe carousel on the National Mall will be removed later this year for renovations. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with the Delmarva Pride Center, the event was hosted by DoCo Pride and the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus.\nThe four-person panel — which included Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), Fair's Chief of Staff Camila Reynolds-Dominguez, FreeState Justice Executive Director Phillip Westry and Maryland Office of the Attorney General Civil Rights Division Chief Jonathan Smith — answered questions related to schools and workplace, health care and family law.\nCaleb Holland, an attorney and the chair of DoCo Pride, who moderated the town hall, said the goal of the event is \"to prepare, not scare.\"\nOn the topic of education, Smith said he expects the Trump administration will try to push through executive orders around funding schools that are based on sports issues, bathrooms or the ability to deadname or misgender students. But Smith said there are \"very significant responses\" states can make.\n\"There's been a body of law that's developed that says the United States government cannot, through its funding powers, coerce states to take policy decisions that are not for the function of funding,\" he said.\nWestry said organizing and getting active in politics, like school boards, is a good way to get involved.\nAlthough part of Wednesday night's conversation focused on bracing for what could happen in the country, the panelists also talked about what gives them hope.\nFair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, recalled the 2018 midterm elections. He said the country elected more women, more queer people and more people of color than ever before.\n\"In 2018, we figured out that in order to protect our rights, we need to do everything we can to put as many people who look like us into positions of power,\" he said. \"What I am hopeful for is that 2026 looks just like that.\"\nReynolds-Dominguez, who was previously a policy advocate and legal impact coordinator at FreeState Justice, said that in the last couple of years, the state has taken an \"aggressive stance\" on doing everything possible to anticipate rollbacks. She said Maryland is \"situated to weather this storm\" and that should be used as a catalyst for doing long-term work.\n\"The core of all of this is shifting people's hearts and minds,\" she said. \"And if we're not doing that work, we're spending our time in the wrong place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Together, we can foster growth and nurture the next generation of Main Street leaders, paving the way for vibrant downtowns and thriving communities.\"\nDeKarske said at a town meeting in March that the town sent a request for proposal to the state in hopes of being chosen as the conference's host.\n\"You need to make sure you have enough hotel rooms and places for them to eat because they have you go back out to town over those two days,\" DeKarske said in March. \" ... It's a really good opportunity for us.\"\nIn 2024, Frederick hosted the inaugural Maryland Main Street Conference, which was a one-day event attended by more than 400 people.\nDay said in a press release the conference is an opportunity for economic developers to learn how best to invest in Maryland's historic centers.\n\"The Town of Easton is a prime example of the payoff of that investment, and I'm so excited to recognize them as the host of this year's conference,\" Day stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The bull came out victorious each time.\nMany of the top competitors were focused on qualifying for the American Professional Rodeo Association finals this November. Announcer Ty Miller said some competitors have sights set on the International Finals Rodeo in January.\n\"The road to the IFR runs right through Greensboro, Maryland,\" Miller enthusiastically announced to a crowd of hundreds.\nYvette Lavalette, from Felton, Delaware, has been participating in rodeos for around eight years. She said her favorite part of the rodeo is the crowd.\nLavalette saved her 6-year-old horse, named Dancing In The Sky, from a kill pen in Texas. It's named in honor of her late friend's favorite song, as Lavalette's friend died the day she got the horse.\nSome riders came from hours away, while others lived in or near Greensboro. Audience members came from states such as New York, Kentucky and neighboring Delaware to enjoy the festivities.\nA few riders, like Cali Jackson, competed in multiple events during the weekend. Jackson, who is from Greensboro, competed in breakaway riding and barrel racing.\nTara Gale, who is from New Jersey, has been competing for around 20 years. She finished third and fourth, respectively, in breakaway roping on the two nights. She roped her calf in 3.5 seconds on Friday and 3.9 seconds on Saturday.\nShe emphasized that the thrill of rodeo has kept her going for years. \"It's like a gambling addiction,\" Gale said.\nThe rodeo was sponsored by the Fred Frederick Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram dealership in Easton. Fletch Gowen, the general sales manager, said it's an event that perfectly fits the Greensboro community.\n\"The best part is seeing something that's not been around this area over the last few years really grow,\" Gowen said. \"Something new for people to go to. We live in a small town, there's not a lot of things to see. Only so many carnivals and different things you can have, so something unique like this to have is pretty cool.\"\nGowen was pleased with a packed crowd on Friday night and believes that the event is trending upwards.\n\"They tend to grow,\" Gowen said. \"(It) takes a few years to get them completely growing. Last year, we had a phenomenal first-night turnout, (and) got a good turnout tonight.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline commissioners hear options for landfill after 2030\n\n April 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Caroline County could remain the host of the regional landfill for 12 years longer than originally planned.At a Caroline County Commissioners meeting Tuesday morning, Queen Anne's County Administrator Todd Mohn, CPA and Queen Anne's County Consultant Joe Zimmerman and Queen Anne's County Commissioner James Moran came to speak about the possibility of using the Mid-Shore II Regional Landfill in Ridgely through 2042 rather than building a new landfill in Queen Anne's County for 2031.\nDuring their presentation, Mohn said Maryland Environmental Service has been working with county administrators to evaluate the future of Mid-Shore II, and it has concluded that the landfill could \"easily provide service\" to the citizens of the region through approximately 2042.\nThe Mid-Shore II landfill, which was opened in 2011, provides services to Talbot, Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent counties.\nMohn explained that in the late 1980s, due to new federal regulations, the counties had to close their landfills and and replace them with new landfills. In response to this new regulation, Talbot, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties engaged with MES to form a partnership where each county would take turns hosting a landfill for a 20-year term. Kent County later joined that partnership.\nCaroline County is hosting the current landfill and, under the original arrangement, would be off the hook at the end of 2030 when Queen Anne's County would take over the responsibility of host. However, if the partnering counties agreed, they could instead extend the lifetime of Caroline County's landfill.\nDuring the presentation, Mohn listed reasons why Queen Anne's County feels this option makes sense. For Caroline County, he said that this option would provide economic stability for Ridgely businesses and that the county would get a host fee for the extension of service.\nHe said the option would also maximize the value of public infrastructure, defer liability for debt to construct a new landfill, maintain shorter haul routes for Talbot County and avoid the cost of a transfer operation.\nMoran said landfills are at a premium.\n\"We want to maximize that,\" he said about the space in each landfill. \"And if this (provides) us with an extra 30 years of life that we didn't have coming into this 80-year deal, then that's a good thing for the environment, it's a good thing for the Eastern Shore.\"\nIf this proposal moves forward, all of the partnering counties would need to come to an agreement on a modified arrangement, including the host fee for Caroline County.\nAt the meeting, Zimmerman presented three options for host fees and annual tipping fee increases for the Mid-Shore II landfill:\nA host fee of $2 per ton of waste growing to $4 after 2031 with an annual increase of 1.15% in tipping fees.A host fee of $3 per ton of waste growing to $5 after 2031 with an annual increase of 1.35% in tipping fees.A host fee of $4 per ton of waste growing to $6 after 2031 with an annual increase of 1.5% in tipping fees.\n\"We think these are achievable options,\" Zimmerman said about the three options. \"It's really the question of how much risk the counties want to take on in terms of their competitive posture.\"\nHe said that historically, tipping fees have, on average, annually increased by 1.42%.\nCaroline County Commission President Travis Breeding said he has made it clear to MES that he agrees with keeping the landfill operating in Caroline County for environmental and economic reasons, but he would like to make sure the county retains \"any of the savings associated with the extension of the landfill.\"\nHe said the county's residents are the ones burdened with the affects of the landfill operations, including truck traffic and bad smells from time to time.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter spoke about the impact of MES operations on the county.\nHe said that although this proposal is an opportunity to generate more revenue without raising property taxes, having the landfill in the county has affected the condition of the roads where trash is being driven, including trash left on those roads. He said the extension of the landfill's services would be a hard sell to the public.\n\"For me, anything that we do is going to have to involve MES stepping up to the plate and fulfilling what I think the obligations and responsibilities are,\" he said, adding that roads would be part of that obligation, in his mind.\nPorter asked the presenters if it appears that the other partnering counties are on board with keeping the landfill in Caroline County and paying a host fee. Mohn said everyone seems to be in agreement.\n\"The question is, what is that host fee going to be?\" Mohn said.\nPorter said the county will have a public hearing on this in the future. He did not give a date. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Trump, has been found \"guilty\" on 34 counts of what amounts to a misdemeanor under the usual circumstances. But since Trump is running for president of the United States, the circumstances are not usual, and so the law has been compromised in order to try to halt his campaign.\nA precedent has been set for political enemies to dig up frivolous charges against each other in order to take the other out of the running. This could result in chaos and the complete collapse of our system of government. Are politicians going to begin assassinating each other, as they do in other countries?\nI am reminded of Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons\" about Sir Thomas More who refused to violate his conscience to please King Henry VIII. In a debate with his son-in-law, Thomas Roper, More claims that he would give even the devil the benefit of the law. Roper is appalled and wishes he could tear down every law which stood in the way of destroying the devil.\nMore responds thus: \"Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you — where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?\"\nTwo hundred and fifty years later, one of our founders, John Adams, defended in a court of law several British soldiers who had shot his countrymen in what is known as the Boston Massacre. Adams was an expert on British common law and to him the defendants, whether he liked them or not, had the right to a fair trial; he made sure they had one.\nWhat is British common law? It began with the seventh century laws of the Angles and the Saxons who began to have hearings in which evidence was presented. In the late ninth century, Alfred the Great codified the laws of the Angles and the Saxons, insisting that rich and poor, high and low, were equally treated. In 1215, the Magna Carta stated the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, which is one of the foundations of our judiciary.\nWe have taken our legal system for granted. When some people who commit crimes go free while others are hounded for much lesser offenses, then the laws become meaningless. The people who hate Trump are willing to destroy our legal system in order to ruin him.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Then I left.Clearly this woman remembers me. I don't really remember her. I was kind to her, though. Should I have stopped to chat moreft I was with a group of people, and we were leaving a restaurant.- Was I RudeftDEAR WAS I RUdeft: It sounds like you were appropriately polite to this woman.You greeted her and later answered her question.The moment didn't call for more than that. You were not rude.Yes, you could have lingered a bit longer if it felt right to do so, but acknowledging each other warmly, quickly updating her on your current work situation and keeping it moving was perfectly fine.If she wants to talk more, she may try to reach out.You told her where you work now, so if she really wants to reach you, she probably can, either there or on social media.

Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging — not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
