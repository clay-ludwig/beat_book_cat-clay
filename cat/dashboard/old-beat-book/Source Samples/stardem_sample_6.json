Data was pulled specific to the Chesapeake Fire & Ice Festival in February, as well as year-to-year trends from 2019 to 2024.\nAccording to data provided to the council, North Washington Street saw around 9,200 visits for the two Fire & Ice Festival days this year.\nThat mark is down from around 11,300 in 2024, though this year's foot traffic was hampered by rain during the festival's second day. DeKarske said this year's foot traffic was \"good\" until the weather hiccup.\nShe added that moving forward, her office plans to keep streets open for Fire & Ice to avoid insurance and police costs that are \"really hard to recoup.\"\n\"We're going to see if we can find a way to mitigate the foot traffic and spread things out in such a way so we wouldn't have to close the streets,\" DeKarske said.\nAs for year-to-year numbers, Placer.ai data shows North Washington Street saw around 1 million visitors in 2024. That's down 4.3% compared to 2023, but up 5.6% compared to 2021.\n\"I think that tool is wonderful,\" council President Frank Gunsallus told DeKarske. \" … It was nice to see the positive growth over the last five years, so thank you for your efforts.\"\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery wasn't satisfied with numbers on only foot traffic only.\n\"Foot traffic is interesting, but for economic development purposes, I think we really should be asking what the revenue generation is for our businesses,\" Montgomery said.\nDeKarske said Easton Economic Development Corporation does that by speaking to businesses after events. Montgomery asked that the town aggregate sales numbers from businesses.\n\"That's really the only way we can judge whether this is benefitting our businesses or not,\" Montgomery said. \"If you could find a way to do that, or I'd be happy to entertain a request to have a contractor that (businesses) would trust to collect data and aggregate it for us.\"\n\"Our job is to get foot traffic into town, and hopefully get the right kind of foot traffic that spends money,\" DeKarske responded. \"It is not my job to get them in your store. That is the job of the business owners.\"\nMontgomery said he'd like to bring the topic up during budget season. \"I thought we were getting benefits for our businesses from EEDC,\" he said.\n\"Yes, bringing people to town to spend money,\" said DeKarske.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked DeKarske what businesses have shared regarding why retail and dining spending is slightly down. DeKarske said the cost of living and the recent presidential election year are two factors.\n\"People are just being cautious still,\" she said.\n\"We still have foot traffic coming into town, but people are dining out less,\" DeKarske added. \"And we also need people who live here to support those businesses as well. And so that has been a little bit of an issue, too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "71-year-old spends season in Glacier National Park\n\n November 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County resident Cheryl Krebeck spent a good chunk of her 72nd year in Montana's Glacier National Park. From April to October, she lived on the west side of the park in the northern Rockies.This curious woman loves to travel and is not letting a little arthritis get in the way.\n\"Traveling has been my passion, but when I turned 70, I decided I wanted this decade to be my most exciting,\" she said.\n\"I want to do more than just visit for a week or two,\" she said. \"I really wanted to get to know this park. I went online, applied and got a job. I was hired to work in a hotel that was built in 1910 by the Great Northern railroad. I was a front desk person from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.\"\nWhen she was not making coffee and being a concierge for guests, she had regular challenges — like figuring what to do when a guest accidentally set off bear spray inside the hotel.\nWhen she was not working, she got out into the park.\n\"Your best friends are the ones who have the same days off as you. You don't want to hike alone — there are a lot of grizzlies out there. That is what you are concerned with. Mountain lions could get you. I never saw one, but I had the feeling they were there,\" she said.\nThe more remote part of the park is the east side. When the snow subsides in mid June, the Sun Road opens and connects the two sides of the park.\n\"You see sharper peaks, more glaciers and more snow on top of the mountains. Most of my animal sightings were on the east side. Partly because there are less people,\" she said.\nShe hiked the Highline Trail up at Logan Pass. It reaches 6,600 feet.\n\"It was high for me. I saw a black bear on that hike. It was nice it was not a grizzly,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of the journey was that she was much older than most of her fellow workers. A lot of college students take a summer to do this.\n\"When I look back to being 19 years old, I don't think I had an appreciation for what 70 might have felt like. Some of the first hikes I went on were with young people. They were kind. It really added to it,\" she said.\nKrebeck thinks her traveling has given her a big sky kind of attitude. She loves being outside and inhaling. She is thinking a trip to the Amazon is next.\n\"It is a big world out there, and I feel like I have a perspective because I have traveled. Sometimes you meet closed-minded people and can tell they haven't been anywhere. They haven't talked to anybody from anywhere else. There is a big old world out there, and it is worth checking out,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Godfrey, Calvert Marine Museum Research Associate Paul R. Murdoch Jr. and St. Mary's College of Maryland's Victor J. Perez.\nUntil now, no great white shark tooth has ever been found embedded in a fossil seal bone, but the journal article reports on the discovery of the tip of a fossilized great white shark tooth embedded in a fossilized seal heel bone.\nThe unique two-for-one fossil was surface collected by Murdoch Jr. in Mosaic's South Fort Meade Mine in Florida. The seal bone originated from within the Bone Valley Member of the Peace River Formation of the Pliocene Epoch and is about 4.5 million years old.\nThe partial tooth is identified as having come from an Early Pliocene great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). The discovery also represents the first great white shark tooth ever found embedded in any fossil bone, which may have come about as a result of active predation or scavenging.\nThe presence of the tooth in the seal's hind flipper suggests active pursuit and therefore active predation as opposed to scavenging.\nWhatever the nature of the encounter, the seal did not survive given there is no evidence of healing on the fossilized seal bone.\nTo see the report, go to https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/periodiques/comptes-rendus-palevol.

    "content": "Suicides are at record levels in the U.S.; Men, specifically white men, are driving the wave\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record number of Americans killed themselves last year, according to new suicide numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Who is driving the contemporary surge in suicides?\"Middle-age white males,\" said Dr.Caroline Fenkel, chief clinical officer and co-founder of Charlie Health Inc., a Bozeman, Montana-based mental and behavioral health provider specializing in virtual and outpatient care for kids, teens and young adults.Men made up 79.4% of the record 49,449 suicides committed nationally last year, according to the CDC. White men make up 30% of the U.S. population.They accounted for 60% (29,847) of the suicides last year, according to the CDC.Fenkel said men, especially white men, can feel the pressures of societal and throwback gender role expectations - and still not show stigmatized weaknesses of their mental health.Gender roles associated with career expectations in a market-based economy also play a role, Fenkel said, pointing to how society can look down at working class and lower-income men employed in some lower-paying service sector jobs.\"They are constantly told that they should be successful. That they should be making a lot of money. That they should be providing for or having a family,\" Fenkel said.Men tend to use guns to kill themselves compared to women who use other means such as attempting overdoses.\"Women are attempting suicides more often but don't succeed, while men tend to complete suicides at much higher frequency,\" said Dusti Linnell, an associate professor of practice with Oregon State University's College of Health. She helps lead the university's community mental and behavioral health efforts.\"The completions are associated with firearms,\" Linnell said.Guns were used in 54.6% of all U.S. suicides last year, according to the CDC data, outpacing other methods such as poisoning and overdoses (11.6%) and suffocations and self hangings (25.8%).Fenkel said men are more impulsive in their decisions to kill themselves - and are less likely than women to talk about their mental health challenges openly.\"They are really more likely to self-treat and to self medicate with alcohol,\" she said. \"I think they are less likely to ask for help in general.I think asking for help as a male is seen as a weakness.\" UPSETTING UPSWINGSuicides have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2000. There were 29,350 suicides reported by U.S. health agencies in 2000. They have increased 68.4% since then and 4.1% since 2019 before all the stressors and shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.The 2022 increases include noticeable jumps from 2021 among those ages 45-64 (6.6%) and 65 and older (8.1%) as well as Asians (5.7%) and Hispanics (4.3%).Those all outpace the overall 2.6% jump in suicides from 2021 to 2022.Linnell said she's seen worrisome increases in suicides and suicide attempts by farmers and others working in rural and outdoor vocations as well as continued mental health stigmas and a pronounced counselor shortages making it difficult for those in need to find help.Farmers, farm workers and others working outside have to deal with extreme weather changes including warmer temperatures as well as pesticides and other chemicals.Linnell said lingering stigmas about talking about mental health and suicidal thoughts can be magnified along with social isolations in smaller towns and rural regions.\"One of the most difficult things to say to another person is that you are thinking of killing yourself or harming yourself,\" she said.Fenkel said the shortage of mental and behavioral health workers is so pronounced that as many 150 million Americans live in \"mental health deserts\" where access to services and treatment can be scarce.SOLUTIONS?So what can be done?The growth of telehealth services born out of and magnified after the pandemic has improved access to mental and behavioral resources and sparked the growth of groups such as Montana-based Charlie Health, which was established in 2020.That can allow more therapists and counselors to live and work in smaller towns and rural areas while also seeing patients in bigger cities.It also can offer some privacy for those with mental and behavioral health challenges they might not trust sharing with family or employers. \"It can be embarrassing,\" Linnell said.She said Oregon State is part of efforts in the Pacific Northwest to implement and grow peer-based mental and behavioral health programs.Whether its middle-age or older men or teenagers, it can be easier to talk about sensitive topics such as suicide and self-harm with a friend than family members or employers.High schools and colleges are implementing peer-based mental health programs.Linnell said Oregon State is looking to grow peer-based \"Mental Health First Aid\" and QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) programs.The former entails a six-hour training programs to help participants to build skills to help friends and others in need while the other has shorter 90-minute programs aimed suicide prevention.A key goal is for those considering or recovering from self-harm to believe they can get better.\"It's so important for people to know that recovery is possible,\" she said. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/LENART LIPOVŠEK LENART /UNSPLASH.COM\n \nMen made up more than 79% of total suicides in the U.S. last year, according to provisional data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control. White men, who make up 30% of the total population accounted for 60% of the 49,449 suicides nationally, the agency said.\n \nAP PHOTO/MARK LENNIHAN, FILE\n \nA sculpture called the \"Vessel\" at the Hudson Yards development in New York City saw a series of suicides after opening in 2019. The U.S. saw a record numbers of suicides last year, according to provisional data from the U.S Centers for Disease Control.\n \nThose dealing with suicidal thoughts and mental health crises can call or text 988 for help and resources. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As part of this recognition, nearly 50 students from Kent Island High School had the incredible opportunity to attend the Ravens game against the Washington Commanders and be celebrated for their contributions.\"The Interact Club, led by [teacher Lacey] Phelps has been doing remarkable work to support leadership development,\" Principal Dan Harding said, \"under the guidance of Katie McGrath and in partnership with the Giving the Edge Foundation, run by Bobby Woolley and Colleen Williams. This partnership and the outstanding leadership opportunities it has provided for our students were recently recognized in a big way.\"\nWilliams shared their organization, Giving The Edge Foundation, was the winning recipient of the \"Honor Rows\" Program with the Baltimore Ravens, a program salutes youth groups that provide outstanding service to their communities. Honorees are selected by a panel of youth service leaders with the assistance of the Baltimore Ravens, the Governor's Office on Service and Volunteerism and M&T Bank staff. This year, The Edge nominated the Interact Club and Leadership Cohort at Kent Island High School.\nThe Leadership Cohort started in the spring of 2021 at Kent Island High School by the Giving The Edge Foundation, led by McGrath. The Foundation seeks grants to help support the program and is fully-funded by the Foundation, explained Williams.\nLeadership Cohort allows student leaders to understand their \"WHY.\" Over the years the program has grown from a handful of students to over 40+ students who voluntarily meet before school to talk about who they are, what drives their passion, and they even take a personality test. Last year an Interact portion in partnership with the Rotary of Kent Island was launched to encompass a service above self-component. This school year the Interact Club has over 70 students ready to serve and give back to their community.\nAt the game, the students were welcomed at the Honor Row tent where everyone received a t-shirt and ticket to the game, including VIP access where they were escorted down on the field for pictures and a chance to meet players during warm-ups. While on the field Giving The Edge Foundation was awarded a Governor's Citation for the State of Maryland.

This season, there were plenty of traditional paintings and art pieces but also intricate jewelry, festive holiday crafts and woodworking.Styles ranged from folk, traditional, abstract and whimsical. Patrons could browse or purchase a one-of-a-kind piece over the holidays.\nThe top sellers this year, RiverArts Board member Carol Droge said, were items like Moravian stars, created by Kris Kelley, the Arts Education Coordinator.\nOne of Kelley's favorite pieces to make, the stars are made with Tiffany-style stained glass. Each one, Kelley said, takes about an hour to create.\nAnd they made beautiful Christmas decorations.\nThe stars were placed beside the homemade wreaths, another seasonal best seller.\nLike the stars, the design for them is straightforward but elegant. The crafter, Amos Rudderow said they sell as well as anything he's ever done.\nFinding everything he needs in his yard, it takes him about 20 minutes to make. The side pieces are hard wood; the uprights are birch branches. The rest is decorative placing using skill Rudderow has honed over the years.\nThey were a success with the public, selling 22.\nRudderow's wreath-making is closely related to his membership with the All Seasons Garden Club in Chestertown. Since he's retired he's been working with the club on projects, offering scholarships to the science students at the high school since 2013. The club is always looking for new members, meeting on the second Monday of each month during the periods Sept.-Dec. and Feb.-June at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church.\nFor those who enjoy blending their art with their fashion, Ronn Akins' custom jewelry was on display.\nAkins works with semi precious metals, silver and gold filled. The whole process requires finding the items, organizing them on a bead board, fusing glass, cutting and then placing the items in a kiln. His work yielded alluring results, selling 17 of them. A piece of his jewelry takes at least three hours to create. \"It's a lot of dedication involved,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it.\"\nFor traditional art lovers there was plenty to see and purchase as well. There were impressive flower paintings from Amanda King. She enjoys making floral pieces between her job as a nail technician at \"P Nails.\" Her style is mixed media, using traditional paints as well as pressed flowers.\nHer piece, \"Olivia,\" was inspired by the daughter of the owner of the \"China House.\" With all of her art, she thinks about a person she likes when she creates. Relatively new to the Chestertown art scene, she was welcomed by RiverArts with open arms in May. Two pieces she submitted for December, one a painting of poinsettias, and another of pressed black sunflowers were both sold.\nKing thanked the people who encouraged her to move forward with her art, recalling how nervous she was when she first submitted her works to RiverArts. \"They automatically called me an artist,\" King said. \"They were all so welcoming and friendly to me.\"\nShe offered encouragement to anyone who wants to pursue art. \"I think everybody, if they have a positive attitude, can do this. Don't let shut doors be an obstacle.\"\nPatrons at the gallery could go from King's tapestry of organization and colors to the surreal beauty of an abstract painting by Sheila Exum. Born in Chestertown, Exum's been involved in art since she was a child and has been painting for eight years now. Although many of her pieces are sold, including the latest one in Chestertown entitled, \"Misty Copeland,\" a famous ballerina, she also sees art as a chance to give back to the community. King recently donated art to a ballet company in Wilmington and some sports pieces at a silent auction.\nOf all the arts, she enjoys painting the most, and hopes to make it a career one day.\nShe's taking strides because on Feb. 9, her artwork will be displayed courtesy of the Good Aesthetic Gallery presenting the \"TIDAL WAVE\" group exhibition at the Rehoboth Art League.\nKing said her pieces are getting bigger and she is currently working on another painting of a ballerina, acknowledging she appreciates the grace in the postures.\nThe talent all these artists demonstrated this year was commended by those running the gallery.\nDroge said, \"Everyone has been extremely helpful and it's been a wonderful turnout.\"\nRight now, the gallery walls are bare while they prepare for the next show on March 1, a new idea featuring clay works.\nExecutive Director, Chris Sade announced the show will be called \"Grounded.\" The instructor for the Studio, Manager Kris Neiman, will head it up and will feature the works of local clay artists.\nParticipants will hear from these potters and a little about the process as well, adding a workshop element.\n\"The community will be amazed at what they can do,\" Sade said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Incendiary fires are those that are intentionally ignited in circumstances where the person or people know it should not be.\nIt took 15 firefighters about 20 minutes to control the blaze, according to a press release from the fire marshal. The fire resulted in about $50,000 in damage.\nNo injuries were reported.\nAnyone with information about the fire is asked to contact the Upper Eastern Regional Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal at 410-822-7609.\nThis report will be updated as information becomes available. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New training center will provide cross-training, easier commute for first responders\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — First responders are excited about the benefits a new Emergency Services Training Campus will bring to Talbot County.Construction of a 7,200-square-foot campus at 9095 Mistletoe Drive in Easton is nearing, according to Easton Volunteer Fire Department Chief Sonny Jones. Once completed, the training campus will be run by the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nThe department will coordinate training with the University of Maryland Fire and Rescue Institue, which provides training statewide for firefighters and EMS technicians, including advanced cardiac life support, medical training and emergency vehicle operation training.\nJones and Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, are looking forward to cross-training with public safety partners, including town and county police.\n\"They're great to work with, but it would be awesome to train with them before the emergency happens,\" Jones said. \"I've always said, the first time I meet one of my public safety partners, I don't want it to be at the scene of an emergency. I want to interact with them beforehand so we have a smooth, unified response to an emergency.\"\n\"This will ultimately improve the way we are able to respond to our day-to-day emergencies and our large-scale emergencies because we'll be able to train with our partners,\" LeCates said.\nA drive to Centreville, the location of the closest training facility of this type, is difficult for Talbot County firefighters who may live an hour or more away to schedule, Jones said. With a shorter commute, he expects them to take more training.\n\"Having this facility here, the University of Maryland and their adjunct instructors can host classes right at this facility,\" Jones said. \"So that someone in Tilghman, instead of having to drive 60 miles, may only have to drive 20 or 25 miles.\"\nAt an Aug. 5 Easton Town Council meeting, Jones said the construction contract has been awarded to Willow Construction. The goal is to break ground this September or October on the classroom portion of the building. The fire chief hopes to see the entire project completed before the end of 2025.\n\"We have, what we feel is an attainable goal that probably … fall to winter of next year … you may see the majority if not all of this campus done,\" Jones said.\nWard 2 Easton Town Council Member and fire department volunteer Don Abbatiello emphasized that the project is \"not being built with town money,\" but instead through fundraising. He commended the \"hard work\" from those involved in fundraising efforts.\nThe Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, a nonprofit fundraising arm of the department, has around $2 million left to raise. President Brett Whitehead said all donations through the end of September are being matched by the A. James and Alice B. Clark Foundation.\nA key feature of the facility will be a burn building, which Jones said will be made out of \"steel with special materials inside that are heat- and flame-resistant\" and allow for repeated burning that will help firefighters train in real-life scenarios.\nJones said he used to train in \"acquired structures\" that were a \"one-time deal\" for firefighter training, such as farm houses that were meant to be burned down. The burn building is designed for repeated training.\nLeCates also said the larger training center will help his department experience \"more real-world scenarios.\" \"Now we can bring in wrecked cars … and put simulated patients in them or some of our rescue mannequins in there,\" he said.\nLeCates added that prospective employees may take notice of the facility, a trend that the fire department hopes to see as well. While Jones said his priority is to \"make it easier\" on current volunteer firefighters, he acknowledges the high costs and packed work schedules that make it difficult for younger, prospective volunteers to commit to training at facilities in Centreville or Princess Anne.\n\"Now it's harder to get the younger generation,\" Jones said of the department's recruiting efforts. \"We don't have as many that want to volunteer, and the ones we do are awesome, they're absolutely awesome. They come in, they take all the required training, and they're participating just as well as anybody else.\"\n\" … We just don't have as much of an infill of younger people as we used to have.\"\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated which entity is responsible for managing the training campus. The Easton Volunteer Fire Department will be responsible for the management and operation of the facility. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A statewide project launched last fall aims to reconnect these lost identities with the lineal descendants or communities that the remains are culturally affiliated with.Gov. Wes Moore (D) last fall announced the project, Engaging with Descendant African American Communities, highlighting the collaborative efforts of the Maryland Commission of African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust.\n\"The core of this project is love,\" Chanel C. Johnson, executive director of the Commission and the Banneker-Douglass Museum, said. \"It's painting a human picture of individuals that are lost and I'm really honored to be able to be a part of such a big project, a meaningful project.\"\nThe Maryland Historical Trust said the project at the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory, which is located within Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum in St. Leonard, will use genealogical records, land record research and possibly DNA testing to determine how the remains can be appropriately returned to the ground. Work is being down in accordance with the Maryland's Regulations for the Transfer of Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects.\n\"There's definitely going to be challenges and new discoveries and maybe some pain uncovered,\" Johnson said. \"The end point is going to be really fantastic and have a real, generational impact.\"\nJohnson said this project should take approximately three years and the museum is focused on heavily documenting the process and the results.\n\"Having a report documenting all of the research work is going to is paramount,\" Johnson said, \"as well as doing some type of exhibition, maybe some illustrations or facial reconstruction, to really bring to life who these individuals were, what community life was like in the time that they were alive and to really build on the Maryland story.\"\nThe trust said most of the remains were recovered in the 1960s through the 1990s. Properties associated with these remains include sites near Deep Creek in Anne Arundel County, the Gott Cemetery in Calvert County, Chapel Point in Charles County, Bennetts Point in Queen Anne's County and Twin Oaks in Wicomico County.\n\"These individuals were precious. Their lives were precious. Their stories, as all of our stories do, deserve to be told,\" Johnson said. \"We have that opportunity in 2024 with new technology, with a community and with institutions that are dedicated to make sure that these sacred stories are shared.\"\nElinor Thompson, co-chair of the Ancestral Remains Committee for the commission, said this will be an ongoing project, and the learning opportunities it may provide will last forever.\n\"As we go along, we're going to learn about the histories of the communities that connect to the Underground Railroad,\" Thompson said. \"It's not going to stop.\"\nThe Maryland Historical Trust said the project aims to \"actively engage with descendant communities in an ethical and inclusive manner\" that results in \"a plan for the respectful reburial of the remains that recognizes their cultural importance and historical legacy.\"\n\"To really understand American life and how it was shaped you have to have a knowledge and understanding of Black history,\" Johnson said. \"Anytime that we have an opportunity to really amplify, uncover, document and share histories that have been lost … that's a sacred thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After that, the K-9 units were invited to the Kent County Middle School to receive something special.\nIn a gesture of police support, the Kent Puppy Pals 4-H Dog Club donated a Line of fire Defense Street Fighter vest to Addy, a German Shepherd, handled by Dfc. Craig Lewis of the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office.\nGoing through Kent County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Scott Lockerman's organization, the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, the Puppy Pals donated a check for $300 in June.\nClub Leader of Puppy Pals Kim Montooth explained each year they do a service project. Last year, for instance, they raised money for the Humane Society. This year was exciting for the kids and something different, Montooth said.\nMolly's Place also donated $1,000 in a vest for Waylon, a K-9 black lab handled by Pfc. Nick Lang of the Easton Police Department.\nIn front of about 20 people, the dogs modeled the vests, which are lightweight enough yet specially designed to protect their vital organs.\nThen the Puppy Pals kids and their families gathered around to pet the dogs.\nAfter the children met with the dogs and 4-H mom Karri Bryant had a playful tug of war with Addy, they were invited into the school where they witnessed a live demonstration of how Addy sniffs out controlled substances.\nControlled substances were stashed in two classrooms. Led by Lewis, sniffing desks and drawers, Addy alerted to the controlled substance in both rooms in about 30 seconds.\nTrainer Mark Carr of Tidewater Strategic Services said the dog doesn't go right to the spot because of the nature of scent itself. The K-9 moves around the perimeter of the room, getting the entire scent. Once she gets a complete picture, she can hone in.\nPresident of the club Trenton Montooth was impressed. At 14 years of age, he has decided he wants to be a K-9 officer.\nLockerman thanked the Puppy Pals and Molly's Place, expressing the importance of their giving by showing the positive impact K-9 dogs make.\n\"K-9's make the community safer with their presence. Crime rates go down. Schools are much safer. Even the town's property values go up,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Powerful forces: 'Ahsoka' must save the universe in new Star Wars spinoff series\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 452\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A fan-favorite former Jedi Knight finally gets her live-action, starring moment in the new Disney+ limited series, \"Star Wars: Ahsoka,\" debuting Wednesday, Aug. 23, on the streamer. Starring Rosario Dawson (\"Dopesick\") in the title role, the eight-episode series follows Ahsoka Tano as she takes on the not-so-small task of protecting the galaxy from imminent threats.Former Jedi Padawan-turned-Rebel Alliance member Ahsoka is one of the most beloved characters in the Star Wars universe among fans of the franchise's animated films and TV series. Before Dawson's live-action portrayal of Ahsoka in the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\" and \"The Book of Boba Fett,\" the character first appeared in the 2008 animated feature and subsequent TV series \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" as a teenage apprentice of Anakin Skywalker.The new series is set just after the events of the animated series \"Rebels\" and in the same timeline as \"The Mandalorian.\" Hayden Christensen (\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,\" 2002) reprises his role as Anakin yet again in \"Ahsoka,\" after appearing in 2019's \"Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,\" and bringing the character back to life in the spinoff series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" - presumably as a Force ghost, as he is long dead in this timeline.So, who will the baddies in \"Ahsoka\" be without Darth Vader to represent the dark sideft Returning to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn is \"The Witcher\" star Lars Mikkelsen, who lent his voice to the chilling Imperial officer in \"Rebels.\" Icy in demeanor and appearance - Thrawn is Chiss and his skin glows blue - he is only the tip of the villain iceberg in \"Ahsoka.\" Portraying even more adversaries challenging the Jedi and the universe at large are Ivanna Sakhno (\"High Fidelity\") as Shin Hati, Diana Lee Inosanto (\"The Last Tour,\" 2016) as Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth and the late Ray Stevenson (\"Das Boot\") as Baylan Skoll.\"Ahsoka\" also stars Natasha Liu Bordizzo (\"Day Shift,\" 2022) as Sabine Wren, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\"Kate,\" 2021) as Hera Syndulla, Eman Esfandi (\"The Inspection,\" 2022) as Ezra Bridger and David Tennant (\"Doctor Who\") as the voice of droid Huyang, reprising his role from the Clone Wars series.Portraying a character that is as cherished as Ahsoka, and held in such high regard by one of film and TV's most active and vocal fan bases, is a daunting task. Dawson was up for the challenge, however, crediting stunt co-ordinator Ming Qiu (\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\") with getting her into shape when it came to wielding a lightsaber like a Jedi, as she shared on the Dagobah Dispatch podcast in May: \"When Qiu said, 'This one did not make my eyes hurt,' that was the first compliment that I got, and I think I cried.\" \n \n Caption: Mary Elizabeth Winstead in \"Star Wars: Ahsoka\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-03-17",

    "content": "No consensus on dealing with projected deficit\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last November, progressives in Maryland were thrilled when Democratic candidate Wes Moore was elected governor in a landslide after defeating nine much more well-known opponents in a Democratic primary. They were even more thrilled when progressive Democratic candidates were elected to replace moderate Democratic members and Republican members in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate.Those elections further solidified the Democratic veto- proof supermajorities in both houses of the General Assembly.\nGoing into the 2014 General Assembly session, progressives seemed to be large and in charge. They looked forward to further advancing their progressive public policy agenda.\nAs the 90-day session begins to wind down, that has not been the case, especially on tax and budget matters. It is increasingly clear the Democratic supermajorities are not monolithic, nor is the governor fully embracing an aggressive progressive tax and budget agenda.\nThis outcome was not expected when Gov. Moore presented his proposed state budget in mid-January. Then there was consensus that a balanced state budget would be easily approved before or by the end of the session as required by the Maryland Constitution.\nRecently that consensus has been shaken to the core based on five consecutive revised State Board of Revenue Estimates projecting state budget deficits will be the largest since the \"Great Recession\" which began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.\nNext fiscal year, the deficit is projected to reach $1 billion. In fiscal year 2027, the last year of Gov. Moore's first term, it is projected to grow to $1.3 billion. A year later, it is projected to more than double to $3 billion and could be $4 billion the following fiscal year. These projections do not include the impact of funding to address a $3.1 billion deficit in the state Transportation Trust Fund and $8 billion to fully implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (The Kirwan Report).\nAs a result, there has been intense and even contentious debate in the Democratic supermajorities on what to do and when to do it. The answer depends on who you ask and where they sit.\nThe Democratic House majority leader, Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Democratic chair of the House Appropriations Committee, are united in saying the General Assembly needs to raise taxes and needs to raise them now. The Democratic Senate president and Democratic chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee are saying not so fast, we do not need to raise taxes in this session.\nGov. Moore agrees with the Senate leader's position, there is no need for tax increases for now. Asked if that position would hold beyond the current year, Moore has said, \"I just know that the bar for raising taxes not just this year, but for every single year for me, it's going to be a very high bar.\"\nHis budget secretary has elaborated on Moore's overall strategy on budgets and taxes going forward by saying, \"These revenue trends continue to underscore the necessity of taking bold steps to improve our economy, create jobs and bring new businesses and population to Maryland.\"\nNo doubt the Moore administration is aware of the results when Maryland Democratic General Assembly supermajorities approved a wide range of tax and fee increases proposed by progressive Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley. With a \"Change Maryland\" message that resonated with Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated voters, Republican Larry Hogan won two terms as governor and now has an opportunity to be elected to the U.S. Senate.\nAs is almost always the case In Maryland, final decisions over increasing state spending and increasing state taxes and fees will come down to how much and when?\nThe larger question is how Democratic Party control of the state government will be impacted if the current divide between the shrinking moderate wing of the party and the growing progressive wing of the party on budget and tax matters is not resolved.\nOne unforeseen obstacle to resolving this divide are comments made recently by one high profile progressive Democratic county executive and agreed to by another.\nAnne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said the failure of long-standing progressive \"tax reform\" goals to gain support in the General Assembly is because \"loopholes are everywhere for interests that lobby for loopholes. It's baked into the system. Legislators survive on a diet of campaign contributions to get into office and to stay there. The largest donors tend to be the very interests lobbying for loopholes and opposing a fair distribution of the tax burden.\"\nMontgomery County Executive Marc Elrich agreed with that observation.\nSuch remarks are not going to help advance progressive positions in the General Assembly even when their party has supermajorities.\nGiven all of the above, one can ask if the dynamics in the state legislature may be open to real change. What if Republican members who are accustomed to being largely irrelevant on budget and tax matters in Annapolis, forge a working relationship with moderate Democratic members on issues of common interest such as spending and taxes?\nLikely? No. Probable? No. Possible? Maybe.\nIn politics anything is possible. Ask Larry Hogan and Wes Moore. I suspect both were told early on when they launched their gubernatorial campaigns that winning was not possible.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No injuries were reported.\nFederalsburg Volunteer Fire Company Chief Steve Cox said the fire was in the center of the building. Crews of firefighters worked from both ends to stop the blaze.\nThe State Fire Marshal's office said the fire took about an hour-and-a-half to control. It listed the cause as an electrical failure in the pump room. Cox said the damage was significant.\n\"None of that's saveable, they've got to destroy all that,\" Cox said. \"They'll probably tear the chicken house down. So there's really not a save for anybody. We stopped it from going any further, but they can't save anything.\"\nHe added that other fire companies were a \"big help\" in containing the fire, including crews from Denton, Preston and Greenwood, Delaware.\n\"If I didn't have them, we'd have a worse situation,\" Cox said.\nWhile the loss of chickens was extreme, State Fire Marshal Deputy Chief Caryn McMahon said the departments were able to prevent the fire from spreading and destroying the barns.\n\"The fire department controlled it pretty well,\" McMahon said. \"Typically the poultry barns, once they ignite, it spreads pretty quickly because of the dust and materials inside of the barn.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lions get close but can't dethrone Decatur\n\n May 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 923\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n SALISBURY — Sure, Rich Ferro wanted to win.But with the postseason approaching, Stephen Decatur High's head baseball coach also wanted to use the Bayside Conference championship as a primer for his pitchers.\n\"The worst thing that we can do is bring in a guy that hasn't been in a situation that's a little bit tight,\" Ferro said. \"I don't care if it's 50-0, you pitch in this environment here, you get a little nerved up. We need to do this so everybody feels that little pit in their stomach; so everybody understands this is real baseball. This is different from the regular season.\"\nQueen Anne's County certainly tried to put a pit in the collective stomachs of the Seahawks Tuesday night at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium, when it trimmed an early four-run deficit to one in the top of the fifth inning. But Decatur answered with a two-out, four-run bottom of the fifth before relievers Ben Powers and Caleb Loring pitched back-to-back 1-2-3 innings to seal an 8-3 victory that gave the Seahawks their third conference championship in four years and second straight.\n\"It always seems when we play these guys, it's always one inning,\" Queen Anne's head coach Rick Sutch said. \"And it's usually late in the game.\n\"You got to give them credit,\" Sutch continued. \"They got a lot of two-out hits. It was 4-3 until, we weren't making the quality pitch when it was 0-2, 1-2. So it came back to bite us. But you got to tip your hat to them. They swung the bats when they needed to. And our guys, they hung in there when they needed to. It's always been one inning when it comes down to it.\"\nDecatur (17-2) took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first. Queen Anne's starter Noah Palmer walked Brandon Nadeau and Landon Daniel before Johnny Hobgood hit a two-out single through the middle, scoring courtesy runner Owen Phillips.\nThe Seahawks expanded their lead in the second. Mason Edelman and Spencer Gaylor worked back-to-back walks before Kolten Zender beat out a bunt single to load the bases. Jackson Cheung bounced into a fielder's choice, plating Edelman. Gaylor scored when Nadeau grounded deep in the hole at short. One batter later, Nate Berzonski grounded out to short, scoring Cheung for a 4-0 lead.\nQueen Anne's (10-7), which won seven of its final eight regular-season games to earn its first North Bayside title since 1980, didn't get a hit off Seahawks starter Berzonski, who struck out four and walked one over two scoreless innings. Raj Brachewski, the first of five Decatur relievers, set down the side in order in the third.\nThe Lions got on the board in the fourth. With one out, Jacob Clough lined a shot off the calf of Decatur's third pitcher, Justin Ujelick, who remained in the game. Palmer followed with a double to left that scored Clough, making it 4-1. Ujelick was relieved by Kyle Springle after walking Dulin Clark. Noah Cramer reached on a low throw to first, but Clark was tagged out in a rundown on the play.\nChase Hegedus then hit a 2-2 offering to right field. Courtesy runner Cole Coppage scored, shaving Decatur's lead to 4-2, but Cramer was thrown out at the plate.\n\"Chance had a good two-out hit and we got thrown out at the plate,\" Sutch said. \"But we have to make that play there.\"\nNathan Procopio, who relieved Palmer with one out in the third, walked Cheung and yielded a single to Nadeau to open the fourth. But the right-hander retired the next three to keep the Lions within reach.\nQueen Anne's crept within 4-3 in the fifth. Ethan Keppler walked. Springler retired Caleb Hutch and Procopio. Travis Sutch then launched a triple over Hobgood's head in center field, scoring Keppler. But the Lions couldn't get the tying run home, as Springler got a called strike three on Clough to end the inning.\nProcopio got a pair of groundouts to third to start the bottom of the fifth. But Gaylor stung a double down the left-field line and scored on Zender's single to right. Cheung got plunked on the helmet by a pitch. Nadeau followed with a single to center that scored Zender for a 6-3 edge. Berzonski stroked a single to center, plating Cheung, and Landon Daniel singled to right, scoring courtesy runner Phillips for an 8-3 lead.\n\"It speaks about what they do and how they care about each other,\" Ferro said of Decatur's fifth-inning rally. \"The success is really based on them wanting each other to be successful.\"\nPowers and Loring took care of the Lions in the sixth and seventh, but like Ferro, Rick Sutch said the game should benefit his team heading into the playoffs.\n\"We play on Thursday, so we kind of attacked to where we'd have certain guys set up for Saturday and next Tuesday if we get that far,\" coach Sutch said of his pitching. \"So we were kind of doing the same (as Decatur) but we also wanted to give it our best shot at this game without folding the towel early. I think both teams are well prepared to go into the playoffs now after this game.\"\nNotes: Queen Anne's last appearance in the conference championship was 1980, when it earned a 3-1 victory over Stephen Decatur. ... Clough pitched a scoreless sixth inning for the Lions, striking out two and getting a pop out. ... The Lions are the No. 3 seed in the Class 2A East Region II bracket and will host sixth-seeded Wicomico on Thursday at 4 p.m. in a quarterfinal. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Defending North Bayside champion Queen Anne’s County among teams trying to fill graduation holes in an attempt for another deep playoff\n\n September 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n North Bayside boys soccer coaches have been busy this preseason — and during the early weeks of the regular season — mending holes in their lineups.Defending division champion Queen Anne's County High, which went 13-3-1 and reached the Class 2A state semifinals a year ago, graduated eight, including six starters.\n\"The guys that we lost were huge parts,\" Lions head coach Wade Hosler said.\nNorth Caroline head coach John Austin can sympathize after graduating seven, including 2023 North Bayside Player of the Year Logan Harned.\n\"I feel as a conference we lost a lot of really good players,\" Austin said. \"Last year's conference was very, very senior heavy.\"\nA handful of those graduates are now playing in the collegiate ranks, with North Caroline's Harned at Neumann (Pa.) University and goalie Gavin O'Brien at Frostburg State, while Queen Anne's has Billy Schindler at Washington College.\nThe Class 1A ranks also felt graduation's sting. North Dorchester lost 10, while Cambridge-South Dorchester first-year head coach Josh Dohoney is trying to patch holes created by almost half of dozen losses.\nIn addition to the Vikings, Easton welcomes former standout Avery Brice as its new head coach, while Kent County begins the Dennis Hickman era.\nQueen Anne's shared the conference title with James M. Bennett in 2021, but the last North team to win the Bayside championship outright was Kent Island in 2016, when the Bucs topped Stephen Decatur in penalty kicks. The Bucs and Lions look to be on another collision course to decide the North when they meet in Stevensville on Oct. 18, though North Caroline and Easton figure to also be atop the division ranks.\nThe South's dominance of the conference crown could be extended this year, as Bennett, which lost to eventual Class 3A state champion South River in last year's postseason, returns the bulk of its team from a season ago.\nHere's a look at this year's North Bayside teams.\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Josh Dohoney.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Nate Huber (Sr.); Backs: Osvaldo Hernandez (Jr.); Evan Kozak (Sr.); Colton Phillips (So.); Gibby Robinson (So.); Midfield: Lucas Harper (So.); Gavin Weber (So.); Ryan Harris (Sr.); Forwards: Will Banks (Jr.); Wyatt Abbott (So.); Marcos Hernandez (Fr.).\nOutlook: After one year as an assistant, Dohoney begins his first head coaching job in soccer knowing he'll need to be patient.\n\"We're very young. Very much a rebuilding squad,\" said Dohoney, who played at Delmar, Del.\nThe Vikings graduated more than half a dozen from last year, including center midfielder Randall Johnson. The midfield looks technically sound, but with five sophomores and one freshman starting, Dohoney hopes this will be a season of growth.\nCOL. RICHARDSON\nHead Coach: Dillon Shaheen.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Cohen Carels (Sr.); Backs: Cameron Todd (Sr.); Jacklin Novembre (Jr.); Jackson Jean Jr. (Jr.); Caleb Rouser (So.); Midfield: John Beaven (So.); Jack Walls (Jr.); Preston Rickwood (Sr.); Ludver Vasquez (Jr.); Aydan Downie (Sr.); Forwards: Morgan Demir (Sr.); Angel Castro-Rios (Sr.); Skyler Endzel (Fr.); Brody Omohundro (Fr.).\nOutlook: Shaheen begins his third year as head coach with his most experienced team he's had. That has translated into victories over Pocomoke and North Dorchester for starters.\n\"It's been pretty good so far,\" said Shaheen, who lost three seniors from last year. \"Obviously we have a lot of seniors and juniors, and most have been playing at the varsity level for three or four years. I'm pretty confident in our squad this year.\"\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Avery Brice.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Sam Hutchison (Jr.); Backs: Mario Medina (Sr.); Felix Valentine (Jr.); Brody Byrnes (Sr.); Kai Ferraris (Jr.); Landon Chaney (Sr.); Midfield: Clay Nagle (Sr.); Luke Stanco (Jr.); CJ Chaconas (Sr.); Blake Royer (So.); Ale Monroy (So.); Dominic Stanco (Sr.); Otto Perez-Arreaga (Fr.); Logan Sundt (Jr.); Liam Edgell (Sr.); Forwards: Kyle Ensminger (Jr.); Rodi Fresco Rubio (Jr.).\nOutlook: Brice was a center midfielder on Easton's last two teams to win Bayside titles (2013, '14) and helped the Warriors reach the 2A state final in '14 before continuing his playing career at Wesley (Del.) College.\nNow, he steps into his first head coaching job.\n\"Things are shaping up nicely,\" Brice said. \"Could things be better? Yes. That's kind of one thing that we just hope to do every day in the season; just be better than the day before.\"\nWhile the Warriors have been receptive to their new coach's ideas and style, Brice stressed they must strive for consistency.\n\"The mindset is you can be really good, but every game you've got to bring it,\" Brice said.\nKENT COUNTY\nHead Coach: Dennis Hickman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Leyder Cruz (Sr.); Backs: Noah Iacona (Jr.); Jayden Miller (So.); Stewart Hickman (Jr.); Bryce Jacobs (So.); Midfield: Nick Stead (Sr.); Colbyn Lopez (Jr.); Ethan Clark (Sr.); Forwards: Gabe Parr (So.); Dylan Peralta (Fr.); Sebastian Cousineau (So.).\nOutlook: A 1993 graduate of Kent County, Hickman, who played soccer, baseball and wrestled for the Trojans, takes over as head coach after spending the last two years as an assistant.\nIn an attempt to build a program, Hickman has already achieved one goal in fielding a junior varsity for the first time since 2019.\n\"We think by having a jayvee, getting them out there on practice, getting them those reps and having some game-time situations and play, that we're only going to be able to build on that moving forward,\" Hickman said. \"It's just the best thing for the program.\"\nThat coupled with a varsity roster that includes nine juniors and nine sophomores, could bode well for the future.\nAs for this year's team, there isn't a lot of experience, though Stewart Hickman has plenty of travel ball experience, as has recruited players over the summer to come out for the team.\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Lin Outten.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Quinn Burns (Fr.); Backs: Davis Miller (Sr.); Noah Scopp (Sr.); Gavin Neboshynsky (Sr.); Mark Rees (Sr.); Spencer Chappell (Jr.); Elijah James (So.); Midfield: Simon Vujinovic (Sr.); Brendan Thomas (Jr.); Cooper Liebel (So.); Landon Pecor (Jr.); Forwards: AJ Miller (Jr.); Eric Hoffman (Sr.); Ethan Schriver (Sr.); Robert Simkins (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Bucs have a lot of experience moving from the midfield into the attack, but are not as experienced in the back. Though seniors Davis Miller, Scopp and Rees return, Outten hopes shifting Neboshynsky and Chappell from midfield to the back bolsters his defense.\nAJ Miller netted 10 goals a year ago, and Outten thinks that number will go up, especially with the return of Hoffman, who missed the bulk of last year with an early season injury.\n\"But really what makes the engine go is the three guys in the middle — Thomas, Vujinovic and Liebel,\" Outten said.\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: John Austin.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Mason Shilling (Jr.); Backs: Lewis Higgs (Jr.); Brayden Boarts (Sr.); Jimmy Cohoon (Jr.); Midfield: Ayden Russell (Jr.); Tyler Gutierrez (Jr.); Omar Marroquin (Sr.); Jonnathan Luna Feliciano (Jr.); Diego Castro (So.); Landyn Harned (So.); Kyle Reed (Jr.); Forwards: Heath Frantum (Jr.); Issac Bautista (Jr.); Luke Raga (So.).\nOutlook: The Bulldogs graduated seven from a year ago, including Harned, O'Brien, and also lost leading scorer Kevin Godinez.\nAustin thinks his team will be more defensive-minded this season. The defense is led by Shilling, who Austin thinks has college potential. Shilling and company figure to be tested early, as the Bulldogs open with defending conference champion James M. Bennett, Class 2A state semifinalist Queen Anne's, and perennial conference heavyweight Stephen Decatur.\n\"We have a lot of holes to fill,\" Austin said. \"I think we are where we need to be right now. But the goal is can we just keep getting better as the year goes on, and then when October rolls around, play our best soccer?\"\nNORTH DORCHESTER\nHead Coach: Gabe Guzman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Jayden Coleman (Jr.); Backs: Chris Sanchez (Jr.); Tahjere Pritchett (Jr.); Alex Fonseca-Gonzalez (So.); Martin Chirino Fernandez (Jr.); Midfield: Christian Chase (Jr.); Peyton Bleyer (So.); Daniel Mejia (Sr.); Kegan Henry (Jr.); Forwards: Volcy Nerat (Fr.); Dagoberto Chirino Fernandez.\nOutlook: The Eagles graduated 10, including seven starters. Among Guzman's top priorities is getting his freshman to buy into his system and get acclimated to the high school varsity format.\n\"We're working on trust,\" Guzman said.\nQUEEN ANNE'S\nHead Coach: Wade Hosler.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Ethan Keppler (Sr.); Backs: Christian Coppage (Sr.); Conner Cheezum (Sr.); Hayden Albright (Sr.); Brody Nordvik (Jr.); Midfield: James Rath (Jr.); Gage Jordan (Sr.); Nathan Kostka (Jr.); Mason Albright (Sr.); Boden Blodgett (So.); Josiah Hegarty (So.); Forwards: Ryan Lee (Sr.).\nOutlook: \"The preseason seemed awfully short this year, and our chemistry wasn't quite where I'd like it this time of year,\" Hosler said. \"But I think it's coming, so I'm optimistic that we can do good things. We've had good moments and we've had mistakes. But I like the direction we're heading in.\"\nHosler has also liked his team's 3-0-1 start, which included Monday's 3-0 shutout of North Caroline.\nDespite its big graduation losses, the Lions do have a solid core of returners. Outside backs Coppage and Cheezum return along with Keppler in goal. Jordan is back in the midfield while Lee returns at striker.\n\"We have some big pieces, but we still have some big holes to fill,\" said Hosler, who graduation losses included Schindler, center back William Nagle and leading scorer Nick Esper. \"If we can have some guys step up I think we'll be OK.\"\nST. MICHAELS\nHead Coach: Pat Hambleton.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Will Sherwood (Sr.); Backs: Tyler Murphy (Jr.); Jack Brennan (Sr.); Sherwin Mendez (Sr.); Brennan Dean (Jr.); Midfield: Ethan Royer (Jr.); Gavin Bieber (Fr.); Johnny Mautz (Jr.); Abel Delgaudio (So.); Forwards: Connor Wheeler (Jr.); Miles Fox (Jr.); Haven Haddaway (Sr.).\nOutlook: Having Sherwood — first-team all-North Bayside goalie the past two years — and an experienced returning defensive unit should make the Saints plenty tough.\nWhile that provides Hambleton comfort, he also liked what he has seen on the offensive end.\n\"Finally creative,\" Hambleton said of his attack. \"We're going to be an enjoyment to watch. Still have an older group to support our creative offensive style. I have players to make it a pretty game finally. And they get it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Packard is the 11th master angler since the program began in 2019.In addition to being an extremely avid angler — fishing an average of 240 days per year — Packard serves as a commissioner on the Maryland Sports Fisheries Advisory Commission, representing the tidal and non-tidal recreational anglers in southern Maryland, according to a DNR release.\n\"A cast not taken is a fish not caught,\" Packard said. \"So get out and take that cast, you can't catch a Maryland citation-sized fish if you don't. It all starts with a simple cast.\"\nThe FishMaryland program includes dozens of species from both salt and freshwater. Packard submitted entries for all 10 catches and received individual certificates for each catch. The department will present the Master Angler Milestone Award certificate and a gift card prize to Bass Pro Shops at its store in Hanover. Packard caught his 10th FishMaryland eligible fish, a spotted seatrout, on July 2, off of Point Lookout.\nPackard's qualifying catches, in order, were:\nChain pickerel — 26 inches\nLargemouth bass — 22.25 inches\nChesapeake Channa (northern snakehead) — 30 inches\nRed drum — 45 inches\nCrappie — 15 inches\nSpanish mackerel — 22 inches\nHickory shad — 18 inches\nCarp — 31 inches\nStriped bass — 43 inches\nSpotted seatrout — 24 inches\nPackard fishes frequently in southern Maryland and in other parts of the state in fresh, brackish and salt waters. He fishes mainly by kayak and shore but also fishes on power boats with his extensive network of fishing friends.\nHe is a contributing writer to FishTalk Magazine, providing content about kayak fishing, shoreline fishing and weekly reports on fishing around the Chesapeake Bay region, fresh and saltwater.\nDuring the rare times when Packard is not fishing, he paints as a self-taught artist working in oil paintings, ink or pencil drawings and pastels. Packard worked in IT for the national office of the United Association of Plumbers and Pipe Fitters before retiring.\nPackard has fished since youth and recalls his first time fishing alone in Kansas, where his father was stationed with the Army.\n\"One day my mom said I could fish a nearby pond,\" Packard said. \"I remember finding a topwater bait hanging in a bush. I tied it onto my Zebco 77, took a cast, and a largemouth bass blew up on the bait. I believe I ran straight home to show my mom the fish. That fish was hooked, and so was I.\"\nFishMaryland is Maryland's recreational fishing award program and is a fun way to explore year-round recreational fishing and enjoy affordable, accessible, diverse, and high-quality fishing opportunities. More information on the Master Angler Milestone Award and the FishMaryland program is available on the program's website at dnr.maryland.gov/fisheries. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When West had to win with the king, declarer smiled inwardly to himself.South won West's spade continuation in the dummy, cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in hand and drove out East's heart queen.

    "content": "Nause-Waiwash aim to preserve, uncover history of Native Americans from Dorchester County\n\n August 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Since 1989, the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians have preserved, honored and passed down the stories of their ancestors, many of whom were Nanticoke people living along the Choptank River.Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott is the band's leader. The group preserves the tradition of the indigenous people who fled in the 1700s to the marshes after being converged on by foreign settlers.\nAbbott's passion for exploring the county's native history began when she enrolled in the Nause-Waiwash around 20 years ago, though she wasn't always dead set on joining.\n\"There were probably two, three, maybe four generations that were brought up believing that it was disgraceful to claim your heritage, so they didn't teach it to their children,\" Abbott said. \"And my grandmother was one of those.\"\nAbbott's cousins convinced her to enroll around 10 years before she became the band's second chief in 2014, following the death of former Chief Sewell Winterhawk Fitzhugh.\n\"They brought up a very good point, and that was, 'If you don't (join), how are we going to preserve the history?'\" Abbott recalled her cousins telling her. \"'Because it's fading, it's dying quickly. And what are you going to tell your grandchildren?'\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash is made up of around 300 descendants of not just the Nanticoke, but Choptank and Pocomoke people as well. Nause was a Nanticoke village outside of Vienna and Waiwash a Choptank village outside of Cambridge, Abbott said.\nIt's a \"matrilineal society,\" one where the women hold the power to elect a chief and make important decisions. At meetings, the nonprofit organization plans upcoming events and collaborations with other tribes in the state, along with discussing heritage and history.\nTwo churches — Hughes African Methodist Episcopal Chapel near Cambridge and Wesley Chapel south of Cambridge in Andrews — are being renovated so the Nause-Waiwash can provide services and have a resource center. The organization is hosting its 32nd annual Native American Festival on Sept. 14 in Vienna.\nSuch outreach events are meant to educate people on the history of who occupied Dorchester land, but also how Native Americans treated the land and surrounding waters.\nUNCOVERING HISTORYDespite living on the Western Shore, Erin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash, often combs through records and land deeds in and around Taylor's Island, the community in which she grew up, hoping to piece together her mother's side of the family.\nShe took inspiration from her uncle, who created a family tree for her father's side of the family.\nOnline resources, records from the Maryland State Archives and discussions with fellow indigenous descendants on the Eastern Shore have helped Kennedy and other members of the Nause-Waiwash understand their line of ancestors.\nAbbott emphasized that she's learning every day as well. She's uncertain if permanent state recognition is in the Nause-Waiwash's future given that it's not quite as large as other tribes. However, recent recognitions such as a historical roadside marker next to the Choptank River have raised the prominence of the dedicated nonprofit's work.\nNearly 10 years in, Abbott is developing a love and commitment to the work of the Nause-Waiwash.\n\"I have this passion for it, which I never really knew I had until I became involved,\" Abbott said. \"And I do know that a lot of our history is gone. I want to read all these books and see if I can't find some new information out that I don't know. So I'm reading books that I'd never thought I'd ever read before.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Holiday baking was extra special, as my mother, my sister and I each liked to bake different desserts.Mom loved making pies, cakes, puddings and custards. My sister liked making candies of all kinds \"and especially fudge.\"\nI was the cookie maker. They would not have hit Betty Crocker's list, but my late brother-in-law, Sonny, loved them. He ate them perfectly baked, burned or mushy. He also said they were the best.\nBrother Ollie said even the chickens wouldn't eat them when he threw them into the poultry yard.\nI have improved through the years, and now each holiday I have a grandson, Colin, who joins me in the love of cookie baking. As a matter of fact, we do our first batch on Thanksgiving evening.\nIt is so much fun baking with the children, watching them be so excited to do this \"on their own.\"\nI am going to begin this cookie column today with my mom's favorite cookie.\nGINGERSNAPS1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, 1 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar, 1/3 cup molasses (not black), one egg, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsps baking soda, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about two minutes. I use the paddles on the mixer for this. Add molasses and egg and beat again until well combined. Add in salt, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves and flour and beat until well combined. In a shallow dish add 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Scoop the dough into 1 1/2 tablespoons balls, roll into the sugar in the dish and place on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of room for cookies to spread. Bake for 15 minutes or until cookies have spread and the surface looks cracked. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets before moving to wire racks. Store cookies in an airtight container. This recipe makes 28 cookies. I use Brer Rabbit or the Grandma's brand of molasses. Enjoy.\nCHRISTMAS SWEET AND SALTY TOFFEE35 saltine crackers, 1 cup butter, 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, 1 bag red and green holiday M&Ms, 1 jar holiday sprinkles.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet or jelly-roll pan with tin foil and coat with cooking spray. Line the baking sheet with Saltine crackers. Set aside. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt butter and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously, and let cook until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Pour mixture over crackers in an even layer and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Top immediately with chocolate chips and let melt. Smooth chocolate out into an even layer, then top with red and green M&Ms and holiday sprinkles. Cut into squares, then cool until the chocolate has hardened.\nCHOCOLATE CRINKLE COOKIES1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup butter (melted), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 3 large eggs, powdered sugar for rolling.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk together melted butter, sugars and eggs until well combined. Pour into dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for two hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment. Place powdered sugar in a small bowl. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball. If dough is too sticky, wet your hands slightly to help roll dough. Roll dough into powdered sugar, coating well and then place on a prepared baking sheet two inches apart. After rolling all the dough in powdered sugar, roll each piece again in powdered sugar. This will help get a more dramatic crinkle when the cookies bake. Bake cookies until cookies puff and crack, about 14 minutes. The edges will just be set, but the cracks will still look slightly underdone. Let cool on a baking sheet.\nCANDY CANE SNOWBALLS2 cups butter (softened), 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup chopped pecans, 8 ounces white candy coating (melted), 1/3 to 1/2 cup crushed peppermint candies.\nCream butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Gradually beat in flour. Stir in pecans. Refrigerate, covered, until firm enough to shape, 3-4 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Shape dough into one-inch balls. Place two inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks; cool completely. Dip tops of cookies into candy coating, allowing excess to drip off; dip into crushed candies. Let stand until set.\nOLD FASHIONED CHOCOLATE COOKIES1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/3 cup shortening, 1/3 cup butter (softened), 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 egg (beaten), 1 tsp vanilla, 1 6-ounce package semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional).\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking soda. Set aside, In a large bowl, cream together shortening, butter, sugars, egg and vanilla. Gradually combine half of the flour mixture into the wet mixture. Use a rubber spatula to incorporate the other half of the flour mixture if the dough gets too thick for the mixer. Stir in the chocolate chips. Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, two inches apart. Bake for 7-10 minutes. Remove from the oven when cookies are slightly golden around the edges and soft on the tops. Leave cookies on the pan for 2-3 minutes to continue cooking outside of the oven. Let cool until firm to touch. Serve immediately or store leftovers in an air-tight container.\nITALIAN THUMBPRINT COOKIES2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup salted butter (firm but not cold), 2/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (could be substituted), 2 large eggs (yolks and whites divided), 1 cup unsalted pistachios (finely chopped), 1/2 cup strawberry preserves, 4 ounces white chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate (melted).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and set on medium-high speed, whip together butter, granulated sugar and vanilla bean seeds until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Blend in egg yolks (setting egg whites aside in a small bowl). With the mixer set on low speed, slowly pour in flour and mix until combined (mixture will seem dry at first but will start to come together). Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Whisk egg whites with 2 teaspoons water until frothy. Place chopped pistachios in a small bowl. Remove cookie dough from refrigerator and scoop dough up 1 tablespoon at a time and shape into balls. Drop each ball into egg white mixture and toss to evenly coat, then immediately transfer to bowl with chopped pistachios and roll to evenly coat sides and bottom with pistachios (I just left a circle on top uncoated for indenting). Transfer cookie dough balls to Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheets (fitting 15 per sheet). Using your thumb, make an indentation in the center of each cookie and fill each indentation with a heaping 1/2 tsp of jam. Bake in a preheated oven 14-16 minutes. Allow to rest on a baking dish several minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Cool cookies then fill a piping bag or small Ziploc bag with melted chocolate and cut a small tip off the corner and drizzle with melted chocolate. Store cookies in an airtight container.\nSee you next week for more Christmas recipes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They came with laptops from as far as Frederick and St. Mary's counties to be ready for this year's primary election on May 14.This exacting and meticulous training is what the nonprofit the League of Women Voters is all about. They hold the power to vote as sacred and nonpartisan information about that vote to be integral.\n\"The goal is to provide training for the people that are going to be doing the voters guide and inputting information in the Vote 411 website,\" said the president of the Queen Anne's County League of Women Voters, Elizabeth Hammond.\n\"This is it for in-person training. There will be an online training on Saturday, Jan. 20. I think it is a good idea to do both of them,\" Hammond said.\nShe said the organization gets donations to do this work and create the voters guide both online and in print.\n\"We insert it in the Record Observer and then order about 500 extra copies and distribute them to towns and post offices and various other public places to pick up and get information to make intelligent decisions about what they want to vote for,\" Hammond said.\nShe is clear about the big picture of voting rights.\n\"Voting is one of the freedoms that we absolutely cherish. You want to be able to make a responsible decision and vote for the candidate that you think can do the best job. That is what we try to do with the voter's guide — to give the voters the best information possible in a nonpartisan way,\" Hammond said.\nShe said this primary election will be smaller than the general election, which will have a more involved voter's guide.\nThe state Board of Elections is the ultimate authority for the League of Women Voters.\n\"It amazing what the state Board does. What the election boards do is amazing, and they really deserve all the support we can give them and their thanks. That's why you watch the candidate listings on the state board, because that is what is going to show up, and then the proof comes when they send out the individual ballots for each county. The hard thing is you have to look through each one of those ballots. It is like 200 pages long,\" said Jeanne Halpin of the League of Women Voters of Maryland.\nShe led the training that took place at the Queen Anne's County Public Library in Centreville.\nShe tried to be less daunting to all the volunteers that showed up across the state.\n\"This is just a great learning opportunity. Don't get stressed, don't go crazy. The political parties are nominating candidates. They are asking people to run.

Its expected attendance is around 4,000, according to the permit application. The Easton Police Department recommended approval.\nThe festival is organized by the Delmarva Pride Center and features vendors, businesses and food, with attendees lining South Harrison Street for the celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus and Councilmembers Maureen Curry, Don Abatiello and the Rev. Elmer Davis all voted for the permit's approval. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nIn January, Gunsallus and Montgomery voted against approving the public assembly permit for 2024's event. At the time, Montgomery brought up concerns of \"overtly sexualized performances and behavior\" from dancers at the festival.\nAt the January meeting, festival organizers maintained that the dancers were professionals and not \"scantily clothed.\" The 2024 permit was narrowly approved 3-2, with Curry, Abbatiello and Davis in favor.\nMontgomery told the Star Democrat on Tuesday that if he was present at the most recent council meeting, he would have once again voted against approving the permit.\nEarlier this year, Gunsallus was heavily scrutinized by town residents for questioning whether the town should use funds to hang Pride banners and for stating the Pride flag is \"antithetical to America.\"\nBut on Monday, Gunsallus initiated the motion to approve the festival permit for 2025, which this time was passed with no back-and-forth council discussion.\nTina Jones, co-founder of the Delmarva Pride Center, thanked the council for its unanimous vote during public comment Monday evening.\n\"I know in the past we've had some difficult conversations in this room,\" Jones said. \"I'm glad to see that we have moved beyond those. And we look very much in favor of continuing to work very closely with this town.\n\"Personally for me, it's a great sign for all of our community that this has happened tonight. As Rev. Davis said at the beginning, this is a community that's made better by everybody that's here, and your vote tonight showed that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three teenagers were arrested following the altercations.\nThe pattern that is emerging — basketball games scheduled between the two schools at Easton High this season will be played without fans; basketball games slated for Cambridge-SD will be forfeited by Easton High. The issue came down to playing the game with limited spectators. Easton wanted to limit or play without spectators. Cambridge-SD wanted spectators allowed.\nThis past Sunday, Easton High announced on its Instagram page, \"Due to events that occurred during the EHS vs. CSD football game in the Fall, we have decided not to allow spectators at our upcoming girls and boys basketball game against CSD at Easton High School. As always, safety is a top priority. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your support and understanding.\"\nOn Tuesday, the administrative offices of Cambridge-South Dorchester posted a statement on its Facebook page announcing Easton's decision to forfeit Thursday's boys' game at Cambridge-SD, and the Feb. 15 girls' game slated at Cambridge-SD.\n\"It is with great disappointment that we must convey this news: Easton High School has decided to forfeit the upcoming girls' and boys' basketball games scheduled to be held at Cambridge South Dorchester High School on Jan. 11 and Feb. 15,\" the statement said. \"This decision was made by Easton High School and was not influenced by Cambridge-South Dorchester High in any way.\"\nThe post went on to say, \"As a result of Easton High School's prearranged decision to forfeit these games, Cambridge South Dorchester High School will be credited with the wins for both of the boys' and girls' teams. We regret that parents, spectators and community members will not have the opportunity to witness these anticipated games.\n\"While we extend our best wishes to Easton High School, it is essential to emphasize that safety remains our top priority. We too understand the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for all involved.\nCambridge-SD High School was closed Wednesday due to weather conditions. Phone calls to the office of Cambridge-SD athletic director Casey O'Bier went unanswered.\nOn Wednesday, Talbot County Public Schools released a second statement in an email, saying that following the football game, administrators talked with coaches, athletes and parents about safety at future events.\n\"TCPS made the difficult decision not to allow spectators at upcoming home basketball events against CSD,\" the statement read.\nHome games against Cambridge-SD will be livestreamed.\nThe statement continued that Talbot County school administrators asked that Cambridge-SD limit spectators at their home games.\n\"They chose not to,\" according to the Talbot County schools statement.\n\"Because the safety of our students and staff is always our highest priority, we have decided not to travel to CSD for the boys' and girls' basketball games on Jan. 11 and Feb. 15, thereby forfeiting those games,\" the statement read. \"We value our relationship with our Dorchester County neighbors and believe this decision is in the best interests of all of the athletes involved.\"\nThe Easton and Cambridge-SD rivalry is one of the Bayside Conference's richest, especially in football and boys' basketball.\nEntering Thursday's boys contest, Cambridge-SD (7-0 overall) was sitting atop the North Bayside with a 6-0 record and bidding for its first division title since 2020. Following the Vikings are second-place Queen Anne's (6-1) and Easton (5-1). Thursday's forfeit moves the Vikings to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the division, while Easton slips to 6-4 overall, 5-2 division.\nThe boys' game at Easton is scheduled for Feb. 15 and will not have spectators.\nCambridge-SD's girls enter today's game at 5-2 overall, 4-2 North, trailing division leaders Queen Anne's (7-0, 6-0) and Kent Island (6-1, 6-0). Easton's girls are currently 3-6, 3-3.\nStar Democrat Reporter Natalie Jones contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nineteen rounds were fired and Simms sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the chest.\nOn Thursday, though, a jury acquitted the other main suspect, 18-year-old Jo'Mir Norman, of all charges in relation to the case. Prosecutors relied heavily on video evidence and clothing in trial, but dealt with challenges during witness testimony and the fact that the murder investigation started off with a significant mistake.\nBryan was arrested by police last November, but it came after police misidentified 15-year-old Brian Wongus Jr. as one of the two suspects. Maryland State Police wrongly arrested Wongus and charged him with first-degree murder, among other offenses. Charges were dropped in late October or early November, according to an MSP spokesperson.\nThe misidentification of Wongus as one of the two shooters came up in Norman's trial this week. Attorneys on both sides acknowledged the error, though offered different opinions on how the evidence leading to the misidentification compared to the evidence presented against Norman.\nAs for Bryan, a jury trial previously slated for mid-July was postponed. A future trial date has not yet been released.\nCharging documents allege Bryan fled from the shooting scene just after 7 p.m. on Oct. 20, 2024. Investigators reviewed surveillance video and allege clothing worn by Bryan earlier that day was found in a house on Camelia Street where the suspects allegedly fled to after the shooting.\nAccording to court documents, investigators interviewed a witness who identified Bryan and provided his street name, \"Krunch.\" The witness saw Bryan on Camelia Street before the murder, per court documents.\nBryan is being held without bond at the Dorchester County Department of Corrections. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Steady leadership, respect earn voters' support\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we proceed full speed into the 2024 presidential election, the levels of bitter, vitriolic, divisive, often misleading, bombastic and demeaning rhetoric from candidates of both parties continues to escalate.This election cycle reminds me of a bitter and contentious general election for governor in Pennsylvania.\nIn that election, the Republican candidate was William Scranton, a former one-term Republican member of Congress. The Democratic candidate was Richardson Dilworth, the incumbent mayor of Philadelphia.\nScranton's political resume was thin. His only experience as a candidate was his successful run for Congress. Despite that, the state GOP was bullish on him after losing to Democratic candidates in two previous gubernatorial elections. They believed Scranton's success as a volunteer civic leader on economic development issues in a depressed region of a rust belt state would resonate well with voters.\nDilworth on the other hand, had a long history of political success in Philadelphia. He was elected city treasurer, district attorney and twice as mayor. His success was due in part to Philadelphia being a deep blue city with huge numbers of Democratic votes cast in local and statewide elections.\nDilworth's electoral success in Philadelphia was also based in part on a simple, but effective campaign strategy. His campaign would purchase time on a local TV station to which he would invite his opponents to a debate. He did so fully expecting his opponents would not participate. They always obliged him. As a result, he had a full hour of viewers to himself, where he reminded them not only of his accomplishments, but also repeatedly mentioned that his opponent chose not to participate in the debate.\nAs the November gubernatorial election heated up, Dilworth again rented TV time and invited Scranton to join him for a debate. He smugly assumed that Scranton, like all his previous opponents, would be a no show.\nDilworth assumed wrong.\nMinutes before airtime Scranton unexpectedly strolled into the TV studio. A surprised and angry Dilworth had a meltdown. It started when Dilworth shouted at Scranton, \"What are you doing here?\"\nDuring the debate, Dilworth peppered Scranton with insults. With thinly disguised contempt he called Scranton a phony, a coward, a Little Lord Fauntleroy, and an Ivy League Dick Nixon. Unruffled, Scranton calmly but forcefully responded with \"You, sir, are a desperate man.\"\nAll of this was captured on film and was also widely reported by the print media who were there for the debate. Even those who did not see the actual television debate read all about Dilworth's meltdown.\nThe debate was an unexpected and game changing negative branding movement for Dilworth's grace under pressure, civility and steady leadership credentials.\nBy contrast, the debate was an unexpected and game changing positive branding moment for Scranton's grace under pressure, civility and leadership credentials.\nIn November, Scranton beat Dilworth with 55% of the total statewide votes. This occurred despite strong support for Dilworth from President Kennedy who had carried Pennsylvania in the preceding statewide presidential election.\nThis is a lesson for the candidates the Republican Party and the Democratic Party eventually nominate for president in 2024.\nAmerican voters have long deserved and rarely seen a presidential election where candidates are not demonizing those who disagree with them and their supporters, by questioning their motives and their intellectual capability to make informed decisions.\nRegularly showing grace under pressure, civility, steady leadership and respect for all views during a long and often grueling campaign is the best way for candidates to earn voter's support and gain their trust to govern fairly and inclusively if elected.\nNow is the time for presidential candidates from both parties to commit to disagree on issues without being extremely disagreeable. Voters deserve nothing less.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters.

Bands from the district's schools joined together to welcome staff, and many other students performed and introduced speakers for the gathering.\nJeremy Hillyard, the district's 2024-2025 Teacher of the Year, and Rosario Steele, the district's 2024-2025 Support Staff of the Year, were each presented with a 2025 Chevrolet Trax from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton.\nGeneral Manager Pat Papineau thanked Hillyard, Steele and all of the district's teachers for their dedication to their professions.\n\"I imagine that a lot of people think that your guys' job starts a few minutes before the kids get there and ends a few minutes after the kids leave,\" Papineau said. \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. … It's pretty much nonstop. You're continuously trying to improve yourself, you're continuously investing in yourself, you're continuously investing in your students.\"\nHillyard, a Spanish and English second language math teacher at Easton High, and Steele, an instructional assistant for English second language students, both delivered speeches to the crowd.\n\"Each of us in this room plays an important role in our students' stories,\" Hillyard said. \"And it's our job and up to us to make that role a supporting one by always having their backs.\"\n\"This job has been the most rewarding experience in my life,\" Steele said. \"I have witnessed those students that start as ninth graders with very little English inspire me when I see them in the community after graduation.\"\nMany other awards were handed out during the event. AJ Rojas, the district's facilitator of interpretation and translation, was presented with the Wardell Brine Multicultural Award. Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning, was named winner of the Brewster Merrill Technology Award.\nNamed after a past superintendent, the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award was presented to three staff members: Charlotte Compton and Heather Ewing, teachers at Easton Elementary, and George Larrimore, a bus driver since 2010.\nMOVING FORWARDDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi closed Thursday morning's festivities with a speech indicating major areas for the district to focus on. Some examples were staffing, transportation, dress code and student behavior.\n\"I believe in bite-sized chunks and taking it slow, so that it's not a lot and it doesn't seem overwhelming,\" Pepukayi said.\nShe noted that adding mentors for incoming teachers and math coaches has been successful for the district. Pepukayi said the district will begin working on a new four-year strategic plan, as the current plan wraps up in 2025.\nAt the end of her speech, Pepukayi indicated the district is maintaining its three priorities of improvement heading into the 2024-2025 school year: academic equity in math, an \"engaging\" environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining a more diverse staff.\n\"We're going to stay the course with these three priorities as we continue to move into this next year of transforming and performing together,\" Pepukayi said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was only a few hours after they crossed the Key Bridge on their way home that the bridge collapsed.\nA container ship slammed into the iconic bridge just before 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. Within seconds, the bridge crumpled into the chilly waters of the Patapsco River at the entrance to the Baltimore Harbor.\nIn the hours that followed, authorities began search and rescue efforts for survivors of the collapse. Radar indicated that vehicles had been discovered at the bottom of the river, which is about 50 feet deep.\nBy Tuesday evening, officials said that six construction workers who had been repairing potholes on the bridge at the time of the collapse had been presumed dead. Two construction workers were rescued in the efforts.\nTuesday morning, Santana looked out on the now collapsed bridge from a hill on Dundalk Avenue, across the street from the Logan Village Shopping Center.\n\"It was scary because it could have been us,\" Santana said.\nSantana wasn't the only one looking at what's left of the I-695 bridge. People filtered in and out Tuesday morning to see it for themselves. \"Shock\" was a word repeated often.\n\"Shock and dismay,\" were the words Judy Corkhum used to describe the emotions of residents she had talked to.\n\"Nobody in a million years thought we would wake up this morning to something like that,\" said Corkhum, who also viewed the collapsed bridge from off Dundalk Avenue. \"It brings back emotions from 9/11. ... You saw that and the first thing you think is, 'Oh my god. The people. The workers.'\"\nCorkhum, who recently moved to Baltimore from Dundalk, said she heard about the bridge collapse via a text from a neighbor at 4 a.m. Tuesday. She said her friend's son, a truck driver, \"literally just got over the bridge before it happened.\"\n\"She said, 'I was having a heart attack this morning thinking he was out on the road last night,'\" Corkhum said.\nCorkhum said her friend went into surgery this morning, so she was happy to know her son was OK.\nAnthony Meeks, a Dundalk native, said he heard about the collapse as soon as he woke up.\n\"The Key Bridge is a very iconic piece of Dundalk,\" he said. \"It's something that everybody who's from Dundalk or this city even has at one point in their life crossed.\"\nMeeks remembers being scared to cross the bridge when he was younger. These days, he crosses it every two weeks.\n\"It (will) make me go out of my way to find a different path to get to where I need to go,\" he said about the collapse. \"It could make my trips be a lot longer.\"\nMeeks called the incident an eye opener.\n\"Because it's like you don't really expect these kinds of tragedies and stuff to happen and occur in your neighborhood,\" he said.\nDundalk-Patapsco Neck Historical Society President Jean Walker said this is the first time Dundalk has experienced a large disaster like this.\nHistorical Society Vice President Joe Stadler called the event \"unbelievable.\"\n\"It takes a while to fathom it,\" he said.\nFor both Walker and Stadler, the bridge has been a big part of Dundalk. They said the founder of the Historical Society, Ben Womer, was \"instrumental\" in getting the bridge named after Francis Scott Key, the author of the national anthem.\n\"It's the backdrop for everything around here,\" Stadler said about the bridge.\nStanding on the hill, looking at the wreckage of the bridge, Corkhum said she had to make the trip from her new home in Baltimore to see what had happened with her own eyes.\n\"I'm so used to seeing that pretty view out there every day,\" she said. \"It's going to be horrible seeing that (there's) no view anymore.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stephen Harvey is bringing jazz to St. Michaels\n\n January 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST MICHAELS — When Stephen Philip Harvey is playing the saxophone, the sounds that come from the horn of the golden instrument are lively, rhythmic and attention-grabbing.Harvey, a celebrated and well-decorated musician from the Eastern Shore, has a generational love for music.\nIts a love he shares with those running the Windon Distilling Company in St. Michaels, who have invited the musician to be a part of unveiling their newest endeavor.\nHaving just finished its 11th year of production, the distillery is opening a new event space, Golden Hour, next to its staple tasting room. Harvey will be performing a sold-out show to mark its opening Friday night.\nThe distillery's founder Jaime Windon said in a press release, \"this space is designed for showcasing the things we love the most: rum cocktails alongside brilliant and inspiring music, art and community. To be able to debut it while enjoying jazz along with our friends and neighbors in January is a dream.\"\nHarvey was raised in a family passionate about music and would perform for their local church. Raised on gospel music, he soon expanded his repertoire into jazz and gained an appreciation for gathered sounds and instruments.\nAccording to Harvey, it's not uncommon for someone in his family to break into song.\n\"My love for music is really a family love for music,\" Harvey said. \"My whole family are singers and musicians… (there are times) we would be on a walk to meet up together in a space, and then someone would be like, 'oh, let's sing this hymn,' and then we break out into four part harmony. My wife was very startled by it the first time she was at a family event.\"\nAs Harvey grew up, his curiosity in music began to change away from gospel when his high school band director encouraged him to join the jazz band. From there, his relationship with music took several twists and turns.\nWhen he got to college, his interest peaked in studying music education before choosing to focus on Western European art music, where he learned song styles of Italian, German and French musicians.\nBut it was American music through idioms of bebop, hard bop, vocal jazz and then big band jazz that made Harvey want to commit the rest of his life in exploring those sounds.\n\"It's this really interesting hobby/career where I feel like I can just do it forever and always discover new things, even looking back and going forward,\" Harvey said. \"So discovering new things as I write and discovering new things as I listen to people who have performed and recorded in the idiom before me is so cool, especially since you come from this family that loves music so much.\"\nToday, Harvey is a professional musician, composer and bandleader. He has released seven full albums throughout this career, with \"Library Card\" being his latest release.\nAdditionally, his compositions have been performed by an array of ensembles across the world including the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, ensembles at the Peabody Conservatory of Music and several universities across the nation.\nHarvey sees his upcoming performance as part of an effort to expand jazz music's presence in the area, a mission the distillery's owners are also on board with.\nWindon said she is a fan of jazz and was incredibly excited to host Harvey and his trio Sphinx as the first musical act at Windon's new event venue.\nFor Windon, Harvey has an electric presence.\n\"I have a great appreciation for jazz music of all kinds of styles, and so I liked that his music felt classic and familiar, but yet fresh,\" Windon said. \"… There's a charisma, to me, that Stephen has that I think is also reminiscent of jazz musicians that I've always known and gravitated towards.\"\nHarvey said he has performed in Easton and his concert will be his first time playing in St. Michaels. He shared that he's excited to establish himself on the Eastern Shore and share his love for jazz.\n\"My whole vibe since I've moved down here is seeing what a vacuum of jazz and Black American improvised music is on the Shore,\" Harvey said. \"There's like none, and I would love to produce as many shows as possible, whether they are in conjunction with Lyon Rum and the Golden Hour or anywhere else. I'm just excited for any opportunity to play inside of this county.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The bill focuses on maintaining accessory solar, which is residential solar that is generating power for a property's electrical use.\nAfter discussing several definitions they wanted to revise, the commissioners raised concerns about donating money to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. The commissioners have no problem with donating to agricultural land preservation, they said, but they want to make sure the money is going back to farms in Caroline County.\nThe county contributes $20,000 per year to the land preservation foundation. On top of that, commissioners said, when solar projects come into Caroline County on agricultural land, the solar company has to pay an agricultural transfer fee, which the county also donates to MALPF.\nCommissioners Vice President Larry Porter's concern is if the state funding was cut on MALPF would the county still receive financial help to preserve agricultural land.\n\"If we collect money in Caroline County, I want it to be used to preserve farmland in Caroline County,\" Porter said.\nNo official decision was made on donation of the funds, and the county will continue to discuss options at future meetings, the commissioners said.\nThe county officials will discuss some changes to the proposed bill and move the bill to an official legislative bill with the purpose of having the first reading at the next county commissioners meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said that through investigation, the person was identified as Braun.\nEndzel described the content of the videos Braun pleaded guilty to distributing, which all included underage girls. Endzel said that when police executed a search and seizure warrant at Braun's residence, Braun told police that he knew he messed up.\nAfter Endzel detailed the case, Braun's attorney Holland Brownley, who is with the Talbot County Public Defender's Office, said she had no additions or corrections to Endzel's summary.\nBefore entering into a plea agreement with the state, Braun had received 34 charges. Seventeen of those charges were for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 charges were for possessing child pornography.\nAs a part of the plea agreement, the state will enter nolle prosequi for the remaining 28 charges Braun did not plead guilty to, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nThe six counts Braun pleaded guilty to each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years and a maximum fine of $25,000.\nBraun was not sentenced during the plea hearing, and a sentence hearing date has not yet been set.\nThe state recommends Braun receive a sentence of 25 years with all but six of those years suspended. The state also recommends Braun serve five years of supervised probation and be added to the sex offender registry as a tier II sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "COVID censorship?: Could Mark Zuckerberg's admission on government pandemic pressure impact the 2024 election\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1131\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Could META / Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's mea culpa that the Biden-Harris administration \"repeatedly pressured\" the social media giant to censor dissenting voices during the COVID-19 pandemic translate into a major issue in this year's elections?In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee released Monday, Zuckerberg said the White House pressed Meta Platforms (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) to censor and restrict accounts and posts that went against U.S. government and administration public health policies during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret we were not more outspoken about it,\" said Zuckerberg, promising to push back on future government pushes in the letter dated Aug. 26 and posted on the committee's Facebook page and to its account on X.\nIn a statement, the White House defended its COVID social media actions.\n\"When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety,\" the statement to Politico and other media outlets said. \"Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\"\nREKINDLING COVID FIGHTS?\nThe letter comes as Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump face off in the 2024 election just over a year from when the Biden-Harris administration officially ended its pandemic emergency declarations in May 2023.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 27 million U.S. jobs were lost, millions more saw their hours or pay cut, as many as 40% of small businesses were closed and close to 1.2 million deaths were attributed to the virus by public health agencies.\nThe coronavirus was a once-in-a-lifetime, global event. The pandemic included fights over economic and social restrictions and business and school shutdowns and pushes for government and employer vaccine mandates. Government spending and central bank infusions during both the Trump and Biden-Harris administration fueled 40-year inflation highs with high prices still hitting American households.\nOverall, U.S. prices are up 23% since the pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBut other than persistent, post-pandemic inflation (which voters count as a top concern headed into November), COVID has not been a prime campaign issue.\nThat could change with Zuckerberg's letter, increasing conflicts between policing social media and free speech, and independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump.\nKennedy is a strong critic of pushes by the Biden-Harris administration and other Democrats for vaccine mandates as well as their push for social media restrictions during the pandemic.\nHe also wants more scrutiny of vaccines as well as processed foods.\nIn a social media post before his endorsement of Trump and moves to take his name off ballots in Electoral College battleground states, RFK Jr. vowed to keep COVID in the spotlight.\n\"The government also selected the lockdown winners and losers, transferring nearly $4 trillion of wealth from the middle class & small business to Silicon Valley and big box stores,\" Kennedy wrote.\nZuckerberg's letter was also not lost on Kennedy.\n\"Looks like Mark Zuckerberg has joined the ranks of the crazed conspiracy theorists who claim that the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor dissent during COVID,\" RFK Jr. said Tuesday.\n'MEMORY HOLED'But the issue has not been overtly pressed by Trump, Biden or Harris during the 2024 campaign.\nWhy not?\nThe pandemic stretched across both the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations. Coronavirus vaccines were developed and gained fast-track approvals under Trump. They were widely deployed by the Biden-Harris administration which also pushed for a number of vaccination mandates that faced court challenges.\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate after her installation at the top of the ticket after Biden quit the race in July, was an ardent advocate of COVID restrictions and shutdowns during the pandemic.\nWalz backed mask mandates, instituted a COVID hotline for residents and neighbors to report those not abiding by social distancing, stay-at-home and other pandemic rules and threatened repeat violators with $1,000 fine and 90 days in jail, according to executive orders.\nEric Raile, a political science professor at Montana State University, said in an interview before Zuckerberg's letter that voters are fairly well entrenched and the fights mirror deeper American political divisions.\n\"There's not much left to wring out of the pandemic,\" he said.\nThe two national political camps had some alignments during the pandemic.\nMassive spending measures aimed at rescuing the economy from a recession or depression were approved by both Trump and Biden. That spending, along with central bank infusions in the U.S. and across the world, help drive the post-pandemic wave.\nDr. Anthony Fauci led U.S. COVID responses for both administrations, although he fell out of favor with Trump and was fully embraced by Biden.\nWhile Biden and Harris advocated for vaccine mandates for some workers, Trump left many restrictions and policies to individual states. He has touted developments of the COVID vaccines under his watch and made off-the-cuff and confusing comments about the use of UV light and disinfectants to combat COVID.\nOther political scientists and campaign consultants see many voters wanting to move forward from all the economic, educational, social public health traumas of the pandemic.\nJeffrey Lazarus, political science professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, contends many Americans have \"memory holed\" the pandemic and its myriad of stresses.\n\"I think people want to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n'RETURN TO NORMALCY'Ryan Waite, a veteran consultant who has worked mostly on Republican campaigns, noted the rapid news cycles and significant campaign upheavals — including the attempted assassination of Trump and Biden being pressured to quit the race — and how that makes events such as the coronavirus pandemic seem distant.\nCraig Snyder agrees that most voters want to move on from COVID and its upheavals, pointing to parallels to sentiments after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918.\n\"I think there are very few voters who are thinking about [that]. They've probably been concentrated as RFK Jr. voters,\" said Snyder, a Pennsylvania-based consultant who is serving as director for the anti-Trump Haley Voters for Harris groups.\nSnyder said American elections are often about moving forward — especially from stressful and traumatic events. He sees contemporary similarities to the aftermath of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic (which coincides with World War I), which killed an estimated 675,000 in the U.S and as many as 50 million worldwide, according to the University of Pennsylvania.\nSnyder pointed to Republican presidential candidate Warren G. Harding's successful campaign slogan of \"Return to Normalcy\" as reflective of the broader sentiments in 2024.\n\"For the most part, the majority of voters want to be in the rearview mirror,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland’s housing order aims to boost affordable housing, cut barriers\n\n September 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SANDRA SMITH Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland's escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state.According to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units — a gap that has been widening over recent years.\nThe 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland's housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low and middle income residents.\nConversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market.\nThe executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.\n\"[The executive order] says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,\" DHCD Secretary Jake Day said.\nIn more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards.\nWhile Maryland's median income is 28% higher than the national median, the state's median home price is 35% higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing.\n\"How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,\" Secretary Day said. \"It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.\"\nThe Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure.\nTransit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation.\n\"There are a lot of benefits to it… we want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There's no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,\" Maryland Department of Transportation's Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development, David Zaidain, said.\nAccording to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage.\nZaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development.\nThe executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward.\nThe legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs.\nThe Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions.\nBy centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead.\n\"When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped — either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we're just producing expensive [places] for people to live,\" Secretary Day said. \"By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We had over 70 volunteers from the community to help - including student volunteers from the Boys Scouts, the sea cadets, adult volunteers, and local school volunteers.\" Volunteers - of all ages - wore \"Make a Difference Day\" shirts that said: \"Ask me a?\" on the back. Volunteers spent the day providing information and services throughout the event.While the Division of Housing and Community Services oversees the event, a large committee plans and executes it. Composed of people from local businesses, agencies, and individuals from the community, many of the original Make A Difference Day board members remain on the committee and are active members in both the planning and in volunteering during the day.Sea cadets volunteered their time and politely welcomed each person in attendance by opening the doors and formally greeting them.Sea cadets are 10 to 17 yearolds who participate in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC), a youth leadership development program sponsored by the U.S. Navy.Once through the doors, attendees were given a navigator (who spoke their language) to guide and help them through over 50 tables, services and resources, all conveniently in one location.Each person and family could select the services they needed. Services included: legal aid, social services, meals and food access, education, transportation, housing, personal hygiene, and much more. Eddie the Barber, stylist Ashley Calderone and many Queen Anne's County cosmetology students completed 30 to 40 free haircuts on Saturday.The dental van completed over 30 free dental screenings and provided goodie bags to all.Other services included free flu shots and medical testing (blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose testing).The Lions Club helped more than 10 people with vision needs. Additional services were also offered throughout the day.Giveaways were offered to everyone and were crowd pleasers - toiletries, hats, mittens, blankets, slippers, socks, diapers and wipes, and food from the Maryland Food Bank. Many of those were made possible by donations.The entire event is funded through grants, sponsors and monetary donations from the community. And all donated items found homes that day. \n \n Caption: TAMARA FORTE\n \nKent Island Lions Club members John Kirby, Dave Sipes, and Charlies Sipes aid families in need with eye exams and glasses at the annual Make a Difference Day in Sudlersville on Nov. 4.\n \nTAMARA FORTE\n \nThe Make a Difference Day sign welcomes the community in the doors of Sudlersville Middle School and shares the goal of the event, \"providing county resources and services for families in need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Newnam Armory at 509 S. Cross St., Chestertown.Members of the Frank M. Jarman American Legion Post 36 came to pay homage to those soldiers lost on the beaches of Normandy that bleak day in 1944.\nOf the 2,501 US troops who died, many were from here.\nAt the foot of the stone monument, post members laid a wreath and flowers donated by The Mill of Kingstown, showing the Legion is just as active in the community as when they had their building at 9155 American Legion Road.\nThe monument reads: \"In grateful tribute to the men of the medical detachment of the 115th Infantry Regiment Maryland National Guard, both living and dead this shrine is dedicated. Their valiant efforts helped preserve freedom in America, 1941-1945.\"\nAt that sacred spot, incoming Post Commander Tim Lloyd, a veteran of the Navy, provided remarks.\n\"We lost some good people, and their sacrifice gave us our freedom today.\"\nCommander Paul Showalter talked about the clandestine nature of the mission the Kent County soldiers trained for at the Armory.\n\"Two days prior to June 6, 1944, the activity to get prepared to go to Normandy wasn't mentioned in (President) Roosevelt's fireside chats,\" he said.\nRoosevelt only hinted at it.\nIn the armory, built in 1931, was where those soldiers trained. From that training area, men went to the European theater and engaged in the largest amphibious invasion in military history, a battle that changed the trajectory of World War II. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester Burial Sites Preservation Board gets another chance\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 717\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A board designed to help preserve grave sites in Dorchester County has one year to prove it is able to accomplish its mission or it will face dissolution.After holding a public hearing about repealing a chapter of the county code regarding burial sites preservation, the Dorchester County Council agreed Jan. 21 to keep the chapter — which includes the Burial Sites Preservation Board established within it — for a test period.\n\"A one-year test from today to see what you can accomplish and see if it is a worthy board to have within this county,\" Council Member Ricky Travers said before making the motion.\nThroughout the public hearing and following discussion, council members brought up concerns of past problems with the board's participation and its ability to work cohesively. Council President Lenny Pfeffer said that in the one-year test period, the board would need to prove it can fill its seats and provide a quorum at its meetings.\nTravers said board members would need to work together, not against each other as has been the case in the past.\n\"As passionate as people might be about grave sites, ... we cannot have this controversy,\" Travers said. \"So whomever comes on that board needs to be willing and ready to work side-by-side.\"\nCounty Planning and Zoning Director Susan Webb said the Maryland Historical Trust is the state's enforcing entity regarding burial sites preservation.\n\"And we were basically duplicating the effort,\" she said. \"While this may be a good board for a nonprofit, being under the county's umbrella, I don't think it's working out.\"\nDorothy Samonisky, the chair of the Burial Sites Preservation Board, said the Maryland Historical Trust only gives guidance and does not \"act as an arm of the law\" like the county can.\n\"So right now, this burial site preservation is the only thing that gives you as county members anything to stand on if there is an incident with a grave site.\"\nPfeffer clarified that the board is an advisory group to the council.\nSamonisky said people have been buried in Dorchester County since 1669, and many of those burial sites are on private property. She said the policy in county code gives the county the authority to \"act upon destruction of those cemeteries.\"\nAshley Samonisky, who also spoke during public comment, said the board can guide council actions and help with outreach and education. She said there needs to be something in the code that addresses what happens if a person \"maliciously destroy(s) a property or (tries) to hide the fact that it was there,\" in order to build a beach house, for example.\n\"There needs to be fines,\" she said. \"There needs to be penalties up to and including the cost of restoring it to the pre-demolition stage. These are just a few ideas that this body can help with.\"\nDorothy Samonisky acknowledged that there were \"internal conflicts\" between several board members at one point. She said she also was out due to two major surgeries in 2024.\n\"We had met up through '23 and had things on the agenda and topics to discuss,\" she said.\nCouncil Vice President Mike Detmer, who ultimately voted in favor of the board having a one-year test period, said he thinks the board has value, but would function better if not affiliated with the county.\n\"It being a law and having to be constituted a certain way and done a certain way is holding an effort to preserve burial sites back,\" he said, later adding, \"I think it could be more flexible and more dynamic as a stand-alone.\"\nDetmer said as long as he is on the council, if someone comes to the council with \"a salient point\" about something in the county, it will get attention. That doesn't require a board, he said.\nBefore the council unanimously agreed to give the board a test period, Travers said the board had previously gone through an \"extremely adversary\" time that got to the point where some board members felt unsafe coming to the meetings. He said the county practically had to act as a referee.\n\"And that's not what we need on our boards,\" he said.\nPfeffer warned the this can't happen again.\n\"The last board that was assembled ... had brought things to this chamber,\" he said. \"Had brought thoughts of slander. Had brought disagreements. I will not allow that to happen during these meetings.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The beloved Blue Crab Coffee Shop in St. Michaels has reopened under new ownership, but they're not new to many on the Eastern Shore. Bagery owner Matt Andrews has expanded his reach from Easton to St. Michaels with the Blue Crab.Andrews took ownership of the establishment in May, and he says he's excited to honor the history of the space.\nThe Blue Crab building was a formerly Odd Fellows Lodge, built in 1867. It was originally named the Shealtiel Lodge No. 1024. Four years after the Civil War ended, the building was renamed to the Freedom's Friend Lodge No. 1024, and is the oldest Odd Fellows Lodge remaining in Maryland.\n\"All the plates that we use are from former Odd Fellows Lodges around the country,\" Andrews said.\nHe wants to pay homage to the building's former use by learning and preserving its history through social media videos, interviews with members of the historical society, and by getting footage of some of the artifacts.\n\"We're anxious to learn more and tell people about it,\" he said.\nAlong with the interesting history that comes with the establishment, Andrews is excited to expand service beyond breakfast and lunch. He said they plan on testing out dinner service soon but want to get their footing at the new location first.\nAndrews says the community response has been overwhelmingly positive with strong feedback on the organic bread products made from scratch in Easton.\n\"All the feedback has been good about the food and the coffee and service,\" Andrews said.\nFormer Blue Crab owners Helen and Brian Herman stepped away from the restaurant in mid-April so Helen could focus on her architecture practice, Brian on his recording studio and so the two could spend more time with their three children, according to a Facebook post made by the Blue Crab in early April.\nAndrews said the Herman's still own the building and he has a good working relationship with them. \"We've had a good relationship with them over the years,\" he said. \"They have been buying bagels wholesale from the Bagery since we opened in 2018.\"\nAccording to Andrews, a majority of the menu uses the products they make in house at the Bagery and has an array of vegan options.\nBlue Crab baristas Anna Szwaja and Alyssa Skinner said the transition in ownership has been smooth. Szwaja worked for the Blue Crab's previous owners last summer, and Skinner started at the Bagery a year and a half ago.\n\"We all get along really well,\" Szwaja said. Skinner agreed, saying she really enjoys her co-workers.\n\"I like getting to know customers and people that come in regularly,\" Szwaja said as she gestured to the knitting club in the back of the restaurant. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Landon Hawkins of Centreville achieved an extraordinary feat this January by reaching Junior Champion Row with three different entries.Fifteen-year-old Landon, a ninth-grade student at Faith Christian School in Sudlersville, attended the Northeast Poultry Congress Poultry Show in West Springfield, MA, this past weekend. This prestigious event is the third-largest poultry show in the country, attracting top competitors from across the nation. Martha Stewart was in attendance, adding to the prestige of the event.\nHis outstanding accomplishments included winning Junior Champion Waterfowl with a white call duck drake, Junior Reserve Champion Waterfowl with a gray call duck pullet, and Junior Champion Turkey with a Royal Palm Tom.\nLandon has been passionate about poultry for years. He started hatching chickens and turkeys four years ago, but his ambitions took flight when he decided to focus on building a foundation stock of high-quality bred Call Ducks.\nGetting a bird ready for competition requires months of preparation and conditioning to ensure it meets the American Standard of Perfection — the official guideline for judging in poultry exhibitions and county/state fairs.\nHis first win was at the county fair level where he won Champion Waterfowl at the Queen Anne's County Fair in August with one of his Call Ducks. This victory was just the beginning of his journey in competitive poultry showing.\nInspired by his grandmother, who shows Sebastopol geese, in American Poultry Association (APA) sanctioned shows across the region. Landon turned his focus to competing in sanctioned shows.\nWith careful attention to breeding, grooming, and conditioning, Landon began winning at various American Poultry shows in Virginia and New Jersey, proving that his birds were top-quality contenders.\nWith this success, he set his sights on an even bigger stage—the Northeast Poultry Congress in Massachusetts, one of the most competitive shows in the region.\nFor Landon, showing poultry is about more than just competition. He says his favorite aspects of showing include traveling to new destinations, meeting experienced poultry breeders and mentors, and the thrill of anticipating how the judge will score his birds. Each show is an opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with others who share his passion.\nBeyond the show ring, Landon and his grandmother are taking their dedication a step further. They are in the final stages of launching Hawkins Poultry, a specialized breeding program focusing on Call Ducks, Sebastopol Geese, and Royal Palm Turkeys. Their goal is \"to raise and exhibit top-quality birds while promoting these breeds to other enthusiasts and exhibitors.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Doncic learning it takes awhile to win\n\n June 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 861\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Michael Jordan needed seven seasons to win his first title. LeBron James needed nine seasons and two futile trips to the NBA Finals before he became a champion. Shaquille O'Neal got swept in his first finals. And the newly crowned champion Boston Celtics lost the finals in 2022 and lost in the Eastern Conference finals last year before breaking through now.The lesson, as everyone knows: Winning the biggest prize almost always takes time. Not always. But usually.\nSuch is the reality for Luka Doncic. At 25, he already is one of the best players in the world, if not the very best of the bunch. But he's not a champion. Not yet.\nThe wait for his first championship will extend until at least 2025, which really shouldn't be all that surprising. Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks weren't a logical pick in this series against the Celtics; one was a 50-win team that caught fire at the end of the regular season, the other was a 64-win team that was better than everyone from the very beginning. The smart money said Dallas would fall in these finals, and that's what happened. It ended Monday night in Boston, the Celtics winning 106-88, an 18-point margin for their record-setting 18th title.\n\"They're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, the maturity, and they have some great players,\" Doncic said when it was all over Monday night. \"We can learn from that. We've got to fight next season.\"\nLet's be clear: Losing these NBA Finals should in no way be an indictment of Doncic. He could have played better, of course. Smarter at times, for certain. He spent some of the finals arguing too often with referees. He knows that. That said, letting a finals loss take anything away from the first six years of his body of NBA work would be ridiculous.\nHe's scored 11,470 points so far, 15th most of anyone through their first six NBA seasons. Throw in his 3,472 rebounds and 3,317 assists, and Oscar Robertson is the only other player with such stats from Year 1 through Year 6. James came close. Jordan came close. But they didn't have those numbers.\nIt's not like this needs explaining, but just in case: Doncic — already a five-time All-NBA first-team selection — is on an absolute Hall of Fame trajectory.\n\"He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff,\" Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving said earlier in these finals. \"He's been giving it his all.\"\nDoncic played through knee and ankle issues in the playoffs. He had a thoracic contusion that required painkilling injections to get through the NBA Finals. He wasn't at his best, and he would have had to be otherworldly for Dallas to have had a real chance in this series.\nHe finished the playoffs as the leader in points, rebounds and assists anyway. Not the Mavs' leader, the NBA's leader.\n\"He's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. \"So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing, now it's just being consistent. ... When you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship.\"\nThe Mavs felt that Doncic was the real MVP of the league this season, and their argument was compelling even though it didn't resonate much with voters. Kidd says Doncic's greatness gets taken for granted, which may be true. When Doncic gets it going, it's must-watch TV. He makes scoring look as easy as anyone has in this generation. He's not a high-flyer like Jordan, not someone who plays with the force, flair and power like James does. But when he's on, forget it.\nHe might not be \"the\" face of the league. But he's in the conversation, especially globally. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver watched Doncic closely on the day before the finals started and, in his own words, came away with yet another \"example of how international this league is.\"\n\"Someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain was doing interviews in three different languages,\" Silver said. \"Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA.\"\nThe Mavs bristled at criticism Doncic took during the finals, but in some ways, that's welcome-to-the-club stuff. Jordan heard doubters. James still does. The Celtics, until Monday night, did as well. They don't doubt nobodies. Comes with the territory, and Kidd hopes Doncic converts it into fuel for his future.\n\"When you're on the biggest stage, someone's got to poke a hole,\" Kidd said. \"This will only make the great ones better. When you look at … LeBron, Michael, the greats, the GOATs, they all were poked at, and they came back stronger and better. I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Big surprise'?: Anti-war vote could be a wild card in razor-thin Trump-Harris race\n\n October 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Could anti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab-American Christians) upset with U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas potentially tip the 2024 election away from Vice President Kamala Harris in favor of former President Donald Trump?In 2020, President Joe Biden won 69% of the Muslim vote, compared to Trump's 17%, according to Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Exit polls by the Associated Press in 2020 gave Biden 64% of the Muslim vote versus 35% for Trump.\nTimes have changed.\nThe Biden-Harris administration's military and diplomatic support for Israel's war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and ongoing conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon have eroded Arab-American and Muslim support for Harris' White House bid.\nMore than 43,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war more than a year ago, when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. More than 100 of those Israeli hostages (including a handful with dual American citizenship) are still being held by Hamas and other Islamic militants.\nIsrael's continued siege and bombings inside Gaza have killed more than 20,000 women and children, according to the United Nations, citing Palestinian estimates.\nA worst-case scenario for Harris is that Muslim voters, Arab American Christians and other anti-war voters (including younger voters) back the Green Party's Jill Stein (who opposes the war and U.S. backing of Israel), Trump or sit out the election, which could potentially tilt the razor-thin election in battlegrounds including Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\nSEISMIC SHIFT?A national poll released last month by the Arab American Institute found Arab Americans shifting away from Democrats and Harris.\nThe group said in the past Arab Americans voted for Democrats by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.\nThe October poll found Trump leading Harris among Arab Americans 42% to 41%, with 12% backing a third-party candidate such as Stein or Cornel West, who also opposes the Gaza war.\nHarris is polling 18 percentage points below Biden's 2020 standing with Arab Americans, according to the poll.\n\"In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,\" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement, pointing out 81% of Arab Americans view the Israel-Hamas war as a top issue.\nThere are more than 3.7 million Arab Americans in the U.S., according to AAI.\nClose to 393,000 Arab Americans live in Michigan (which Biden won by just over 154,100 votes in 2020). Another 126,500 live in Pennsylvania (which Biden won by more than 78,500 votes).\nAAI estimates two-thirds or more of Arab Americans are Christians, while one-quarter are Muslim.\nWhile Evangelical Christians are among the staunchest supporters of Israel, Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church and more liberal Protestant denominations — which also have churches in the Holy Land — have pressed for an end to the war and criticized Israel's Gaza bombings and invasion as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.\nAnother poll released earlier this month by the Arab News and polling firm YouGov gives Trump a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among Arab American voters. Stein gets 4%.\n'BITTER PILL'\nLate August polls by the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) showed Harris getting 28% of the Muslim vote in six key Electoral College swing states, compared to 30% for Stein and 15% for Trump.\nThe CAIR poll gave Harris 12% of the Muslim vote in Michigan (a key swing state with a significant Arab-American population) versus 40% for Stein and 18% for Trump.\nRobert McCaw, government affairs director for CAIR, said Harris hurt her standing with Muslim voters with recent pronouncements that she wouldn't change anything about the Biden administration policies.\n\"She stands by the policy of providing Israel with U.S manufactured weapons,\" McCaw said.\n\"It's a bitter pill for Muslim voters to swallow,\" he continued.\nMcCaw said if margins are tight in the presidential race or key Senate contests, anti-war voters could tip the balance. He also said like any group, Muslim voters can look to other issues, including the economy and social matters. He warns candidates not to take them for granted with Gaza in the backdrop.\n\"They could be in for a big surprise,\" he said.\n'VITAL VOTES'\nOne leading anti-war group, Abandon Harris, has endorsed Stein.\nHudhayfah Ahmad, spokesman for the group, said the U.S. administration's \"disregard for Palestinian lives has deeply damaged Harris's credibility with a large bloc of voters, including Muslims, progressives and human rights advocates.\"\n\"Their votes are vital in this election, and with each bomb dropped in Gaza, Harris's candidacy suffers more,\" he said.\nHarris — who has been heckled by anti-war protesters at some campaign rallies and TV appearances — has tried to walk a political balance beam of supporting Israel's right to defend itself after the Hamas attacks and continued rockets from Hezbollah while calling for a ceasefire. She also snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress in August, and did meet with him at the White House voicing concerns about war deaths.\nHarris told CBS News Saturday the U.S. would help defend Israel if Iran strikes back after Israel Defense Forces bombed installations in Iran on Friday.\nAhmad is frustrated with the year-long cycle of top U.S. administration officials, including Harris, calling for and talking up a ceasefire and occasionally criticizing Netanyahu, only to see truce talks falter, coupled with White House and Pentagon pronouncements of \"ironclad support for Israel\" and continued military support.\n\"This cycle of empty calls for a ceasefire, followed by a new round of munitions shipments, has become insulting to Muslim voters and others who care about ending the massacres. It's a hollow strategy that tries to pacify the public, while enabling the very acts they claim to denounce. People are tired of the hypocrisy,\" Ahmad said.\nNO FANS OF TRUMPHarris does enjoy backing from Emgage Action, a Muslim group advocacy group that backed Biden in 2020.\nEmgage CEO Wa'el Alzayat said \"Gaza has been completely destroyed, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, including many children, and a population of two million has been destitute.\"\nBut Alzayat said voting for a third-party candidate will help Trump win the White House.\n\"Muslims do not need to be reminded of who Donald Trump is,\" Alzayat said, pointing to the travel bans he proposed from several Muslim countries, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and backing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.\nAlzayat said Trump also \"blessed Netanyahu's expansionism by recognizing Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights\" and has promised support for Netanyahu on the campaign trail. He sees more hope in Harris, despite her standing by Biden's war stance.\nAhmad is also no fan of Trump.\n\"Trump's record on Palestine is disastrous — he's championed Israeli expansion and disregarded Palestinian rights altogether. Muslim voters have every reason to distrust him on this issue,\" he said.\nA national poll by The Economist and YouGov shows 36% of Americans sympathize with Israel in the war, 17% back the Palestinians, 25% have equal allegiances and 22% aren't sure. More than two-thirds of conservatives and 45% of wealthy voters back Israel, according to the survey.\nThe same poll shows 32% of Americans believe Israel is committing genocide in in Gaza, while 35% say they aren't and 32% aren't sure.\n'PEACE, NOT WAR'Trump has promised strong support for Israel and is backed by pro-Israeli mega-donor Miriam Adelson and other pro-Israel advocates including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Eighty two percent of white Evangelical Christians — who are among the strongest backers of Israel — support Trump.\nBut he has also vowed to end the Holy Land war, as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump had a group of Muslim leaders and imams — including Dearborn Heights, Michigan Mayor Bill Bazzi — on stage with him during a rally in Michigan on Saturday, welcoming their support.\n\"We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,\" said Imam Belal Alzuhairi. \"We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.\"\nTrump has also promised global protections for Christians, promising support for Coptic Christians in the Middle East and pointing to the sectarian dispute between Orthodox Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis.\nThe U.S. provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually. The Biden-Harris administration backed a $14 billion war aid package and approved a $20 billion long-term weapons sale to Israel earlier this year, and has sent troops, weapons, fighter jets and naval assets during the war with Hamas and Hezbollah and skirmishes with Iran.\nThose efforts enjoy bipartisan support. Still, Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, as well as Trump, argue Biden and Harris have not been supportive enough of Israel.\nTrump is also courting Jewish voters, another traditional Democratic voting bloc, and has touted his communications with Netanyahu. Jewish voters backed Biden over Trump by a 68% to 30% margin in 2020, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.\nA poll this month by academic research group CHIP50 found some slippage, with Harris holding a 54% to 36% lead over Trump among Jewish voters. A new poll by Channel 12 TV in Israel shows 66% of Israelis back Trump in the U.S. election versus 17% for Harris. More than 90% of Netanyahu backers prefer Trump over Harris, according to the Israeli poll.\nThis comes as Harris and Democrats press the case that Trump is a fascist who admires Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\"I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,\" Trump told a campaign rally Monday in Atlanta. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

And we also deployed our speed sign to remind the vehicles of their speed in hopes of calming any potential speed issues.\"\nKellner said that in running radar and collecting data from the speed sign, the police department really sees an issue with speeding.\nHe said that large and loud vehicles driving down a small, narrow street can sometimes give off the perception that the driver is speeding.\n\"Our findings were that most of those larger vehicles were following the rules of the road,\" he said.\nIn the spring, the second part of the project is set to begin.\n\"We're estimating April,\" Lewis said. \"I mean a lot of this is dependent on weather temperatures, asphalt, plants, a lot of factors.\"\nLewis said the second part will include adding plants to the new structures, adding signage, elevating land on the far east end and making improvements to the parking lot.\n\"The whole concept is to build a higher area all along the Strand to protect it from the stormwaters off the river,\" Lewis said.\nThe parking lot will be built with storm management areas underneath it so that storm water can enter it and be filtered before going back out. The parking lot will be paved with asphalt, with a cobble layer underneath it.\n\"There's a lot of - not just tidal water coming from the river - but also stormwater settling along that road in the parking lot,\" Lewis said.\n\"So bringing all of that elevation up to prevent that and allowing the water to go under the road and then back out into the creek will basically build resilience for that whole area.\"\nLewis said that as the sea level rises and the intensity of storms increase, infrastructure along the Strand becomes more vulnerable.\n\"Keep in mind, this is the only road we really have that runs along the water,\" she said. \"This area here, it's worthy of this type of resilience protection because a breach in any place, especially up near the parking lot, would be so difficult to repair.\"\nLewis called it a project for the future.\n\"With the impacts of sea level rise and stormwater and tidal water management that we're seeing currently,\" she said, \"it's necessary to look at how to build in these areas with natural infrastructure that will help to protect it in the future.\"\nDavid Ghysels, who walks along the Strand every day, said he thinks the project will be nice when it is complete, particularly if it helps with flooding.\nLewis said she has received positive and negative comments from residents on the project.\n\"I think the closer you are to the project physically, the more involved you may have been over the last five years,\" she said. \"So I think that one of the impacts will be people who don't go there regularly or aren't involved in the government regularly all of a sudden want to know what happened. So it's really just a continued educational process.\"\nMac Sommerlatte, who lives next to the beach, said he thinks the project should, when finished, positively impact the town by minimizing shoreline erosion and mitigating the impact of sea level rise. He said the project is a complicated one.\n\"I think one of the problems is that there are several projects here,\" he said.\n\"It's not just one. And people don't seem to have the complete information on all of them. And they may disagree with parts of it.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n A sign at the Strand Beach in Oxford on Dec. 12 saying that the Shoreline Improvement project will be completed after a few months of an adjustment period, which will allow the new infrastructure to settle. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is called experience.Take, for example, today's deal, which I spotted in a magazine. According to the author, many declarers at a tournament missed the best play. Unfortunately, so did the author!In the modern tournament game, North could rebid a forcing two spades. However, if your two-over-one response may be made with only 10 or 11 points, you must jump to three spades on the second round to force to game.If the defenders begin with one heart and two club tricks (in any order), followed by a third club from East, South has a nasty guess. Why, though, should West lead a club (or the heart king)?Many Wests led a trump, which ran to South's seven.Apparently, the unsuccessful declarers immediately played off four rounds of diamonds, discarding three hearts and ruffing the last in the dummy. They cashed the spade ace and led a heart off the dummy. However, East won with the ace, gave his partner a diamond overruff and collected two club tricks to defeat the contract.The writer recommends ruffing the diamond six at trick two. Then he cashes dummy's last top trump and leads a heart. However, if East has the nerve to play low, West can win with the king and switch to clubs.The third round of clubs promotes West's spade jack as the fourth defensive trick.Attacking clubs immediately works, but an expert would almost subconsciously lead the heart queen from hand at trick two, opening communications. Given the initial spade lead, now no defense can cause problems. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

By approving this, they have cleared the way for the Trappe Town Council to vote on this phase of the Lakeside development.The commissioners approved Phase 1D of the subdivision revision, with the notation that the areas identified as public open space on the plat would be clearly labeled as such.\nTrappe Attorney Lyndsey Ryan stated that open space is defined as active and passive open space for public use and enjoyment.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., the engineering, architecture, and environmental firm constructing the Lakeside development, told the commission that there may be some confusion about the distinction between public open space and private space.\nRauch wanted to ensure that the areas labeled as public open spaces were properly understood to be used by the public.\nThe open space would not be within stormwater management. Rauch explained that the areas in the exhibit will be green open areas for \"throwing frisbees.\" The exhibit has two parks: Lakeside Public Park and Wooden Public Park. There is public access to the sidewalks between the two areas by trails.\nOpen space areas would be under the homeowner's association's mandate and management, regardless of whether they are designated as public or private. Rauch clarified that for any areas designated as public open space, the HOA would have the obligation to provide a permanent and perpetual public easement for access and use.\nThe development agreement states that the public shall have a permanent and perpetual easement to use and enjoy the open space, which may not be limited by the petitioner or any HOA.\nThe commission voted to approve the revisions of the subdivision to make sure that all designed public spaces were clearly labeled.\nCannabis\nOrdinance 1-2024, an ordinance for the town of Trappe to establish reasonable zoning regulations for cannabis businesses, was also approved by the Planning Commission and will be recommended to the Town Council for approval.\nMargaret English, a resident of Trappe, was a vocal advocate against approving the zoning regulations for cannabis businesses.\n\"I don't think you should recommend it,\" English said. \"I don't want drugs in my town, and I ain't moving.\"\nCommissioner Edgar Harrison noted regardless of whether or not he agreed with her; he didn't think the state would permit the town to outlaw the introduction of cannabis businesses into town. After the meeting, he sat down with English and listened to her concerns regarding cannabis. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Two acclaimed Festival alumni — cellist David Agia and pianist Leili Asanbekova — will return to perform at Emmanuel Episcopal Church, 101 N. Cross St. Tickets will be available at the door for $20, with proceeds supporting the free lunches the church provides to Festival musicians.\nEmmanuel Church's role\nEmmanuel Episcopal Church plays a pivotal role in the annual Festival, offering spaces for rehearsals and performances and providing weekday lunches to musicians, mentors and staff.\nFestival Executive Director Caitlin Patton praised the support, saying: \"It's the generosity of the Chestertown community — particularly our host families and Emmanuel Church — that makes our Festival possible and our community special. This fundraising concert will recognize, at least in a small way, all the essential volunteer effort and generous support that Emmanuel Church provides.\"\nFeatured musicians\nCellist David Agia has performed as a chamber musician, recitalist and orchestral player at venues including Carnegie Hall, Alte Oper Frankfurt, Palacio de Festivales, Symphony Space in New York and Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal. He has appeared in numerous festivals and master classes. Agia is an adjunct professor of cello at Rowan University.\nPianist Leili Asanbekova began studying music at age 6. She has performed at concerts, government events and festivals, and won several local and international competitions. She has collaborated with conductors including Marek Moś, Vladimir Spivakov and Yuri Simonov. She is pursuing her Doctor of Music degree at the University of Maryland.\nConcert program\nThe concert will feature three works for cello and piano by Italian and Spanish composers.\nAlfredo Casella and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco were members of Italy's \"Generazione dell'80,\" tasked with creating a \"new Italian sound.\" Both had complicated relationships with the fascist Italian government. Castelnuovo-Tedesco, who was Jewish, emigrated to the United States in 1939, finishing his career in Hollywood.\nEarly 20th-century Spanish composer and cellist Gaspar Cassadò's music reflects his Catalan roots. A student of Pablo Casals, he dedicated his cello and piano piece Requiebros to his teacher.\nAbout the Festival\nThe National Music Festival brings together world-class mentors and young professional apprentices for two weeks each June. The 14th season will run May 31–June 13, 2026.\nApprentices receive full scholarships and housing, mostly with local host families. They rehearse and perform alongside mentors in orchestral, chamber and solo recitals, presenting more than 30 concerts and dozens of open rehearsals.\nMore information on the Festival, tickets and donations is available at https://nationalmusic.us \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Appreciating oysters\n\n January 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1416\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Having grown up on the Eastern Shore, the oyster has been a much-appreciated seafood in my life.My mother made some of the greatest tasting oyster fritters on the Mason Dixon line. There are no watermen in my family, but we lived close enough to the water to respect the life of the waterman and the delicious delicacies that were a result of their hard work.\nIn our local area here, the most popular oyster varieties include Malpeques, Well Fleet, Blue Points, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Chincoteagues, Apalachicola Bay and Gulf Coast.\nEast Coast oysters range from slightly salty to sharp salt flavor (Chesapeake, Delaware and Gulf Coast oysters have a light salt taste; all others have a sharper salty taste).\nThe Chesapeake Bay has been home to oystering since the early 19th century. Chesapeake Bay skipjacks are the last commercial sailing vessels in the United States.\nThe dredge boats once numbered in the thousands. Today only about a dozen or so remain.\nSkip jacks are limited to 150 bushels of oysters daily. The dredging season runs from November through March 1. The recent ice has made it impossible for the boats to get out to perform their work — cutting into the ice and cutting into the pockets of our waterman and their families. Check your local newspapers and the Facebook posts of local fire departments, churches and organizations with upcoming oyster dinners and roast coming up for their fundraising events.\nI know that many seafood markets are featuring fresh oysters in the shell or by the pint and quarts or opened for you. I like to open my own — eating them on the half shell or cooking them fresh.\nTry going down to the docks and getting them from the waterman themselves. Support a trade that is slowly leaving our Eastern Shore. Thank a waterman who goes out in all kinds of weather laboring in a trade they must love that is full of obstacles. The weather has cleared, and the watermen are returning to the trade they love. I am on the way to the docks for oysters to prepare some of my favorite seafood dishes.\nEASTERN SHORE OYSTER FRITTERS\nDrain 1 quart of oysters, reserving the juice, and set aside. Beat 2 eggs, add the reserved juice to the egg and add Worcestershire sauce to taste. Add 1 1/2 cups flour with 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and mix well. Add the oysters and lightly mix. Fry in hot oil, browning on both sides. Drain on a paper towel and serve warm. When dropping the fritters in the oil, make sure you have at least 3 oysters to a fritter.\nTRADITIONAL MARYLAND OYSTER STEW\nIn a large saucepan, cook one-pint fresh shucked oysters, with juice, over low heat until edges begin to curl. Add 1 quart of milk, 1/4 cup butter, salt and pepper to taste. You can sprinkle some Old Bay seasoning on top if desired slowly, but do not boil. Serve hot with oyster crackers if desired.\nSCALLOPED OYSTERS\nIn a greased two-quart casserole, place alternate layers of oysters and fresh cracker crumbs, doting each layer with butter. For this process you will need one quart of oysters with liquid, 2 to 3 cups fresh crushed crackers and 1/2 cup butter or 1 stick margarine. You can also sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper to taste. End with a layer of crumbs, and pour one to two cups of milk over the top. Dot the top with remaining butter or margarine and bake at 350 degrees until browned, about 40 to 50 minutes. Makes 6 generous servings.\nOYSTER POT PIE\nIn a large saucepan place 5 or 6 diced potatoes, cleaned and peeled, with 5 or 6 carrots, 2 to 3 cleaned and diced onions, 1/2 pound of chopped ham, and 4 strips of uncooked bacon. Cook until done and add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp parsley flakes and 1/2 tsp oregano. Mix 1 pint crushed tomatoes and the liquor of one pint of oysters. Add this to the already cooked ingredients. Bring to a boil; thicken with some cornstarch. When thick, add one pint of oysters. Cook until the oysters have curled edges. Pour into a baking dish lined with your favorite crust and place a crust over the top. Slightly prick the top crust with a fork, bake at 400 degrees until brown. This is so delicious for supper on a wintry day.\nBACON OYSTER LETTUCE TOMATO\n1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, 2 dozen oysters (freshly shucked), 12 slices thick-cut bacon, vegetable oil (for frying; about 5 cups), 8 slices brioche or white sandwich bread toasted, mayonnaise, bibb lettuce, and sliced tomatoes. Whisk flour, cornmeal, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Working in batches, toss oysters in flour mixture, transfer to a plate. Working in batches, cook bacon in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat until crisp, 10–12 minutes per batch; drain on paper towels. Pour oil into a skillet with bacon fat to a depth of one inch and heat over medium-high heat until oil bubbles immediately when a pinch of cornmeal mixture is added. Working in batches, fry oysters, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about four minutes. Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper. Build sandwiches with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon and fried oysters and serve.\nOYSTER CORNBREAD STUFFING\n8 tbsps unsalted butter (divided), 4 stalks celery (finely chopped), 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp rubbed sage, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp coarse ground black pepper, 6 cups cornbread cubes, 18 ounces oysters (chopped, liquor reserved), 2 cups chicken broth, 2 large eggs. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray a 9x13 baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Add 4 tbsps unsalted butter to a large skillet on medium heat. Add in the celery and onions, cook for 6-8 minutes until translucent. Add in the salt, sage, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper and stir. To a large bowl add the cornbread cubes, vegetable mixture, and oysters and toss. In a second bowl whisk together the reserved oyster liquor, chicken broth, eggs, and melted butter. Pour the mixture over the bowl and toss gently to moisten the cornbread cubes. Pour the mixture into your baking dish and bake, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.\nSINGLE FRIED OYSTERS\n1 pint freshly shucked raw oysters, 2 cups buttermilk, 1¼ cup fine yellow cornmeal, ¾ cup all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp Creole seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 quart peanut oil. While the oil heats, pour the oysters into a colander or strainer and let them drain. Then, rinse with fresh water to wash off any debris or shell fragments. Pour the buttermilk into a medium-sized bowl and dunk the drained oysters. Let them marinate for 15 to 20 minutes. Place the cornmeal, flour, creole seasoning and salt in a shallow bowl or pie plate and whisk to combine. Remove the oysters from the buttermilk one at a time and dredge them in the cornmeal mixture. Toss gently and make sure they are well coated, then shake any excess bread off. Place the coated oysters on a metal cooling rack until all of them have been coated. Letting them sit for a few minutes helps to fuse the breading and buttermilk and keeps the breading from falling off when they are fried. Place a large stockpot, Dutch oven, or cast iron skillet with high sides over medium-high heat and add one to two inches of oil. When the oil reaches 370 degrees, carefully add the oysters, one at a time to fry. Depending on the size of your pan, it works best to fry in batches and only cook six to eight at a time. You do not want to crowd them. (Maintain a consistent heat of 370 degrees by increasing or decreasing the heat under the pan.)Let the oysters fry for about two to three minutes, stirring occasionally or until the breading is light golden brown and the meat is opaque with the edges slightly curled. Use a wire kitchen spider or slotted spoon to remove them from the oil. Place on a paper towel or wire cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all of the oysters are fried and serve immediately. Optional, garnish with fresh lemon or lime slices and serve with your choice of sauce and sides. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "St. Michaels Commissioners bid farewell to duPont, approve ordinances\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 573\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n At the Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting Wednesday evening, leaders discussed Commissioner Thomas \"Tad\" duPont's resignation. The board also approved an ordinance establishing zoning regulations for cannabis businesses and approved the proposed contract with International Computer Services Incorporated for IT work.DUPONT RESIGNATIONCommission President David Breimhurst announced the resignation of Commissioner Thomas \"Tad\" duPont. Breimhurst stated that duPont's resignation was due to health reasons.\nDuPont submitted a letter of resignation on Feb. 6 that Breimhurst read to those at Wednesday's meeting. In the letter, duPont recounted the \"challenging\" three years and nine months the board had while he was in office. Among the challenges duPont listed were navigating the pandemic, creating budgets and many other efforts.\n\"It has been a pleasure to serve, and (I) wish all continued success,\" stated duPont's letter.\nDuPont was most recently elected to serve as a town commissioner in July 2020. He first served as a commissioner from 2010 until resigning in August 2013 over concerns with an ethics ordinance, according to prior Star Democrat reporting.\nThe vacancy on the town commission came three months shy of the town's upcoming election. Three seats, including duPont's, will be up for grabs on May 6.\nBut because duPont's resignation came within 90 days of the next regular election, the vacancy will remain unfilled until the election, according to the town's charter.\nWhen Breimhurst finished reading the letter, he added a personal note on how grateful he was to serve alongside duPont.\n\"I thank Tad for his dedication and devotion to the town of St. Michaels. His love for the town is never ending,\" Breimhurst said.\nCANNABIS BUSINESSES ZONINGThe Commissioners unanimously approved an ordinance changing zoning regulations for cannabis businesses that would permit cannabis dispensaries and processing facilities as a special exception in St. Michaels' general commercial zoning districts.\nThese changes would allow the zoning board to review each application based on factors such as noise, parking and compatibility with the neighborhood.\nA nine-month cannabis moratorium, which temporarily blocked applications, site plans, permits, construction, processing and approval for businesses looking to manufacture or sell recreational or medicinal cannabis in St. Michaels will run its course at the end of the month.\nICSI CONTRACTThe Commissioners voted to renew St. Michaels' contract with International Computer Services Incorporated to assist with the town's IT services. ICSI is the town's current IT consultant and is under contract for another year and a half.\nTown Manager Rob Straubel recommended the approval of the ICSI proposal because it will avoid issues with having multiple service providers and separate maintenance contracts.\nOTHER TOWN BUSINESSMike Bibb, a member of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, presented an annual review of actions taken by the Accountability Board, established in January 2023.\nThis board comprises two parts — the Policy and Procedure Committee and the Accountability and Charging Committee.\nThe Accountability and Charging Committee reviewed 50 complaints filed, and Bidd stated that no cases were made against law enforcement from St. Michael's.\nThe challenges faced by the Police Accountability Board included police recruiting and retention and new juvenile justice laws that make it more difficult to charge juveniles for crimes, Bidd said. He advocated for improved police training and changing laws regarding the statute of limitations for police misconduct charges.\nThe commissioners then discussed reviewing the town's ethics code.\nStraubel recommended developing a board to review the code. The board will comprise five people: one to be a commissioner and four to be community members. The commission will post an announcement to the general public in ConstantContact for volunteers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Event organizers plan to distribute American flags for spectators to wave.\nBut beyond event attendance, the Vietnam veterans behind the event are hoping to gather parade participants and gain assistance with transportation for veterans who are unable to walk the parade route.\n\"We need transportation, but we don't want a bus. We want something where people can see them, the public can wave to them,\" Timms said.\n\"What we're looking for is people to participate,\" added Wayne Hall, president of the VFW's Vietnam Veterans Chapter. \"If anybody has any military vehicles, the collectors, we'd be glad to have them.\"\nThose who wish to be involved in the event can contact 410-310-5748. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

USA Network and NBC will feature live coverage.As the 2023 Ryder Cup gets underway, Team Europe aims to return to its winning ways after what was a dominant victory for Team U.S. in 2021 (19-9). While the Americans on paper look to have more talent, the Europeans have gone 7-3 in the past 10 Ryder Cups prior to the less-than-par performance at Whistling Straits.But Team Europe, now led by fourtime Ryder Cup winner Luke Donald, is going into this tournament having put together a team with a good balance of youth, talent and experience.With the likes of Rory McIlroy, Jon Rham, U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, Shane Lowry and the world No. 4-ranked Viktor Hovland of Norway, who is participating in his second Ryder Cup tournament.Having burst onto the scene making his Ryder Cup debut in 2021, Hovland has been excellent all season, having earned three top-five finishes, including defending his title at the Hero World Challenge. His proven ability to perform in big moments and against the world's top golfers is proven in his performances.The Norwegian has placed in the Top 20 at The Masters, U.S.Open and The Open, and was a runner-up at the PGA Championship. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Before it was over, Phillips said several deputies and school staff were assaulted, and one staff member was taken to the hospital. Phillips did not disclose the extent of their injuries, but he said that everyone was going to be OK.\nThe school safety monitor received multiple blows to the head and was held down on the floor, and three deputies were spat on by students, Phillips said.\n\"That's a biological thing, you just don't know what you're dealing with, now they have to get tests done,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the incident was prompted by something that happened outside of school. He did not provide further details on what incited the fighting.\nThe response from law enforcement was substantial, including 10 Cambridge police officers, seven sheriff's deputies and five state troopers.\n\"A majority of law enforcement in our small geographical area was at C-SD,\" Phillips said.\nPublic details are limited due to the involvement of juveniles, but a 15-year-old was arrested and charged with five counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, failure to obey a lawful order, disturbing the peace, disrupting school activities, obstructing and hindering, and affray, according to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office press release.\nThe second student arrested was 14 years old. The student was charged with one count of second-degree assault, disorderly conduct, failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order, disturbing the peace, disrupting school operations, obstructing and hindering, and affray, according to the press release.\n\"The crowd was actually larger than that (the two arrests). A lot of onlookers with their cameras and stuff,\" Phillips said.\nThe two juveniles were taken to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, then released to their guardians with referrals made to the Department of Juvenile Services, according to the press release.\nThis report may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bakers have been asked to: make two-sided trick-or-treat bags - with one side being light and fun while the other is dark and spooky - out of lemon candies, black licorice and peach rings; decorate cookies with scary self-portraits; craft life-size oozing zombie parts out of cookies, overflowing with gooey marmalades and jams; and create creepy, 3D haunted mirrors - each old and cracked with crunchy treats like kettle chips, pretzels and corn chips.This week, \"Edible stained glass is one of the most colorful and bewitching trends in the cookie world, and four cookie experts make glowing Halloween stainedglass cookies,\" the network promises.\"After one cookier is eliminated, the remaining three masters build giant, elaborate Halloween fun houses that would thrill any Halloween carnival-goer.

Then, in the last round, Food Network has shared that, \"The three remaining cookiers host a séance by making playable spirit boards. To make sure there is maximum 'spirit' in their boards, they will include spirits like apple brandy, cinnamon whiskey, coffee rum and black currant liqueur.\" A rambunctious carnival filled with delicious treats, Season 2 of Food Network's \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" airs new episodes Mondays through October. \n \n Caption: Rosanna Pansino co-hosts \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But we just witnessed a Division I player,\" Cambridge-SD head coach Shawn Tucker said of Chandler, who is headed to Vanderbilt University on a football scholarship. \"He's going to school for football, but we just witnessed what a Division I player looks like. He did everything he needed to do for his team.\"\nAnd he wasted little time doing it, driving hard to the hoop for the game's first points, then making a three-point play that tied the game at 5-5 with 2 minutes, 31 seconds left in the first quarter. Chandler slashed in for yet another drive to give Decatur (21-1) a 9-5 lead, stirring Decatur's fan base into thinking a potential quick getaway was in the making.\nBut Cambridge-SD (20-1) stayed close from beyond the 3-point arc.\nThomas Wilson's 3-pointer brought the Vikings within 9-8. Decatur moved to a 13-8 lead, but Kaleal Johnson's trey made it a two-point game. The Seahawks extended their second-quarter lead to 19-11 on buckets by Chandler, Judah Carmack (nine points) and Solomon David. Koby Ennals (11 points) hit one of his game-high three 3-pointers, drawing the Vikings within 19-14 with a little over 5 minutes left in the half.\nThe Seahawks upped their lead to six, but a field goal and 3 from Sterling Perkins Jr. (team-high 14 points) pulled Cambridge-SD within 20-19 with 2:38 remaining in the first half.\nThe Vikings though wouldn't get any closer, as Decatur used an 8-0 run to close the first half for a 28-19 edge, then widened its cushion to 32-19 less than 2 minutes into the third quarter.\n\"I feel like we forced some shots and then we settled, and then we hit the panic button,\" Tucker said. \"We just weren't disciplined early enough to withstand what Stephen Decatur was doing. Hats off to them. They brought the energy.\"\nCambridge-SD, which hit 10 3-pointers compared to none for Decatur, kept its deficit between 10 and 12 points throughout the third quarter. But Chandler scored 10 of the Seahawks' final 13 points in the third quarter, mostly on drives, to give Decatur a 47-32 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\"He's just a winner,\" Decatur head coach B.J. Johnson said of Chandler. \"There's a reason why he's going to Vanderbilt to play football. He's a coach's dream. And he would not let these guys lose. He's a great teammate. These kids rallied around him, bought into him being the leader, and I'm just so happy for him and all my players.\"\nChandler added six points during Decatur's 10-2 run over the first 4 minutes of the fourth, giving the South champions their biggest lead at 57-35.\n\"Big-time players step up in big-time moments,\" Tucker said of Chandler.\nCambridge-SD narrowed its deficit with a 10-3 game-ending run, but couldn't get any closer than 11.\n\"We just had one of those games,\" Tucker said. \"Unfortunately, it was on the big stage. But fortunately it wasn't in the state playoffs.\"\nThe top-seed in Class 1A East Region II, Cambridge-SD will have a first-round bye and await the winner of Friday's Pocomoke-Crisfield game.\n\"This is a great opportunity to regroup, refocus and get prepared for the playoffs and make a deep run,\" Tucker said. \"And guess what? It's one game. It doesn't define the rest of our season. So we have to continue to move forward and be positive. You have nothing to hang your head about. I know our guys. They're going to bounce back and they're going to make a run.\"\nNotes: It was Decatur's first conference title since 2017. ... The Seahawks will be the No. 1 seed in Class 3A East Region I. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They brought along the Special Olympics torch, called the Flame of Hope, as they traversed the downtown streets of Easton.\nOfficers from the Easton Police Department and Talbot County Sheriff's Office, as well as local officials such as Easton Mayor Megan Cook and Talbot County Council member Dave Stepp, participated in the event. Some local organizations stood outside to cheer on the athletes, including employees from the Town of Easton offices and Rauch Inc.\nWalking down Harrison Street, athlete Hannah McNiece beamed with joy alongside Easton officer Cordero Proctor, as the two each placed a hand on the torch and led the entourage of athletes to the finish line at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nSome officers and athletes took a running route through town and caught up with the walkers toward the finish.\nJill Garvey, management assistant for the Easton Police Department, helps organize the torch run. She said it means a lot when the athletes interact with law enforcement and build relationships with the officers.\nOther counties across the state participate in the torch tradition. Also on Tuesday, Queen Anne's County police officers joined with Kent Island High School students for the Law Enforcement Torch Run.\n\"This event is about more than a run, it's about promoting inclusion, dignity, and respect for every athlete,\" said Queen Anne's Sheriff Gary Hofmann in a press release. \"We're honored to be part of this tradition and proud to stand alongside our partners and students in support of such a meaningful cause.\"\nThe Summer Games for Special Olympics Maryland athletes is set to take place this weekend at Towson University from Friday to Sunday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The goal is to prevent crime and have people know the officers and emergency services personnel who serve their area.\nMegan Coxon, a sergeant with the Easton Police Department, has been a primary force in organizing the event.\n\"We are here for First Night Out, which is a nationwide event. It happens the first Tuesday in August. I probably know half the folks here just because we interact on a daily anyway,\" Coxon said. \"It is like a mini reunion. We get to hang out for a night, and of course you get to meet new people. If I don't know you, I will come talk to you and if I have seen you before, we will reconnect.\"\nShe said she got a lot of help from Jill Garvey, an EPD management assistant, and Lorraine Gould, director of Easton Parks and Recreation.\nCoxon pointed out the law enforcement representatives in attendance.\n\"We have at least ten from EPD. We have sheriff's office, fire marshall's office, Natural Resources Police, Talbot Sheriff's office and MSP. There are about 40 people,\" she said.\nOver a smoking hot grill with about 50 burgers were members of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\n\"We are cooking some good burgers.

We got a decent crowd of people, it is its a good time,\" Aiden Lowery, a firefighter and EMT said.\nMayor Megan Cook was also present, immersed in community.\n\"Talking to people? That is the best part of my job,\" Cook said. \"The sense of community is what is important tonight. I think to see the police department as partners and to get them visible in the community so our neighbors know that they are a resource and they are there to help.\"\nJohn Grothe of the state's fire marshal office had a full kevlar and ballistic shield bomb squad suit and special helmet on display. He is a bomb tech and said the suit weighs 100 pounds.\n\"In the event that there is a device or suspicious package, we try to stay as remote as possible. We try to utilize our bomb robot, but every once in a while, we have to put on the suit and go downrange in person. Night Out is a great opportunity to meet people and have them come up and touch the equipment. We get to explain what we do. It puts a face to the agency,\" Grothe said.\nThere were over 100 community members wandering around, getting food, visiting with friends and getting information from the community service booths.\nJessica Carter, who was sharing an shaved ice with her daughter, said the National Night Out event gives her family an opportunity to see what resources are available to them.\n\"We come every year. The resources. Giving back to the community. Some people may not know what resources are available to them. So it is good. I like the health department and Chesapeake Voyagers,\" Carter said.\nGarvey said she has been working on this event for over a month. She had two massive sheet cakes from Cordova Bakery in her air conditioned vehicle.\n\"It falls into place. I have been planning these for 18 years. It is a free fun family event. The pool is open. Come out and enjoy. There is free food. It is a good community event,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 0.8 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 16.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.\"Millions took to the road for Thanksgiving, and while some regions, like the Great Lakes, saw gas prices rise just in time for travel, most of the nation saw prices hold mostly stable or decline slightly as the national average remains near the lowest level we've seen since 2021,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nThe national average price of diesel has risen 1.1 cents in the last week and stands at $3.514 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.65 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.14 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 0.6 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.00 per gallon today. The national average is down 7.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 23.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nDecember 2, 2023: $3.21 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.23 per gallon)December 2, 2022: $3.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.39 per gallon)December 2, 2021: $3.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.38 per gallon)December 2, 2020: $2.32 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)December 2, 2019: $2.49 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.60 per gallon)December 2, 2018: $2.38 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.43 per gallon)December 2, 2017: $2.46 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.47 per gallon)December 2, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)December 2, 2015: $2.09 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.03 per gallon)December 2, 2014: $2.80 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.00 per gallon, down 8.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.08 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.14 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.20 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.04 per gallon, up 0.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.03 per gallon.\n\"The weeks ahead should feature slight drops in gas prices in most areas, with over 100,000 stations now offering a gallon for $2.99 or less, which should stick around through the holiday shopping season,\" GasBuddy's De Haan said. \"While the potential impacts from tariffs are something to watch, they would have no effect until late January, if implemented at all. For this week, all eyes will be on the previously delayed OPEC+ meeting on Thursday. If they begin to restore oil production, oil prices could soften to the mid-$60s.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Decline of civil dialog in society is a threat\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every Sunday when I was a child, we eagerly awaited the delivery of the Sunday newspaper. It always included a feature with riveting pictures from previous editions.They were not just a collage of all the pictures from previous editions.\nThey were selected by the newspaper's editors thinking not so much on how timely they were at the present, but how timeless they might be going forward.\nIf that program were still in place today, two pictures that most certainly would be selected would be from the 2024 presidential election campaign.\nOne is of former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump after an attempted assassination at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\nIn that surreal picture, Trump is being taken with a bloody hand on a wounded ear, blood on his face and his other hand raised as a defiant fist from the event stage by Secret Service agents.\nAnother picture would be from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nIn that picture, Trump is standing alone on a stage next to the helmet and bunker coat of Corey Comperatore, who was a volunteer firefighter and Trump supporter who attended the Pennsylvania rally.\nCorey died shielding his family from the fusillade that almost killed Trump and seriously wounded two other rally attendees.\nProminently displayed next to Corey's bunker coat and helmet is an American flag.\nTrump appears to be gazing with deep contemplation of and reverence for the memorial for Comperatore.\nIn deeply divided America, both pictures are generating widely different reactions.\nSome Trump detractors claim the assassination was preplanned to generate support for the Trump campaign. They have implied Trump exiting the stage largely under his own power was done to show a stark contrast to a former opponent who often stumbled and needed assistance while walking.\nSome Trump detractors claim the picture of Trump looking at the Comperatore's memorial was staged for nothing more than scoring political points. They question if Trump's hand on the shoulder of the turnout coat was orchestrated and insincere.\nSadly, a significant number of seriously deranged Trump adversaries have posted messages on social media with messages like \"sorry the shooter missed\" and \"hope he [Trump] is killed the next time.\"\nI found the vileness and hate in those messages so disturbing I couldn't read all of them.\nNot all those adversaries are radical fringe malcontents.\nThey include a wide range of elected officials, celebrities and political commentators who have regularly characterized and continue to characterize Donald Trump as a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a fascist, a dictator wanna be and an existential threat to America.\nSome Trump supporters believe the attempted assassination was a deep state conspiracy.\nThey maintain the spectacular failure of security at the event was by design.\nThey also believe constant inflammatory comments from Trump's many adversaries created an environment where the question on an assassination attempt was not if, but when.\nI am not going to engage a debate on the credibility on either side on these deeply held beliefs.\nI am more concerned such debate affirms that an alarming and steady decline of civil dialogue in our society is the greatest existential threat to democracy in America.\nIn today's intensely polarized political environment, it is considered normal and acceptable to disagree by being viciously disagreeable, to listen only to those who share and affirm that their views are the right views. Worst of all, we expect and accept the practice of demonizing anyone, and everyone who doesn't agree with us on every issue all the time.\nWe desperately need a renewed national commitment to critical thinking, listening to others, avoiding group think, respect for differing opinions and acceptance of a system of government where the majority rules, even when that can and does result in public policy decisions that do not have universal agreement.\nMuch easier said than done.\nThe underlying reality of where we are as a society is best captured by the cogent observation of veteran political communications consultant, Frank Luntz: \"It's not what you say or write, it's what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nIn other words — my mind is made up. Don't try to persuade me otherwise with facts.\nWhen dealing the deep divisions caused by the issue of slavery and the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln said, \"A house divided cannot stand.\"\nAmerica has been and is a house divided.\nIf we do not change course soon, we will not stand.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Aren't you?Some days, it seems relentless. A mass shooting at a school. Another youth killed by gun violence. A family on the street after fleeing an abusive partner. A genocide halfway around the world. Brutal wars displacing millions.\nWhen will the violence stop?\nThe answer is: When we take action to stop it, together.\nIt's not impossible. Communities across the country and around the world are showing us how. Violence may be everywhere, but so are the people trying to stop it. And many of them have powerful antidotes to the violence we face.\nDuring the Campaign Nonviolence Action Days, Sept 21-Oct 2, tens of thousands of people will show everyone that another world is possible.\nWhat does a nonviolent world look like? It's not all roses. Conflict happens — but we have better ways to respond without resorting to violence. Many of these strategies will be on display during the upcoming Action Days: Neighborhood safety patrols to prevent gun violence. Unarmed peace teams de-escalating tension in hot conflict zones worldwide. Anti-bullying programs aimed at preventing the next school shooter. Centers that help mothers and families get back on their feet after leaving abusive situations. Protests pushing banks to divest from weapons.\nMore than 4,438 actions and events are planned across the United States and around the world to \"build a culture of peace and active nonviolence, free from war, poverty, racism, and environmental destruction.\"\nAn 11-year-old movement, Campaign Nonviolence aims to end violence in its many forms. This includes direct or physical violence (fights, bullying, war, gun violence) and it also includes systemic violence (houselessness, hunger, mass incarceration and the climate crisis). Going even further, the effort seeks to transform cultural violence as well, the beliefs, attitudes and values that lead to harm and destruction, such as militarism, racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia.\nInstead, Campaign Nonviolence rallies hundreds of groups and organizations who use nonviolent action and promote nonviolent solutions. Sandy Hook Promise trains thousands of schoolchildren in how to counter social isolation — a factor in mass shootings — with Start With Hello Week. The Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons coordinates hundreds of actions to move money out of nukes. The Global Silent Minute synchronizes thousands of people for a moment of prayerful silence for peace on the International Day of Peace, Sept 21. Nonviolent Peaceforce and Cure Violence use de-escalation techniques in conflict zones worldwide to prevent attacks.\nLocal community groups take powerful action in their neighborhoods. Nonviolent Opelika, Alabama, (part of the nationwide Nonviolent Cities Project) offers trainings and talks on their neighborhood patrols to prevent gun violence. Groups in Honolulu reaffirm their Zone of Peace and Nonviolence in a low-income public housing complex. An elementary school in Little Rock, Arkansas, holds a peace march with all the children. In Detroit, Meta Peace Team trains an entire high school in de-escalation skills.\nThere are street theater protests at military bases and teach-ins on nonviolent history, such as M.K. Gandhi or Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. There are peace art contests and concerts in public parks. There are marches for ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine. There are actions to stop environmental destruction and the climate crisis.\nCampaign Nonviolence is gearing up for its largest-ever Action Days stretching between the International Day of Peace Sept 21 to the International Day of Nonviolence on Oct 2. In 2023, more than 5,000 actions were held. With weeks to go, there are already 4,438 actions planned for 2024, and hundreds more expected to be added. The campaign calls for a range of nonviolent actions to be used during the 12 days, including labor strike solidarity, divestment from fossil fuels and weapons, racial healing circles, nonviolence teach-ins, peace demonstrations, and violence de-escalation trainings.\nWhen the violence of our world weighs on your heart, connect to the people working to change it. They bring practical solutions and real-life experience. They persist in showing that something else is possible. They invite you to be part of the solution.\nRivera Sun has written numerous books. She is the editor of Nonviolence News, program coordinator for Campaign Nonviolence, and a nationwide trainer in strategy for nonviolent campaigns. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Israeli Jews safety depends on Palestinians' safety\n\n September 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we enter the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — a time meant for reflecting on where we've strayed from compassion — I keep returning to the dehumanization of Palestinians I've witnessed among the observant Jewish community I grew up in.Over the years, I have spoken out against Israel's assault on Gaza and have been accused of spewing \"ignorant, pathetic Al Jazeera-fueled antisemitic rhetoric.\" \"You will not be admired for your performative moral integrity,\" they admonish. My critics are often otherwise compassionate people, yet their support for the Israeli army remains unwavering.\nMy devotion to Israel was once as absolute as theirs. My parents — both Holocaust survivors — loved Israel second only to their children. They sent me to Zionist schools and summer camps; I grew up immersed in Hebrew music and literature. To me, Israel was not just a country; it was our shield against another Holocaust.\nOnly later did I learn about the forced expulsions of Palestinians and how the Israeli army — which I had been taught was the most moral in the world — had armed death squads in Africa and Latin America. My Israeli cousin trained troops for Idi Amin, whose regime slaughtered half a million Ugandans. When I asked my mother how Israel could have done this, she said everyone hated us, so we took our support where we could get it.\nHer words rattled me. How could this survivor of five concentration camps, who rebuilt her life as a beloved pediatrician, embrace a moral exceptionalism that excused Israel for abetting genocide?\nOver time I came to see her response as born of unspeakable trauma. The Nazis had torn her baby sister from her arms. She had been beaten and starved and witnessed death on a daily basis. Centuries of persecution embeds a fierce tribalism: Protect your own at all costs. But as Rabbi Daniel Bogard points out, \"Trauma does not give us moral clarity. It just makes us traumatized.\" And trauma, left unhealed, breeds more trauma.\nHamas's attack on Oct. 7 reawakened Jews' deepest wound — our ancestral fear of extermination. The Israeli government seized on this to justify a campaign of annihilation: deliberately starving and attacking civilians, restricting humanitarian aid, bombing hospitals and schools.\nEven as Israel escalates its Gaza assault, defenders minimize these horrors. Despite Israeli media restrictions and unprecedented journalist deaths, the emerging evidence looks nothing like self-defense. But when dozens of human rights groups call it genocide, the messengers are discredited to deny the message. \"How naive you are,\" comes the refrain. \"Don't you understand these groups hates us?\"\nThe ease with which my own people excuse these atrocities is chilling.\n\"I'm watching something that is so evidently horrific and inhumane,\" Jon Stewart shared on The Daily Show. Yet when he condemns these actions, he is warned that speaking out threatens Israel's survival, even though it is Israel's actions, not Jewish dissent, that endanger the country most.\nAnd he's right. Studies show Israeli violence fuels antisemitism, which then \"justifies\" more militarization, creating an endless, deadly spiral that both brutalizes Palestinians and endangers Jews everywhere. Furthermore, adds Jewish Currents publisher Daniel May, the argument that Jews are \"at risk no matter where they live and no matter what they do or say,\" distracts us from addressing the conditions that actually drive anti-Israel violence.\nAmong my detractors, acknowledging this context is taboo. Mention decades of occupation, and you're accused of excusing the horrific kidnappings and murders of Oct. 7.\nI believe Israel has a right to exist, but survival built on another people's suffering isn't survival — it's moral collapse that sows the seeds of our own undoing. I understand that tribalism served an evolutionary purpose, forging loyalty in times of threat. But when it hardens into a moral blind spot, it justifies cruelty and brands truth-telling as betrayal.\nAs Israel edges toward near-total obliteration of Gaza, we must confront the trauma-fueled myth of victimhood. Backed by billions in U.S. aid, Israel is no longer David. It has become Goliath. But Goliath's strength is also his weakness; brute force creates more enemies than it destroys.\nYet the community in which I grew up still clings to the fantasy that Israel can eradicate Hamas through its military might. In fact, the opposite is true. As journalist Peter Beinart warns, our destinies are intertwined: \"If you want Israeli Jews to be safe, Palestinians also have to be safe. And Palestinians cannot be safe unless they are free.\"\nThis means abandoning the dehumanizing narrative that Palestinians are terrorist monsters who use children as human shields. Because only by cultivating genuine empathy — by recognizing Palestinians as people just like us, who want safety and dignity for their families — can we break this cycle of trauma. The choice before us is stark: Continue down this path of moral blindness that endangers both peoples, or find the courage to imagine a different story — one where Jewish safety doesn't require Palestinian extinction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So we've assembled a great variety,\" Singleton told the crowd.\nLOCAL TALENT\nSombarkin' played blues and some toe-tapping gospel. Justin Singleton and the Shorebillies performed soulful country-style songs with original lyrics. Philip Dutton and the Alligators rocked out Louisiana-style, and the Blake Thompson Band performed later that day with some classic rock/blues/folk music.\nOn the smaller stage, Maryland Delegate Jay Jacobs presented Singleton a citation of recognition.\nThe station also received a certificate of recognition in March from the Kent County Commissioners.\nWhile the crowd mingled, Singleton's junior students, the class of 2025, took the sound coming from the stage and broadcasted it out for those who couldn't make it that day.\nThe \"on-air\" on the barn wall above the bands wasn't just for decoration.\nSingleton was appreciative of the community support.\n\"It's pretty amazing. Everybody coming together from all walks of life today, celebrating for a common cause.

The ordinance would not apply to restaurants and food service establishments.\nRyan said while the ordinance would apply to the Oxford Market, it would not apply to the deli within the market.\n\"So the sandwiches, subs, things like that that would be wrapped in plastic would continue to be in plastic,\" she said.\nDuring the public hearing, some local business owners and employees expressed their concerns with the proposed ordinance. Graham Norbury, the general manager at Safe Harbor Oxford, said that while this may be a national issue, he doesn't observe plastic bags being littered often in Oxford.\n\"Why is restricting a retailer's right to choose the best delivery mechanism for their products, why is that something that the commissioners feel necessary?\" he asked.\nOxford Vintage & Trade owner Barbara Ranson said in her six years of being in business in Oxford, she has always used paper bags. She said she doesn't understand why the commissioners are looking at this legislation when \"it may or may not target three very small businesses.\"\n\"So it seems to me (like) legislation looking for a problem, and I don't understand why we would spend one minute on this,\" she said, receiving some applause from residents in the audience.\nRanson also brought up a part of the ordinance that would require retail establishments to charge a 10 cent fee — which the retail establishment would keep — for each paper bag it hands out to customers. She said that having to charge and keep track of that would take up time and labor and would just be another thing that the town needs to enforce.\n\"And who's going to do that?\" she asked. \"Because we already have ordinances that are not enforced because we don't have anybody to do them.\"\nResident David Donovan, who is in support of the ordinance, acknowledged that it won't solve the global problem.\n\"But if every one of us in every little town stands up and does their share, you do solve a problem,\" he said.\nResident Rose Donovan said she considers this to be a \"common sense ordinance.\" She said this is a way to stop using plastic bags \"where we can.\"\nCommissioner Katrina Greer said she feels passionately about banning plastic, but Oxford is facing a lot of other important issues right now.\n\"So I would like to find a way forward with this. But perhaps just not now,\" she said, adding that there is more commissioners should consider regarding the ordinance.\nBefore the commissioners voted unanimously to table the ordinance, Ryan brought up the idea of giving retail establishments an incentive to not use plastic bags, rather than banning them. She said the commissioners could consider a tax incentive, among other possible incentives.\nCommission President Norm Bell said they should bring all of these ideas to the table before they make a decision. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What if certain watershed events in American history had never occurred or had occurred much differently?One such watershed event was the war in Vietnam.\nHistorians to this day ask what if decisions made on escalating or de-escalating that war had been made by President John Kennedy and not by President Lyndon Johnson.\nMilitary historian Fred Kaplan makes a compelling case that if Kennedy had not been assassinated in November 1963, the outcome and duration of that war would have been much different.\nKaplan makes his case based on Kennedy's actions and decisions during the biggest crisis of his presidency — the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nPrior to that crisis, Kennedy's leadership capabilities were challenged regularly by his opponents. They were especially scornful of his disastrous Bay of Pig's invasion of Cuba in April 1961 and his disastrous summit meeting with Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev in June 1961. Following that summit Kennedy privately acknowledged \"he just beat the hell out of me.\"\nPerhaps those two events emboldened Khrushchev to place Soviet medium- and long-range nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962.\nThat decision resulted a 13-day period where World War III between America and the Soviet Union was more likely than ever before or since.\nThe fact that it did not is a testament to Kennedy's masterful leadership skills.\nWhen Kennedy was made aware of that grave threat to from nuclear missiles less than 90 miles from America, he assembled a group of civilian and military advisors to evaluate and oversee an appropriate American response.\nThose advisers included the eight members of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Undersecretary of State George Ball and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\nWith one exception (George Ball), Kennedy's advisers strongly supported direct military action including bombing the missile sites and invading Cuba.\nAfter 13 days of a tense standoff between the two superpowers, Khrushchev secretly and unexpectedly offered a deal to end the crisis. The deal terms were Russia would remove their nuclear missiles in Cuba that were pointed at American targets if America would remove American nuclear missiles in Turkey pointed at targets in the Soviet Union\nKennedy's advisers with one exception (Ball) vehemently opposed the deal. They continued to support plans drawn up by the military and Defense Secretary McNamara that called for 500 conventional bombing sorties of the Soviet missile sites and air bases daily for seven days, followed by an invasion of Cuba.\nFollowing receipt of the Khrushchev offer McGeorge Bundy bluntly told Kennedy — \"I think we should tell you … the universal assessment of everyone in the government who's connected with the alliance problem (NATO) is if we appear to be trading the defense of Turkey for the threat in Cuba, we will face a radical decline.\" Secretary McNamara ended his review of suggested next steps with \"before we attack Cuba.\"\nAfter listening to his adviser's opinions Kennedy, told them \"I'm just thinking about what we're going to have to do in a day or so. … Five hundred sorties … and possibly an invasion, all because we wouldn't take missiles out of Turkey. And we all know how quickly everybody's courage goes when the blood starts to flow, and that's what's going to happen in NATO … when we start these things and the Soviets grab Berlin, and everybody's going to say, 'Well, this Khrushchev offer was a pretty good proposition.\"\nKennedy knew that the American missiles in Turkey were rapidly becoming obsolete and had no long-term military value to America.\nHe told his advisers calmly but resolutely he was sending his brother Bobby (who bitterly opposed the deal) to tell the Soviet ambassador to the United States that America was accepting the Khrushchev proposal.\nIt was a moment reminiscent of a Cabinet Meeting in the White House 100 years earlier when President Lincoln polled his cabinet members on his proposed new battle strategy for the Civil war. Every member of Lincoln's Cabinet voted no. Lincoln said \"I vote aye. The ayes win.\"\nKennedy obviously knew that as commander in chief he could overrule his advisers when he chose to do so.\nFollowing Kennedys assassination, Lyndon Johnson was either unwilling or unable to overrule his advisers on their repeated calls to escalate the war in Vietnam. Ironically, many of those advisers (except again George Ball) repeatedly advised Johnson for escalation in Vietnam were the same advisers overruled by Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.\nKaplan's answer to the \"what if\" question on the course of Vietnam war is LBJ plunged deeply into the war and JFK would not have.\nBased on Kaplan's analysis of what if JFK had lived, America would have avoided the great tragedy of a futile and immensely divisive war that resulted in more than 58,000 American deaths and countless veterans returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nI agree.\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commissioners holds public hearing on licensing kennels\n\n July 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 773\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — The Kent County commissioners talked about not \"releasing the hounds,\" but gave consideration to licensing their kennel, at their regularly scheduled meeting on June 24.Due to recent legislative changes, the commissioners now sit as the Fox Hunting Club Dog Kennel Licensing board.\nTheir first applicant was The Wicomico Hunt Club, a club in existence since the 1920s, seeking to preserve a rich history of safely hunting red foxes on horseback with hounds along fields, forest and wetlands beside rivers and tributaries of the Bay.\nApproval of the application would enable the club to build the kennel for the hounds on the 20 acre Worton farm that until recently, was prohibited from housing more than five dogs since it is located in a Resource Conservation District.\nDirector of Planning, Housing and Zoning Bill Mackey explained that last year the club sought to change that law with an application for a text amendment.\nAttorney Genevieve Macfarlane acting as counsel to the club, said the text amendment sought to create a definition for kennels specific to organized fox hunting clubs, and to amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit such kennels within the RCD zone.\nHowever, while in that process, during a meeting with the Planning Commission, some public outcry arose concerning potential noise and safety issues over the hounds. The planning staff then recommended the commissioners hold certain licensing requirements to protect both the club and the public.\nThis past year, the hunt club has worked with the County to address those concerns and a text amendment was approved to allow hounds in the RCD zone on the condition a Fox Hunting Kennel Licensing Board and licensing scheme be put in place.\nThe county commissioners act as the oversight board and are responsible for implementing a regulatory framework specific to the licensing of such facilities.\n\"We've been called worse than that,\" Commission President Ron Fithian quipped when they were deemed the Fox Hunting Club Dog Kennel Licensing Board.\nAt the June 24 meeting, Deputy Director of Planning, Housing and Zoning Carla Gerber submitted the club's application for a kennel license as well as permission to build a temporary kennel to house 30 fox hunting hounds at Worton.\nGerber said the application met all the requirements as outlined in the new chapter 64 under Animals, article 62.\nAt these proceedings, Club Huntsman Eden Kloetzli was accompanied by supporters of the club, Attorney Genevieve Macfarlane lending counsel, Master of Fox Hounds Ed Fry, and member Dan O'Toole. Together they responded to concerns about potential noise and safety issues.\nO' Toole, huntsman with Mount Carmel Hounds, stated he has been housing hounds on his Baltimore County property for 65 years. Although the area is far less rural than Kent, he has not had any issues so far. It relies on good communication with neighbors.\nO' Toole has been helping design the club's kennel and suggested using mass-loaded vinyl on the fencing for effective sound proofing.\nKloetzli added that elevation changes on the property, the surrounding woods, the acoustic panelling on the fence and the natural isolation of the area, will help cut down on noise. They plan on growing a sound barrier with cedar trees as well.\nKloetzli assured them that the previous property owners of the farm had a working septic system used for cattle which would suit their purposes. Waste gets pumped out and disposed of properly and there will be no smell since they sanitize everyday.\nPreviously the hounds were housed at Tolchester and although challenging, Kloetzli learned from that experience, O'Toole pointed out.\nKloetzli said if the hounds are limited to what they see, they will be happy and not prone to bark as much.\nSince many of these regulations are similar to the requirements they adhere to in Baltimore County, O'Toole applauded the County's process.\nThe club is the only recognized one on the Eastern Shore, Fry said, one of 142 clubs around the country. They adhere to Master Fox Hounds Association where they follow a strict code of how operations are run, the sanitary condition of the kennels and updated vaccinations.\nThe hounds all have their shots and are microchipped and soon will be wearing identifiable collars, Kloetzli pointed out.\nCommission President Ron Fithian stated being a board member for dog kennel licensing is a new experience for them but by being so, if any complaints arise, they now have a system to address it.\nWith no voiced opposition to building the kennels during the hearing, Commissioner John Price moved to close it out. The application will be considered for a vote on July 8.\nThe club is cherished by many on the Eastern Shore and today, is the only remaining hunt sanctioned by the Masters of Foxhounds Association on the Delmarva Peninsula. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "QA’s, Easton hoping for a Shore thing\n\n November 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 841\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n They battled each other in one of the season's more memorable duels, playing 80 scoreless minutes before settling things in 1v1s.That was Oct. 1, when Queen Anne's County High's field hockey team outlasted Easton in a shootout, part of a 14-game Lions' unbeaten streak.\nThe Warriors have not lost since that clash, reeling off eight straight victories.\nWednesday, 36 days later after that marathon, Queen Anne's and Easton prepare to play in the Class 2A state semifinals at Glen Burnie High School, not against each other, but hoping to possibly create the first all-Eastern Shore state final since 1997.\n\"How great would it be?\" Queen Anne's longtime head coach Shana Corder asked rhetorically. \"I am rooting for Easton and Queen Anne's to win this one. I think that would be an awesome setup.\"\nWarrior head coach Kim Neff seconded that notion.\n\"That would be so wild,\" Neff said of an all-Shore final that hasn't happened since Pocomoke defeated Kent County in the 1997 Class 1A championship. \"That would be so cool.\"\nOf course, Corder and Neff each know that dream match doesn't happen unless their respective teams get past a pair of unbeatens tonight.\nThird-seeded Queen Anne's (13-1-1) goes first, when it plays three-time defending state champion and No. 2 seed Glenelg (15-0) at 5:30 p.m. Fourth-seeded Easton (12-3) follows in a meeting with No. 1 seed Manchester Valley (15-0) at 7:30 p.m.\n\"OK. So we're not undefeated,\" Corder said. \"We're the underdog.\"\nThe Lions may have thought they would be wearing that underdog tag through at least part of this season after graduating a number of standouts off last year's 15-1 team that posted 14 shutouts and reached the state semifinals. Corder honestly thought this would be a rebuild season, since the entire defense from a year ago — with the exception of goalie Cassidy Alexander — was gone.\nBut after a season-opening loss at Pocomoke, Corder changed her position.\n\"I think they felt, 'Oh, we're not going to be as good,'\" Corder said. \"'We are not as good as this team.' But I was like, 'We are as good. You can't set yourself up to think you're a failure.' I think losing that game was the best blessing we've gotten all year.\n\"I saw their faces and they weren't used to losing, all my returners,\" Corder continued. \"And I felt like they didn't like to lose. So I thought that gave them the drive to want to win. I felt that was our turning point.\"\nSince then the Lions, behind their one-two goalie punch of Caroline Kimball and Alexander, and a rebuilt defense, have gone unbeaten, which included winning their second straight Bayside Conference and regional championships — a first in program history — and recording 11 shutouts.\n\"I feel every team we play has given us their best game because we did so well (last year),\" Corder said. \"They understand pressure. They've been here before. All the returners know what this feels like. Hopefully they already felt the pressure. We've had 1v1 games, overtime, blah, blah, blah. I'm just hoping they are able to rise to the occasion Wednesday.\"\nThough Easton didn't have a 2023 season that compared to Queen Anne's, Neff was filled with optimism at the outset of this season.\n\"I knew we were capable of getting this far,\" Neff said. \"A lot of these girls I've coached since they were in kindergarten, and I know their potential. It was the most athletic group that I have seen (during preseason tryouts). I think them playing some travel ball together and being on rec teams together, they know each other well, which helps.\"\nBut Easton's record was sitting at 4-3 after the 1v1 loss to Queen Anne's. The Warriors moved to 5-3 with a shutout of Kent County.\nThen came a 3-2 overtime victory over Pocomoke.\n\"We have a long history with Pocomoke,\" Neff said. \"And Pocomoke tends to get the victories. So I think that game, and going into overtime, and doing what they did really solidified them. Like I knew and I had the confidence in them. But I think it solidified the confidence in them, like, 'We can do this.'\"\nSince that victory, Easton has defeated perennial Bayside heavyweight Kent Island 1-0 in overtime. The Warriors defeated Parkside 2-1 in overtime in a 2A East Region II semifinal, then beat Stephen Decatur 2-1 with 11 seconds remaining in regulation in the region final. Easton continued its trend for the dramatic last Thursday, defeating Hereford in a 1v1 in a state quarterfinal, placing the Warriors in the state semifinals for the first time since 2021.\n\"I told them, 'You've earned your spot there,'\" Neff said. \"'We're all good teams. We made it to the top four. We're not looking at records because every day's a clean slate for every team. We haven't seen them (Manchester Valley). They haven't seen us. And so we're going in and we're playing our game. They're ready.\"\nNotes: Wednesday's winners will meet for the state final on Saturday at Stevenson University at 11 a.m.. … Third-seeded Pocomoke plays No. 2 seed Fallston Wednesday in a 1A state semifinal at Crofton High. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

American flags whipped in the wind along with many Military Order of the Purple Heart flags honoring those killed or wounded in action.\n\"There's a lot of tradition here,\" Arcoraci said of the annual flag display.\nThe Eastern Shore Veterans Cemetery is one of five official veterans cemeteries in the state and the only one on the Eastern Shore. Arcoraci noted it was the first ever Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families cemetery, opening in 1976.\nCivil War veteran John Henry Blades was the first person to be buried at the cemetery. Today, there are around 8,000 burials and there's room for thousands more, Arcoraci said. He said the state also recently relaxed its residency requirements, allowing some families from nearby Delaware to place veterans at the Hurlock cemetery.\nThe cemetery features a unique design, with the burial sites forming curves facing the American flag in the middle of the cemetery.\nOnce the flags were placed, Mary Alice Jones and her son Bill Jones took some time to visit the graves of relatives, including Korean War U.S. Army veteran Joseph Horenstein.\nMary Alice Jones said it's important to remember and honor veterans no matter the time of year.\nWhile Memorial Day was widely celebrated Monday, the Eastern Shore Veterans Cemetery commemorates Memorial Day later this week with an annual program.\nAt 1:30 p.m. Friday, the cemetery will host a Memorial Day program open to the public. It will include remarks from American Legion members and guest speaker Ross Cohen, acting secretary of the Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families.\nMemorial Day was originally observed on May 30 in the years after the Civil War. That tradition continued through much of the 20th century before a federal act moved it to the last Monday in May.\nArcoraci said the cemetery and its committee continues the May 30 program because of tradition. \"I'm expecting quite a crowd,\" he added.\nThe Eastern Shore Veterans Cemetery partners with a number of local veteran groups and organizations, including local American Legions.\n\"This cemetery's about community involvement,\" he said.\nThe Eastern Shore Veterans Cemetery is located at 6827 E New Market Ellwood Road, Hurlock, MD, 21643.\nThis article has been updated to correct the name of Friday's guest speaker, Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families acting Secretary Ross Cohen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jeff Ghrist introduced legislation Feb. 9 aimed at giving local jurisdictions the authority to regulate the storage of dissolved air flotation by-products, otherwise known as DAF residuals.\"I want to make sure that the local governing bodies can do that on their own without any ambiguity, because small counties like Caroline … can't afford to be sued,\" Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said in a Feb. 21 interview.\nHouse Bill 1404 was co-sponsored by Del. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) and Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) as well as two Cecil County legislators and three from the western shore. It is cross-filed with Senate Bill 1149, sponsored by Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nGhrist's bill addresses an issue the Caroline County Commissioners have been dealing with in their legislation process since mid-December. He said he discussed the DAF storage issue with the commissioners, the Eastern Shore delegation and the Maryland Farm Bureau.\nNeither the state's Department of the Environment nor the Department of Agriculture have jurisdiction over regulating or controlling the storage of DAF residuals, \"and so we have at least one person taking advantage of that loophole in the law,\" he said.\n\"Whether or not (Love's bill) removes any ambiguity (regarding) how much control the county commissioners have in storage, that remains to be seen,\" Ghrist said. \"But I just want to make sure that after this legislation is passed that one, it goes far enough to ensure that we're not going to have DAF being stored anywhere near our towns, and two, if it doesn't go far enough, I want to make sure that the local governing bodies can (restrict it) on their own, without any ambiguity.\"\nGhrist said he wanted to make sure that the case would have no standing in court if \"anybody decided to sue the county.\"\nThe bill is \"just a placeholder,\" Ghrist said. If a separate bill, HB991 sponsored by Del. Sara Love (D-Montgomery) addresses the DAF storage issue and is passed, Ghrist said he may consider withdrawing his.\nIf enacted, HB991 would establish an industrial sludge utilization permit administered and enforced by the Department of the Environment.\nGhrist's bill will be considered 1 p.m. March 8 by the Environment and Transportation Committee.\nLove's bill will go to the same committee 1 p.m. March 5.\nFor more information on legislation in the 2024 Maryland General Assembly, visit mgaleg.maryland.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Perhaps the only challenge is maintaining self-control when passing the colorful piles of peak-season tomatoes at the market.Admittedly, they are hard to resist. Cherries, heirlooms and Early Girls in vibrant shades of the sun and summer challenge restraint. It's easy to be greedy and fill the basket with an array of these beauties without a plan for how to use them. While I am not here to judge or to advise you on any indulgence issues, I do have a recipe to help you use your exuberant surplus.This recipe is a wonderful summer salad with ingredients that scream \"garden-fresh.\" You might be tempted to call it a pasta salad, but as you can see, the emphasis is on the vegetables rather than a carbladen bowl of pasta interspersed with a few green leaves. Dainty orzo steps into the pasta role. Its petite rice shape won't overwhelm the bowl, allowing the tomatoes and greens to shine as they should. Fresh, creamy mozzarella and zippy Parmigiano-Reggiano round out the flavors, with a balsamic drizzle that binds the salad with a sweet and puckery kick.Serve the salad slightly warm or at room temperature.You can cook the orzo in advance and refrigerate until assembling the salad.TOMATO, ARUGULA AND ORZO SALADActive time: 20 minutes Total time: 20 minutes, plus cooling time for the orzo Yield: Serves 4 Dressing:2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salad:1 1/3 cups orzo 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 ounces baby arugula, about 4 packed cups 6 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into bite-size pieces 8 to 10 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, halved 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Freshly ground black pepper Whisk the vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add the oil and whisk to emulsify.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the orzo and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes.Drain. Transfer the orzo to a large, shallow serving bowl and stir in the oil and salt.Cool to lukewarm or room temperature. (Alternatively, refrigerate the pasta until use. Let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before assembling the salad.)Spread the arugula over the pasta, then add the mozzarella, tomatoes, olives and basil. Drizzle half of the dressing over the salad and gently mix to combine. Garnish with additional basil, the Parmigiano-Reggiano and a generous grind of black pepper. Drizzle with additional dressing to taste.

Kevin Bateman received 30 votes.Phoenix said 140 absentee ballots remain to be counted Wednesday afternoon. Gunsallus holds a 139-vote lead over Willey.A steady flow of voters poured into Easton's firehouse Tuesday as residents cast their ballots for the next president of the Town Council. Just over 1,900 ballots were cast during in-person voting.Early in the morning, candidates for Easton Town Council president stood beneath tents as a stream of voters passed them by. There wasn't a hard sell, it was more of a morning greeting as the light slanted onto the firehouse. Voters went in and did their civic duty. There weren't big lines at 9 a.m.Turnout at the polls was busy and steady as election day progressed, Phoenix said.But in this contentious election cycle, agitation simmered just beneath the surface between some of the candidates.Al Silverstein sat alone while the other three - Frank Gunsallus, Kevin Bateman, and former Mayor Robert Willey - spoke amiably. There was even a minor turf war when Gunsallus placed a sign too close to Silverstein's camp. Within seconds it got moved back and replanted.Willey, a former town council president and mayor himself, has been running for office in Easton since 1992. He brought doughnuts.As a longtime local politician, Willey knew there would be a lot to do early on election morning. He knew the day would be long as well, especially in waiting on a vote tally.\"But this election has gotten to be a little more demanding than some in the past,\" he said. \"I hope (when) it is over with everybody (can) still talk to each other when they leave.\" \"This is my 10th election,\" he said. \"This has become the most pointed, the most mean-spirited. I would not want to go through this again.\" Willey said win or lose, this was his last run.Leaning on a tent pole was Bateman.\"It is a relief to have election day here, especially after the last two weeks. All the hate mailers and hate speech have gone forth,\" he said.\"I want to see that Easton is governed equally for all of Easton - not just certain communities, but that all communities are included.\" Gunsallus said he was feeling good about the election, mentioning that he heard positive feedback from the community.\"I am thankful to everyone who has shown support and for all the amazing people I have met along the way,\" he said. \"Irregardless of what happens, I am happy to have had this experience.\" Silverstein stood up to greet each voter as they passed. Some stopped to voice their support.A former councilman serving Easton's Ward 1, Silverstein said it's exciting to be outside the polls on election day and to thank the electorate for coming out.\"I would encourage anybody who wants to change their community for the better to throw their hat in the ring,\" he said. \"I congratulate all my opponents for getting out there and getting their positions known. I think it is the greatest part of the American system.\" One community member, Shari Wilcoxon, was fired up enough to hold a Gunsallus sign in front of her car.\"What happens in the Town of Easton matters greatly to Talbot County,\" she said. \"I think it is time for some new leadership.\" Carol Voyles of Easton was happy to vote and do her civic duty.\"It troubles me that our communities are so divided,\" she said. \"When it is over, we are going to celebrate.\" \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nFormer Easton Mayor Robert Willey gets out his signs the morning of the election for town council president.

Despite mixed public reactions at past town meetings, no members of the public spoke Monday evening.The proposal comes from Lane Engineering on behalf of NAI Saturn Eastern and Safeway, along with Miller Development Corporation, the potential developers of the project. It includes 24 partially-connected townhomes and nine standalone units. The property, which has been vacant since 2017, sits at 139 N Washington St.\nCouncil members mentioned discussions with developers about a per-unit contribution to the town's affordable housing efforts. Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry said it's her \"understanding that the developer has agreed\" to those contributions.\n\"We discussed the possibility of a $10,000 per-unit support of the affordable housing fund,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said, \"with $5,000 coming at the building permit stage and $5,000 at the moment of getting the permit of occupancy.\"\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said she will work with Ryan Showalter, an attorney representing Miller Development Corporation, in the lead up to the next town meeting Aug. 19 so that a potential vote on the proposal comes to the council.\nFIRE DEPARTMENTSonny Jones, chief of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, presented a report to the Town Council on Monday detailing the station's activity through the month of July.\nAs of July 31, the department has responded to 540 fire or rescue incidents this year, 255 of which came in the months of May, June and July, Jones said.\n\"I really want to point out that this is an all-volunteer organization, and as of July 31, our members have spent 8,515.07 hours in service to the community,\" Jones told the council. \"And I'm very, very proud of all the men and women who do that.\"\nJones pointed out that Mondays around 3 p.m. tend to be the department's busiest time. He also said there's been a decrease in the number of false alarms.\n\"(Ward 2 Council Member Don) Abbatiello has assisted us with that in taking great strides to try to reduce the amount of false alarms,\" Jones said. \"We have done some outreach to businesses which were problematic, and encouraged them to have a system to maintain.\"\nJones also said the fire department has raised $3.2 million to date for a training facility project that has been in the works. He said a construction contract was awarded to Willow Construction.\nThe new training facility, which will be located at 9095 Mistletoe Drive in Easton, will be a hub for all volunteer firefighters across the Mid-Shore region who are looking for specialized education.\n\"This is an exciting project for us,\" Jones said. \"It's the first of its kind in the area … And we're going to see some significant start in September for the building of that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Shrimp, an Eastern Shore tradition\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1529\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Growing up on the farm, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay as well as the many rivers, we ate many types of seafood, but shrimp was not my favorite dish.Shrimp has a long history in the Delmarva region, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries. While not typically fished with a large-scale commercial harvest due to gear restrictions like the beam trawl ban, shrimp populations have been present and studied for decades. Recent observations suggest increasing shrimp populations in the area, possibly due to factors like warming waters.\nShrimp have always been found around the Chesapeake Bay, which is replete with the marshy, muddy habitat they love. Shrimp like to bury in sediment and can be found in both the Bay and its river estuaries, from shallow to deep water. Around the last week of October each year, a sudden drop in temperature drives the shrimp to funnel out of the Bay and into the southern Atlantic, where the water is a little warmer.\nThe shrimping industry is most popular in the Gulf states of Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Texas. In the last five years, shrimp sales volume increased from 275 million pounds to 415 million. The percentage of households buying fish has also increased from 44.2% to 48.6%. This growth is seen in all areas of the country.\nShrimp is an excellent, affordable meal option for families. Shrimp can be enjoyed as an appetizer, snack, main course or side dish. Shrimp is a great addition to many popular favorites as it's easy to toss some shrimp into a creamy pasta or grill up some prawns to top your preferred cut of steak.\nIn later years, I discovered shrimp and became a \"shrimp lover.\" My parents really didn't care for shrimp, so therefore when I became a cook in my own kitchen, I ventured into exploring many different foods. The same happens generation after generation, introductions to different foods.\nJUMBO STEAMED SHRIMP\n1/2 cup vinegar, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 3/4 cup water, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 lbs jumbo shrimp.\nIn a medium sized saucepan combine vinegar, Old Bay, water and salt. Bring these ingredients to a boil. Add shrimp. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the liquid. Cover and steam for 5 to 6 minutes or until tender. Drain and serve.\nSHRIMP AND RICE\n1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper, 3 tbsps flour, small can tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp hot sauce, 1 1.2 lbs pre-cooked shrimp, rice.\nMelt butter, add onion and green pepper, mix well with the butter. Mix in flour, stirring until bubbly. Add tomato sauce, water and hot sauce. Cook slowly for about 10 minutes. Add shrimp and cook slowly for another 10-15 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.\nSHRIMP SCAMPI\n1 1/2 cups olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 4 crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 4 lbs raw shrimp (shelled and deveined).\nIn a large skillet, place olive oil, lemon juice, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Heat thoroughly and add shrimp. Stir well and cook until the shrimp are pink. Serve with rice.\nSHRIMP STIR FRY\n2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 lb shrimp (peeled and deveined), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 small head of broccoli (cut into small florets), 1 red bell pepper (seeds and ribs removed, thinly sliced), 8 oz sugar snap peas, 3 garlic cloves (minced), 1 tbsp finely chopped peeled ginger, 1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce, juice of 1 lime, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.\nIn a large wok or skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add shrimp; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, turning halfway through, until pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a plate. In the same skillet over medium heat, heat sesame oil. Add broccoli, bell pepper, and peas and cook, stirring and adding a splash of water if browning too quickly, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Add to the skillet and toss to coat. Add shrimp and cook, tossing frequently, until heated through, about 2 minutes.\nOLD BAY SHRIMP BURRITOS\nFor Old Bay aioli: 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tsp Sriracha, 3/4 tsp fresh lime juice, 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning (plus more for serving), Kosher salt. For shrimp filling: 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 small green bell pepper (diced), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1 lb small shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails removed), 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp paprika, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper. For assembling burrito: 4 large flour tortillas (warmed), 1 cup cooked long-grain white rice, 1 cup cooked black beans (rinsed and drained), 3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese, 1 cup shredded lettuce, 1 cup pico de gallo (drained), 1 avocado (thinly sliced), 2 tbsps chopped chives (plus more for serving).\nMake aioli: Whisk together mayo, Sriracha, lime juice, Old Bay, and 1 teaspoon water. Season with salt, if desired. Make shrimp filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add oil, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in shrimp, cumin, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Assemble burritos: Lay a tortilla on a serving plate. Add 1/4 cup each of the rice and beans. Top with ¼ each of the shrimp filling, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and avocado slices. Sprinkle with chives and drizzle with aioli. Roll the burrito tightly and repeat with remaining tortillas and ingredients. Slice each burrito in half and serve with more aioli, Old Bay and chives.\nSWEET CORN, SHRIMP & RICE SKILLET\n1/2 cup basmati rice, 1 bunch scallions (divided), 1 medium red bell pepper (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (5 roughly chopped, 1 minced), 4 tbsps white miso, 1-inch piece ginger (thinly sliced), 1 1/4 tsp turmeric powder (divided), 1 tsp Kosher salt (plus more for seasoning), 1 tsp granulated sugar (optional), 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional), 4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil (divided), 1/2 lb medium shrimp (peeled and cleaned), freshly ground black pepper, 3/4 cup water, 1 cup frozen corn (rinsed in warm water and drained), lime wedges for serving.\nRinse rice well, until water runs clear, then transfer to a medium bowl and cover with water. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cook 5 roughly chopped garlic cloves and ginger in a pan for around 1 minute. Remove roots and ends from 4 green onions and roughly chop into pieces. Add chopped scallions to blender or food processor, along with the bell pepper, garlic cloves, miso, ginger, 1 teaspoon turmeric, salt, and sugar and cayenne if using. Blend until all ingredients are finely chopped and thoroughly mixed, then slowly drizzle in 3 tablespoons olive oil while running the food processor or blender. Blend until mixture is smooth. Pat shrimp dry and transfer to a medium bowl. Add remaining turmeric and minced garlic clove, and season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch oven safe skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and cook until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove cooked shrimp into a bowl just big enough to fit and cover with a plate to keep warm. Return the skillet to heat and add prepared puree. Cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid has cooked out and paste has darkened, 8 to 10 minutes. (You'll know it's done when the oil starts to separate from the paste! Reduce heat to medium and whisk in water until smooth. Strain rice, and add rice and corn. Drain any cooking juices from the shrimp into the skillet, using the plate to keep the shrimp from falling in. (Be sure to keep shrimp covered. Stir to incorporate everything, then bring mixture up to a simmer. Place in a preheated oven and cover tightly with a lid or sheet pan. Bake until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 23 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining green onions for garnish. Fluff rice with a fork, then scoop into serving dishes. Top with cooked shrimp and green onions and serve with lime wedges on the side.\nSHEET PAN SHRIMP\n1 lb. baby red potatoes (quartered), 1 1/2 lb raw medium shrimp (peeled and deveined), 2 ears of corn (cut crosswise into 4 pieces each), 2 links smoked andouille sausage (thinly sliced), 2 lemons (sliced), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 2 tbsps melted butter, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 2 tbsps freshly chopped parsley for garnish.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. In a large bowl, combine cooked potatoes, shrimp, corn, sausage, lemons, garlic powder, Old Bay, melted butter, and oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss until combined, then divide between two large baking sheets. Bake until shrimp is cooked through and corn is tender, 13 to 15 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Greensboro adds security measures, hears resident feedback after water system 'sabotage'\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO — Town employees discussed an apparent \"sabotage\" of Greensboro's water system and heard feedback from residents during a Thursday evening Town Council meeting.On July 29, the town announced that the its water and wastewater contract operator, Susquehanna Operational Services, conducted tests throughout town, finding higher than normal chlorine levels. It came after a bevy of complaints from concerned residents, who said the water had a chlorine-like taste and smell the weekend prior.\nThe town concluded that \"one of the chlorine regulators had been tampered with\" in the tower wells. In a press release, it was deemed \"deliberate sabotage,\" and the town stated the Caroline County Sheriff's Office would conduct an investigation.\nBrandon Cunningham, the town's public works supervisor, provided an update Thursday on security measures put in place in days since. Cunningham said \"the locks have all been changed to all the well houses.\"\nKeys were given to members of Susquehanna Operational Services, and himself and the town manager in case of emergency, he said.\nHe also said he's been in contact with SafeHouse, a security system company, to potentially procure security cameras and keypads. Cunningham said SafeHouse security measures, including adding cameras, would cost $15,865.54.\nCouncilmember Joe Noon said he'd \"like a couple more bids\" for the cameras and security additions. Carly Landolfi, assistant to the town attorney, told councilmembers they could vote on a \"contingent\" motion to purchase the SafeHouse services, depending on whether she finds the town must legally seek out other bids or not.\nMayor David Spencer said he's visited the wells and vouched for security services to be adopted as soon as possible.\n\"I really don't want to push this off,\" Spencer said. Councilmember Pete Breila made a motion to pass the \"contingent\" motion, which was seconded by Councilmember Bob Harrison.\nPUBLIC COMMENTMultiple residents expressed concerns about the water quality and the town's response to councilmembers Thursday.\n\"The word sabotage, that's a pretty extensive word,\" resident Chris Mason said. \"It means a lot, and it puts fear in the community.\"\nMason continued, questioning why the investigation is being conducted by Caroline County Sheriff's Office and not the Greensboro Police Department. He added that he wished the town had passed out water to residents during the days in which the chlorine-like taste and smell was apparent.\n\"Who has access to sabotage?\" resident Melissa Knight asked. \"Where'd that information come from? We're not getting any forthcoming information.\"\nKnight said that \"the entire bedroom (smelled) like chlorine\" after flushing the toilet in her house last weekend. She also asked about the process of testing the chlorine levels.\nGeorge Smith, president of Susquehanna Operational Services, said his team tested multiple locations when notified by the town of the complaints. Smith and a Susquehanna employee confirmed there were readings of 2.2, 0.6 and 0.54 milligrams per liter. The Environmental Protection Agency's standard is that anything above the 4.0 milligram per liter mark is not healthy to drink and could pose long-term health effects such as eye irritation and stomach problems.\nSmith declined to comment on the investigation since it's active. Spencer also declined.\n\"There's a lot that we'd all like to say,\" Spencer said. \"But since there is an investigation ongoing, when that is concluded, then we will try to give you as much information as we possibly can.\"\nThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the investigation for this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sentiment was directed toward board members and attendees alike.Although the nearly four-and-a-half-hour meeting was certainly shorter than last month's nearly eight-hour-long meeting, tension between the board and community members was felt immediately.\nWithin the first 35 minutes of the meeting, Board President Donald Patton explained the rules of public comments and called attendees \"guests\" while doing so.\n\"Let me take a few minutes to remind our guests that you are our guests,\" he said. \"We have a session coming up called Opportunity for Public Comment if you've registered, and I will read the guidelines for correct participation. But as a guest, you cannot be disrespectful to the process.\"\nThe audience and community members didn't take being labeled as guests lightly.\n\"It was stated in the past that we are guests. We are not guests. This is a public body, this is a public meeting. You are elected officials. These are not guests. These are the bosses,\" said Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton (D-Newark) as the audience applauded her. \"We have a First Amendment right to speak in public meetings, speak our minds. You can put policies in place that say you can't say certain things, but you can't police how we speak because you don't like it.\"\nWithin the last year, boards of education from Delmar to Brandywine have been subject to controversy, particularly around their most important duty: hiring, working with and overseeing a district's superintendent.\nNone have been more volatile than Christina, which voted last month to remove its superintendent after a meeting stretched more than seven hours into the middle of the night. Controversy in the Newark-area district has become so frequent that state legislators mandated that a Delaware Department of Justice attorney attend all meetings for the next year.\nSchools' governing authorityIssues occurring within boards are unusual, said Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs, the executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association. It's more typical to see tension when a board deals with issues like budgets, boundary changes or closing schools.\n\"With 90,000 school board members on 15,000 school boards across the country, by far, most are doing good work, and they're focused overall, on the vision for the school district,\" McCotter-Jacobs said.\nA local school board essentially is the governing authority for a school district, said Paolo DeMaria, the president and CEO of the National Association of State Boards of Education. School boards can fulfill tasks like hiring a superintendent and approving budgets and curriculum priorities.\nBoard members aren't paid, but some receive reimbursements for incurred expenses.\nMcCotter-Jacobs also compared board members to members of Congress, as they typically don't have term limits. Board members are typically elected for four-year periods and can run for reelection as many times as they'd like, but some do have term limits.\nState school boards are similar to overseers for local school boards, in the sense that they have regulations that local school boards have to follow, McCotter-Jacobs said. The state school board isn't involved in how a local board carries out its regulations unless they receive a complaint or an appeal that they'll review.\nHow do Delaware's local school boards work?While independent, each Delaware school board has many of the same basic characteristics: members don't receive a stipend or salary, they have no term limits and the state school board sets regulations that might influence how the local school board decision-making.\nSchool board members must be Delaware residents and U.S. citizens, be 18 or older and must live in the nominating district, said David Tull, the executive director of the Delaware School Boards Association. An individual cannot be a paid employee of the district and must never have been convicted of embezzlement.\nAfter being elected to a school board, members have two state training sessions that they're required to complete within their first year. One session is for financial training and the other is due process training, which is for dealing with special education, Tull said.\nThe Delaware School Boards Association also offers its own boot camp for board members every July, covering a variety of topics like financial training, due process training, board member responsibilities and the need to follow Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules, among other topics.\nOther organizations like First State Educate, a nonprofit that aims to engage families and communities on education issues, share information about student outcomes and encourage school board candidates, also work to provide different resources and training sessions for board members.\n\"We're trying to train the public and the community and potential school board members, and then we're trying to train the board members themselves,\" said Julia Keleher, the executive director of First State Educate. \"Ultimately, if both people have the same knowledge and information, they're going to be able to operate much more effectively.\"\nThe organization recently announced its Center for School Board Excellence in Governance, to provide school board members with resources to \"lead with confidence and integrity.\" Their first set of courses will focus on parliamentary procedures, ethical decision-making and financial management.\nFirst State Educate is also pushing out information to help people understand what boards of education are supposed to do, and will recruit people for board elections starting in January, Keleher said.\nThe organization also has a school board consultant in New Castle County and is aiming to hire additional people to develop the same role downstate.\n\"We want to develop those roles and put that resource there so that those communities also have exactly what we built in New Castle County,\" Keleher said.\nDelawareCAN, an advocacy group that works on public education improvement and equity, partners with First State Educate to run trainings and to help get qualified people interested in running for school boards, said Executive Director Britney Mumford.\nChristina board tensions cause divideThe Christina School District's Board of Education has seen a tumultuous few weeks, with some public commenters labeling the board as \"an embarrassment.\" Tuesday's meeting did little to ease lingering tension.\nThe board's discussion information items in its Aug. 13 agenda included a \"referral to the Public Integrity Commission for an opinion on whether targeting of the superintendent by the board violates public trust and reflects unfavorably on the district,\" a second referral to the Public Integrity Commission for an opinion on whether engaged in self-dealing with the district \"through alternative entities,\" and a third referral on whether a board member's prolonged absence from the district undermines the public's trust.\nOther points included nullifying the July 2024 board officer votes and holding a new vote on board officers, reinstating Superintendent Dan Shelton — who was placed on administrative leave during the July 9 meeting — as \"the latest investigation uncovered no wrongdoing,\" and recommendations for an interim superintendent, among other items.\nHowever, a simple majority of board members voted to strike discussion on all items except naming an interim superintendent.\nIt later selected former Christina and Red Clay Consolidated School District Superintendent Robert Andrzejewski to head the district this coming school year — despite questions over whether he even knew he was being nominated.\nFive members of the state legislature who represent the Christina district — Reps. Madinah Wilson-Anton (D-Newark), Paul Baumbach (D-Newark), Cyndie Romer (D-Newark), Sophie Philips (D-Bear) and Eric Morrison (D-Glasgow) — also filed a FOIA violation against the board with the Department of Justice.\n\"As legislators, we generally try to stand back and let [the board] do their stuff, but when things have a problem, we start looking into it,\" Baumbach said. \"The closer you look into it, you realize how bad that the district board is being led.\"\nFOIA violations\nIn June, the DOJ found the board violated FOIA laws by holding an unannounced executive session for an improper purpose and failing to provide adequate notice in its March and May meeting agendas for votes regarding the contract rescission and vote of no-confidence in Shelton.\nIf a meeting is not noticed properly, meaning there will be items considered that were not on the agenda, then the public wouldn't know whether they need to attend the meeting or for how long they'd need to attend, said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who studies government transparency.\nFenster added that sometimes an agency might use vague wording in a public agenda because they may not know exactly what they're doing with the issue or what to anticipate, but know they will cover it.\n\"Members of the public are not being paid for going to these meetings, having other things to do and busy lives,\" Fenster said. \"If this is a trap or a trick that the agency is playing, this seems both kind of duplicitous and shady, as well as potentially illegal, because it's not really following along.\"\nThe DOJ is required to send a report to the General Assembly after its year-long observation. The report will include any FOIA matters observed and recommendations it has for necessary changes to ensure the \"proper operation\" of the board.\nPatton declined Spotlight Delaware's request for comment on the controversy, citing the \"potential for litigation.\"\nPatton made it a point to apologize to the public during the Aug. 13 meeting for \"a number of things,\" admitting the board should be functioning differently. Patton also said he's been working with a parliamentarian to help provide a stricter structure on Robert's Rules of Order to help streamline the meetings.\nPatton also acknowledged the FOIA violation complaints and said the board will be having a lawyer speak to them about the open records laws and violations.\n\"You have to remember when boards are put in place, folks aren't trained on these specific things,\" Patton said.\nAlthough Christina has been a longtime member of the Delaware School Boards Association, they decided to drop out this past year, said Tull, the DSBA executive director, who added that Christina's newest board member paid to attend DSBA's boot camp though.\nAlthough there's been a bit more public awareness in Christina, Mumford, of DelawareCAN, hasn't seen the average parent in the district become more interested in the board.\n\"There has been some of it, but it's really been to the extent of, 'Why are they acting crazy and not actually focusing on policies that affect my students?'\" she explained.\nMumford added that the public's perception of the board \"acting crazy\" might cause families to see board members as something separate from the community.\n\"When things like this happen, people get the perception that, 'Oh, these are just another group of power-hungry policymakers that don't care about my family and my students,'\" she said.\nBrandywine also faces FOIA accusations\nThe Brandywine School District's board faced its own FOIA allegation this spring, following the district's former superintendent's retirement. One month after former Brandywine Superintendent Lincoln Hohler announced his retirement, then-Board President John Skrobot announced that then-Deputy Superintendent Lisa Lawson would be replacing Hohler.\nSkrobot then asked board members Jason Heller and Kim Stock to volunteer for a small working group to deliver contract proposals to the full board.\nThe request caused a debate over whether the board was violating FOIA guidelines as the working group discussion wasn't on the agenda. During the meeting, board member the Rev. Shawn Jegede called on the public to file FOIA violations against the board if they felt the board went against open record laws.\n\"I have tried over and over again to encourage this board to no longer continue these violations of FOIA so that we can focus our attention on educating our students and supporting our staff and not wasting our time on lawsuits,\" Jegede said during the meeting.\nThe board moved to executive session to consult legal counsel and when they returned, Skrobot made the volunteer request again and clarified that the working group discussions would happen in a public meeting.\nCurrent Board President Ralph Ackerman said there was no open records violation. Their attorney instructed that the subcommittee could be made of three board members or less.\n\"It's when you reach four and you have a quorum that that becomes unacceptable, so I think it was misunderstood by the person who had chatted with the attorney as to what was acceptable and what was not,\" Ackerman said. \"It is certainly acceptable for the president to ask a couple of board members if they would volunteer to help negotiate a contract, which I believe, is exactly what Mr. Skrobot did at the time.\"\nBrandywine's board of education doesn't have an attorney at every meeting, it instead uses a \"strictly representative model,\" Ackerman said. He also noted that almost all of the board members have gone to the DSBA's boot camp in recent years.\nCapital super leaves after 'hostility'\nWhen former Superintendent Vilicia Cade announced her departure from the Capital School District on June 11, she thanked the Board of Education for the opportunity to serve the district and highlighted some of her achievements.\nOn June 12, the district published a joint letter between Cade and Board President Felecia Duggins, showing gratitude from both parties. Duggins thanked Cade for her service to the school and Cade expressed that \"under the esteemed Board of Education the district will remain the heartbeat of the first state.\"\nHowever, in her resignation letter to staff, Cade cited a hostile work environment and interference in her ability to carry out her role.\n\"I have consistently asked for us to work on fostering trust, mutual respect and jointly explore ways to work more intently toward improving communication between the board and superintendent,\" Cade wrote. \"Subsequently, my request was met with aggressive hostility on the part of some board members, including acts of intimidation and intentional misuse of authority.\"\nBoth Cade and Duggins did not respond to Spotlight Delaware's request for comment.\nThe public's perception of their school board could make it more difficult to find candidates in the future, Mumford added.\n\"The folks that run for school board are not generally people that see that as a political steppingstone. In my opinion, they are people that really want to invest their time in the district, that really care about student outcomes, and when things become so polarized, it becomes difficult for them,\" Mumford said. \"Situations like this make it tougher to find good candidates moving forward because they don't see the school board as creating positive outcomes, as looking to really make a true impact. They just see it as this polarizing political entity.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But that's the goal.\"\nAs is pushing for another regional title and state championship, where Queen Anne's fell to Glenelg in last year's Class 2A state final.\nWhile Fitzgerald works to position the Lions for their title runs, Abby Burke takes over a Saints Peter and Paul program that is bidding for a fifth consecutive Eastern Shore Independent Athletic Conference championship.\n\"I've been told that,\" said Burke, whose team extended its ESIAC winning streak to 28 games with Monday's 13-7 victory over Salisbury School. \"No pressure [laughing]. Great.\"\nThe Lions and Sabres each lost key pieces from last year's successful campaigns, but return enough talent to again challenge for their respective championships.\nQueen Anne's could get a serious challenge from an improved Easton team and county neighbor Kent Island, while a tough early schedule could make North Caroline a tough draw come the postseason.\nThe conference gains another member this year, as North Dorchester begins its first year of varsity play under head coach Kyle Riggin, the longtime Dorchester Youth Lacrosse coach and 1993 Cambridge-South Dorchester graduate who played crease defense under the late Phil Johnson.\nHere's a look at this year's teams:\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Marissa Harding.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Jamya Bryan (Jr.); Defense: Sydney Marshall (Jr.); Eileen Thibeault (So.); Madison Jackson (So.); Olivia Shifler (Fr.); Midfield: Katie Wheatley (So.); Gaby Higdon (So.); Madalyn Spicer (Jr.); Attack: Christina Hyde (Sr.); Izzy Trissell (So.); Faith Lyles (So.); Ayren Jones (So.).\nOutlook: Harding has been encouraged by what she's seen in the preseason, which included a pair of scrimmage victories.\n\"We lost eight seniors last year, but the girls have done a really great job of stepping up and trying to fill some of those positions,\" Harding said. \"We have a lot of new girls so just helping each other learn the skills of lacrosse and just working together, and just being really patient with each other has been good to see.\"\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Katie Lowman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Zelia Proa (So.); Defense: Anna Quidley (Sr.); Grier Kegan (Jr.); Stella Kabler (Jr.); Hannah Dahlen (So.); Abby Jobeck (So.); Midfield: Samantha Murphy (Sr.); Addie Knox (So.); Lily Tiebosch (Fr.); Taylor Bowen (Fr.); Attack: Myka Motovidlak (Sr.); Dakota Lhotsky (Jr.); Anna Crist (Jr.); Miranda Stup (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Warriors could be the Bayside's most improved team. Eleven returning starters and Murphy's transfer in from Sts. Peter & Paul already had Easton within two victories of last year's win total (six) heading Tuesday's clash with Queen Anne's.\n\"We have a pretty deep bench and that is really helpful,\" Lowman said. \"I think we're playing as a team and not as individuals. We have a lot of talent and experience, and we're young. We only have three seniors. If they play at their very best I think there isn't anything they can't do.\"\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Kaitlin Paukovits.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Ava Mason (Sr.); Bri Legg (Jr.); Defense: Rylie Corn (Sr.); Lilliana Mellinger (Jr.); Madison Jordan (Sr.); Alice Phelan (So.); Rita Yost (Jr.); Midfield: Cara Steele (So.); Hailey Offutt (Fr.); Grace Mathews (Fr.); Attack: Ellie Burnside (Sr.); Willow Yost (Jr.); Parker Tengwall (So.); Gabby Polk (Sr.); Caroline Levin (Sr.).\nOutlook: The Bucs scored in double digits in all three of their scrimmages, and have hit double digits in two of their first three regular-season games.\n\"Definitely have a lot more offensive threats this year than previously, Paukovits said. \"Some of our new freshmen have come in and are mixing things up a little bit for us. So it's been awesome.\"\nThrough the first three games, Steele, a sophomore, has netted a team-high six goals and six assists, followed by classmate Tengwall (4-6) and freshmen Offutt and Mathews, with five goals and two assists apiece.\n\"We're always hoping to get to that Bayside championship,\" Paukovits said. \"That's the goal.\"\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: Mandie Shockley.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Morgan McHenry (Fr.); Emily Seehafer (Sr.); Defense: Amber Baiers (Jr.); Kylie Ogden (Jr.); Irma Sanchez (Jr.); Mackenzie Cahall (Jr.); Sarah Brown (Sr.); Jordyn Roberts (Sr.); Midfield: Ashlynn Bisesi (So.); Reece Bisesi (Jr.); Maddie McNinch (Jr.); Hadley Sullivan (Fr.); Paisley Garland (Jr.); Attack: Ashley Kercheval (Sr.); Gracie Faulkner (Jr.); Maddie Nicholson (Jr.); Claire Jones (So.); Jamie Robey (Fr.).\nOutlook: The Bulldogs graduated five off last year's team, including Riley Walstrum (Ashland University), leading scorer Claire Blue (Lindenwood University) and goalie Ashleigh Lawry (Wilmington University).\nBut Shockley doesn't see this season as a rebuild.\nThe Bisesi sisters have stepped up to fill the scoring hole created by Blue's loss. McNinch and Garland continue to progress nicely, and McHenry, who has travel experience, could be a mainstay between the pipes the next four years.\n\"We have a solid base and the girls are filling in roles,\" Shockley said.\nNORTH DORCHESTER\nHead Coach: Kyle Riggin.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Maddie Tobat (Sr.); Defense: Amanda Perez (So.); Jaisia Friend (Sr.); Jackie Gravenor (Jr.); Ashley Baiers (So.); Midfield: Jules Tobat (Sr.); Adi Thomas (So.); Shelby Seese (So.); Attack: Katie Bell (Fr.); Payton Turner (Fr.); Kendall Harrington (So.); Ella Era (Fr.); Attack: Taylor Larimer (So.); Rylee Christopher (So.); Isabella Ramos-Curtis (Fr.); Tyjiah Carter (Jr.).\nOutlook: Riggin said the first day a practice he had four players come out who had never touched a lacrosse stick.\n\"Just a lot of teaching fundamentals and basics,\" Riggin said of his team, which afte rlosing to defending South Bayside champion Decatur in its first game rebounded with a shutout of Wicomico.\nBut Riggin emphasized that while wins may be few, this season is about establishing a foundation and positive environment that will leave players wanting to come back.\nQUEEN ANNE'S\nHead Coach: Kesley Fitzgerald.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Emma Dulin (Sr.); Defense: Bea Holthaus (So.); Taylor Brown (So.); Kariana Hickson (So.); Tivi Blue (Jr.); Beau Dulin (So.); Midfield: RJ Ensor (Sr.); Riley Klepper (Sr.); Haley Cole (Jr.); Jordan Bilbo (Jr.); Attack: Kaitlyn Horney (Sr.); Charlotte Schmidt (So.); Kaisa Hickson (Sr.): Mel Gill (Fr.); Elle Wick (Fr.).\nOutlook: The Lions lost big pieces from last year's 15-3 team, including Baillie Pinder (Florida Southern), Emily Keppler (Shenandoah) and goalie Maddie George (Delaware).\nBut expectations haven't dipped in Centreville.\n\"No matter what we're starting out with, there's always going to be the expectation that we keep the success and the standards that we have each year,\" said Fitzgerald, whose team has won two of its first three games, the lone loss, a one-goal heartbreaker to defending Delaware state champion Cape Henlopen.\nFitzgerald thinks these Lions have more scoring options than they've had in a long time. What may impress the coach even more is her team's lacrosse IQ.\n\"We have a very smart offense,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Their on-ball, off-ball awareness is really strong. We've got a great goalie between the pipes, and in between there we've got girls that know what it means to have those high-pressure games. People like RJ and Riley they know how to put the ball in the net and do what needs to be done on the field.\"\nGUNSTON\nHead Coach: Brian Aiken.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Brinley Leech (Fr.); Emma Serravinals (So.); Defense: Genevieve Baughman (Jr.); Emily Steele (Jr.); Olivia Blusk (So.); Brynn Roberts (So.); Midfield: Grace Shepherd (Sr.); Elena Szwaja (So.); Isabel Gerstmyer (Fr.); Attack: Layla Kent (Jr.); Emma Walker (So.); Kate Zottarelli (So.); Emma Morris (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Herons' roster has doubled in size from a year ago. Despite those numbers, and the return of Kent and Shepherd — two of the ESIAC's better all-around athletes — Aiken's focus is on one critical component.\n\"I have expectations that we're going to be successful as long as we can win the draw,\" Aiken said. \"If we can keep possession I think we'll be OK. Because offensively I think Layla Kent is one of best players in the league. She's a competitor.\"\nSAINTS PETER & PAUL\nHead Coach: Abby Burke.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Kylie Kroniser (Jr.); Defense: Regan Wolters (Fr.); Annie Albright (Jr.); Ashley Handy (So.); Bridget Gillman (Jr.); Claire Bieber (Sr.); Midfield: Avery McCall (Jr.); Kat Murphy (Sr.); Kendall Kroniser (Sr.); Julia Spero (So.); Caroline Corson (8th); Attack: Mary Callahan (Fr.); Kate Sweeney (So.); Eryn Callahan (Jr.); Sadie Jacobs (Fr.); Emma Hainey (Jr.).\nOutlook: Burke takes over for Alison Beyer, who guided the Sabres to one of their most successful stretches in program history, winning four straight ESIAC titles.\nThe South Atlantic Conference MVP as a midfielder at Wingate University, Burke doesn't see any reason for expectations to sag, and thinks a stiff early season schedule will enhance the Sabres' hopes for extending their title string\n\"I'm very excited for this year,\" said Burke, who coached the SSPP's middle school team last year, and has also coached the M&D Shore travel team. \"We've added schools they've never played before from the other side of the bridge just to add better competition. And even though we might not have won those games, the girls always fought until the last whistle and never made it easy for a team when they did lose.\"\nEditor's Note: Information on Kent County was unavailable at presstime. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A clown named Crickett 'stands out' at Port Deposit festival\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1049\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PORT DEPOSIT — Hundreds of people attended the fourth annual Pirate Takeover in Port Deposit last weekend, but one person stood out in the crowd — quite literally.Head and shoulders above all the rest was \"Crickett,\" a professional clown who ambled throughout the Marina Park grounds on stilts that were hidden by his tuxedo-style pants and boosted his natural six-foot height to somewhere around eight feet.\n\"Crickett,\" whose real name is James McGrath, turned heads — upward, as well as sideways — wherever he roamed Saturday during the seven-hour event.\nMany people stopped in their tracks and tilted their heads skyward to confirm that there was, indeed, a face attached to the top of that human mountain in their midst. Clearly amazed, giggling kids ran up to Crickett to get a closer look. Several of the youngsters went airborne, giving it their best Jordan jump, as they high-fived with this spectacle that bent forward accommodatingly.\n\"Some people actually get startled when they see me,\" McGrath said. \"You get the usual jokes from people, too, like, 'How's the weather up there?' and, 'Hey, Shorty,'\" stuff like that.\nOf course, folks ask him how tall he is on those stilts. And they ask if he has ever fallen.\nThe answer to that last question: Only once in approximately 20 years of practicing and performing on stilts. And after that tumble, Crickett got back on his feet — unscathed — because learning how to fall safely on stilts is as important as learning how to walk on stilts.\nThe trick is to never extend your arms to break your fall because, instead, you will break your wrists, humerus and other nearby bones, he emphasized. Tucking your extremities, balling up your body and rolling when you hit the ground are the ingredients for a safe fall.\nAs it turns out, Crickett takes his clowning very seriously. A 44-year-old Washington, D.C. resident, McGrath performs as Crickett in the region about 100 times a year under his enterprises of Shows by Crickett, Block Party Bubbles and Clown Cabaret.\n\"I performed at the Pirate Takeover event in Port Deposit for the past few years, and it is easily one of my favorite gigs,\" McGrath commented.\nThose 100 or so annual gigs are the sole source of income for McGrath, who married for the first time in 2024 after spending many years on the road as a professional clown, including a long stint with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\nThat clowning job with The Greatest Show on Earth took him to every state in the continental United States, save for Wyoming, the Dakotas and perhaps one or two others. McGrath performed as \"Crickett\" with Ringling Brothers in some major arenas, including the legendary Madison Square Garden.\n\"Back stage, there was a bunch of pictures of Billy Joel because he had performed there so many times. I think he holds the record,\" McGrath said of that famous New York City venue.\nSo how did McGrath morph into a professional clown?\nBorn in Massachusetts and raised in Virginia, McGrath went to the circus with his family as a kid and was drawn to all of its attractions, particularly juggling. While attending Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., where he graduated in 2005 with a psychology degree, McGrath learned to juggle.\n\"I always liked juggling as a hobby. I got a book, something like, 'The Complete Klutz Guide to Juggling' and taught myself how to juggle,\" he recalled.\nPerhaps the main lesson that McGrath learned while majoring in psychology was this: Live an adventurous life and see new places while you are still young and able.\nAfter attending a clowning camp in New York City, a few years post graduation, McGrath joined the Big Apple Circus as a concessions worker — just to get his big, goofy clown foot in the door.\nAs did many of the 150 other circus employees, McGrath lived in a renovated room in the back of a trailer while the show traveled to places in Georgia, Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia and New York.\n\"I was a cotton candy twister,\" he said, before explaining, \"I was just hoping to meet some people, make the right connections.\"\nThat pay-your-dues gig made a huge difference, too, because McGrath then got a performance job with Ringling Brothers. He performed under the Big Top as Crickett with the Blue Unit of that outfit from 2006 through 2011, juggling and executing all manners of jokes, including sight gags.\n\"I was very lucky. I just happened to be submitting a resume at the time when one of the clowns jumped ship — so I was available and got the job,\" McGrath remembered.\nIt was common for Ringling Brothers to stay in the cities and towns on the tour and perform nine to 15 shows per week, before moving on to the next stop. It was a demanding way of life that was tempered by the fun and adventure it provided.\n\"We traveled by train and pretty much lived on that train. We each had a 6'-by-6' room. We were paid a salary that was just enough to live on, just enough to meet expenses. We got one month off every two years,\" McGrath reviewed.\nIt was a passion project. \"I'd work with the other clowns and we'd come up with our own gags. We'd also work with writers and a team of prop builders,\" McGrath said.\nThere was no need, however, for McGrath's talent on two-foot stilts at the Ringling Brothers level. \"They had Caribbean stilt-walkers who walked smoothly on 6-foot stilts,\" McGrath noted.\nThe secret to walking on stilts, according to McGrath: \"You have to get over your reptilian mindset and feel comfortable walking higher above ground than normal. And you have to know how to fall safely. It took me about 20 hours total of walking on stilts before it felt natural to me.\"\nHe added, \"Most gigs are one to two hours long. Some, though, are four to five hours long and you feel pretty achy after walking on stilts all that time.\"\nAfter he left Ringling Brothers and transitioned into a more domesticated life that still allowed him to clown and perform regionally, McGrath incorporated more stilts-walking into his act. He has been performing solo as Crickett, mostly on weekends, for approximately the past 15 years.\n\"It is an abnormal job, but I have a pretty normal life,\" he summarized. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Perry White's sister (veteran character actress Mabel Albertson) vanish while investigating a voodoo cult in Haiti, sending Perry (John Hamilton) and Clark Kent (George Reeves) on a quest to find them.\"Freaky Friday\" (Freeform, Monday, Sept. 11): Filmed a couple of times previously and again since, this fanciful body-switch comedy has served the Disney studio well, including in this 2003 version. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are quite enjoyable as the mother and daughter who magically make the exchange, a therapist and a would-be musician who each get a new and quite deep understanding of the other by walking in their shoes, quite literally. Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray also appear.\"Magnum, p.i.\" (getTV, Monday, Sept. 11): \"Limbo\" is an appropriate title for the episode that concluded Season 7 of the series, since it originally was intended to end the entire show but CBS ended up renewing it for one more round. A seriously wounded Magnum (Tom Selleck) is in a coma, and his ghostly self pays visits to his friends to consider the times he's had with each. Elements of the story continued to play out over the first couple of episodes of Season 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is very interesting to consider what people seem most passionate about.Everyone seems to be passionate about something.\nAs Christians, we are passionate about many things — God, family, rights, the list can go on and on. But how many of us Christians (followers of Christ) are passionate about Jesus' last words before ascending to Heaven?\nMark 16:15 — And He said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\"\nThere are so many Christians today passionate about politics, conspiracies, health, theology, but not many are passionate about Christ's last words.\nWe need to on guard so that we do not become better at winning arguments, than at winning souls. God have mercy on us and forgive us of this great neglect. Give us ears to hear and hearts to receive and obey your word to us.\n2 Timothy 4:2. — Preach the Gospel in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. Help us Lord to remember that the last words of our Lord Jesus Christ are called the Great Commission, and not the Great Option.\nLord strengthen us to do your will.

They began distributing the groceries just after 11 a.m., though cars were lined up hours in advance.\nAaron's Place Executive Director Cheryl Beulah said volunteers handed out food until around 7 p.m. Around 1,115 families were served, according to Beulah.\nFrom seeing residents come into the food pantry every week, Beulah says \"food insecurity is real.\" Mary Lou Russ, an administrative assistant at the food pantry, said the amount of need is \"overwhelming.\"\nDuring the pandemic, Beulah says they served around 2,500 people for the Thanksgiving giveaway, an all-time high. The work done by Aaron's Place, which is partnered with the statewide nonprofit Maryland Food Bank, hasn't slowed down at all since 2020.\nAccording to Maryland Hunger Solutions, more than 6,000 Caroline County residents participated in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in fiscal year 2022. 2020 census data shows 13.2% of Caroline County residents were below the poverty line, above the then-state average of 9%.\nAnd according to a new survey of holiday meal costs by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the price of a Thanksgiving dinner has risen 29% from 2020. Beulah sees those rising food prices, and says it's a \"challenging\" time.\nShe said many of the residents in need, particularly during Thanksgiving and the holidays, are families and people from Caroline County. She also sees growing concern with hunger for the senior community.\nBeulah said while discussions pertaining to food insecurity are important, action matters. In part, that's what drives her to lead the Denton food pantry and soup kitchen.\n\"That conversation's not putting food on that person's table,\" Beulah said. \" … Your neighbors could be starving.\"\nAaron's Place's food pantry is open Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Wednesdays from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and the third Thursday at 11 a.m. in January, March, May, July, September and November. The soup kitchen opens on Tuesdays at Noon. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will be evaluated as the investigation goes forward and council is able to talk and decide what they want to do.\"\nGreensboro will still be uploading the meeting minutes for residents to check and see what was discussed, the town said.\n\"They can always get a copy of the of the meeting minutes. There's certainly, there are plenty of people that attend that put the content out on social media,\" Kelledes said.\nThe town of Greensboro's plan is to have another form of video up after the investigation has been conducted and they receive recommendations on what software is good to use to conduct meetings without interruption.\n\"We're just trying to get through the investigation and see what the FBI tells us and what they recommend,\" Kelledes said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 5.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 18.2 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 1.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.73 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.05 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.24 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1 cent per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.41 per gallon today. The national average is down 18.0 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 13.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 17, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.55 per gallon)June 17, 2022: $4.97 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.99 per gallon)June 17, 2021: $2.98 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.07 per gallon)June 17, 2020: $2.12 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.11 per gallon)June 17, 2019: $2.61 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)June 17, 2018: $2.85 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.89 per gallon)June 17, 2017: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)June 17, 2016: $2.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.35 per gallon)June 17, 2015: $2.77 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.80 per gallon)June 17, 2014: $3.65per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.61 per gallon, up 10.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.51 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.56 per gallon, down 12.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.68 per gallon.Hagerstown: 3.36 per gallon, down 8.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.45 per gallon.\n\"Since the national average price of gasoline fell to its lowest June level since 2021 last week, we've seen the drop in prices take a break, with some states seeing a small rise over the last week. Thankfully, I expect this to be more like a short timeout, with an eventual return to falling gasoline prices in most states,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"The decline in diesel prices continues, with the national average price of diesel now at its lowest level since January 2022. Both gasoline and diesel prices remain below their year-ago level, which is music to the ears of the Federal Reserve, as fuel prices are a significant component of the Consumer Price Index. Also factoring in gasoline demand that has been running a bit weaker than expected, market fundamentals look pretty good right now if you're a motorist.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With the assistance of Allison Brown, Toys For Tots Foundation Youth Ambassador, Lee read her book to the kids.\n\"This is my second Night Owl book,\" Lee said, adding her son Jourdan is her inspiration to the stories.\n\"My son does not like to go to sleep at night,\" she said of Jourdan Russell, now 11. Even though it was written for him at a younger age, Lee said Jourdan still claims the title. \"I am the Night Owl,' she said Jourdan would say.\nAs the story developed, the youngsters peppered Lee with comments and questions, showing they knew about the planets, their names and unique qualities. To her right, Brown kept up, turning the pages so each of the colorful pages could be seen.\nBrown, who is from Centreville and now lives in Baltimore, has been a Toys For Tots Youth Ambassador for three years. She got involved through her American Heritage Girls troop. The lessons she's learned so far have been invaluable.\n\"I've really learned how to do social media ... how to push a post to get the community involved,\" Brown said. She's also learned about all the services in her own community and can talk to other teens about how they can get involved or get help.\nValerie Anderson, representing the regional foundation, said Brown — like the 44 other youth ambassadors across the country — is \"a stand out person.\"\n\"She's been to our Outdoor Odyssey Leadership Camp in Pennsylvania, she goes to monthly meetings and activities and helps us raise brand awareness,\" Anderson said.\nLee gave each child her book and Brown handed each a Toys For Tots backpack that included such items as bookmarks, rulers, slap bracelets and stress balls.\nThe Night Owl Goes to Space is available on Amazon in hardback and paperback editions. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We celebrate not only their accomplishments but also the bright futures that each of them is carving out in our community,\" she said.\n\"META is a six month intensive business development and coaching program aimed at providing a cohort of small minority businesses with the resources they need to scale,\" said Sam Shoge, cofounder and partner of Rivers and Roads Consulting, who served as program facilitator and coach.\nThe program intends to close the knowledge resource and funding gap between minority-owned and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nData is applied across all minority businesses including women-owned and veteran-owned, he said, and the importance of the program is noted in the disparities between minority and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nThe average revenue of black sole proprietorships versus non-minority sole proprietorships is $22,000 versus $50,000 respectively, according to Shoge.\nOn average non-minority owned businesses are six times larger than black-owned businesses, he said.\nA total of 15 applications from women and minority owned businesses were received in 2023 and five Queen Anne's County businesses were selected to participate in the inaugural program, he said.\nParticipants included Moniesha Baynard, owner of Three Guys and a Girl Personal Chef and Catering; Diane Moorman-White, owner of DMW Soul Fitness; Timeka Wheeler, owner of Long Live Assisted Living; Deayna Ewell, owner of Onyx Beauty Supply Salon Barbershop; and Ebony Johnson, owner of Tips and Toes Nail Studio.\nThe six-month program at the Kent Island Library began its first seminar in February 2024 and concluded in August.\nMETA entailed monthly business development seminars including a variety of topics such as market strategy, business planning, sales and customer service, bookkeeping best practices, licensing and regulation as well as personal coaching, Shoge said.\nA key aspect of the program was how entrepreneurs can partner and collaborate and support fellow community small businesses, he said.\n\"Our secretary of commerce Secretary (Micheal) Gill always said that economic development is a team sport and that is very much reflected in this program here,\" Shoge said.\nOfficials were very happy with the outcome and success of the program, with many participants reporting increased revenues, Shoge said.\nTransitioning from a 36-year veterinary career, participant Moorman-White, credited the program with giving her the push and the confidence to prove to herself she could turn her \"side-gig\" into a full time career.\n\"Probably the biggest thing the META program has done for me was it changed my mindset. I am now recognizing the power I possess to achieve my goals both big and small,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dogs ruled on Sunday October 8, when over 50 were blessed at Christ Church.They strained at their leashes, sniffed around and got in line with their owners to see Rector Steve Mosher, who dressed in a white robe for outside ceremony.A reading from Genesis made God's creative powers known.Mosher read, \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky God blessed them and said 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on Earth.'\" He continued to read that God created the creeping things and saw that it was good.There was a reading from Andrew Carter that mentioned a menagerie of animals.

He pleaded guilty in February to six counts of promoting and distributing child pornography. During the plea hearing, Braun said he pleaded guilty because he was guilty and it was in his best interest.\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan handed down a five-year sentence with all but one year, five months and 29 days suspended. That nearly 18-month term began June 26.\nBraun was previously charged on 34 total counts — 17 for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 for possessing child pornography. As part of the six-count plea agreement, the state did not prosecute the remaining 28 charges.\nAt the February plea hearing, prosecutors said the Easton Police Department received a tip last year from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children about a person possessing child sexual abuse material. Investigators identified that person as Braun, prosecutors said.\nBraun will be registered as a tier II sex offender. He is under five years supervised probation among a number of other conditions. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Federalsburg officials address town's mounting issues at public forum\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — The Federalsburg Town Council hosted hundreds of residents for a public forum at Federalsburg Elementary School Monday evening.Town officials wanted to set the record straight about town rumors, addressing issues like misappropriation of town funds, employee resignations, $5 million of debt, wastewater treatment issues and police department cost.\nA 50-minute explanation by the council members explained the root of these issues and the options and plans to solve them.\nDebt and staff accountability\nCouncil members revealed the town's $5 million of debt dates back to 1995.\n\"We did not get into a over $5 million debt overnight, but here we are and we're trying to clean it up piece by piece,\" council member Brandy James said. \"When I came on council, the math just didn't add up. So, looking into things, some of this debt goes back to 1995.\n\"The town has had a very historic past of one not paying bills on time, two robbing Peter to pay Paul, and three in order to get anything done instead of doing the right thing and figuring out how to better utilize the funds that were coming in, they would just take out loans or they would take out grants. Some grants were grants that the town wasn't even qualified for, but that's what they would do.\"\nJames said the town must pay back grants to grant providers because the grant providers have discovered that the town wasn't eligible to receive the grants. She said the town has lost grants because of not having audits done since fiscal year 2023.\nFederalsburg officials plan to establish a plan to pay off debt within 12 months using money from the town's general fund. The town has frozen spending and committed to a hiring freeze, except for a part-time code enforcement officer.\nAfter the hiring freeze, James said that the town will shift its employment focus to hiring staff who are qualified for their positions, no longer hiring employees based off relationships.\nWastewater and water issues\nCouncil member Darlene Hammond led the discussion on the fire department water usage. She said the town will not charge the fire department for water used to fight fires, but the fire house will be metered for non-emergency uses, which it previously has not been.\nThe town will install meters on hydrants to help track and detect leaks and start billing churches and other town serving companies for water and sewer usage.\nTown officials acknowledged past issues with inconsistent billing and old meters. They plan to take steps to clear billing statements and update account balances. They will explore tools for online payments and text alerts when bills are due.\nThe town's wastewater treatment plant was also discussed at the meeting. The facility was built to support a housing development in the town that was never constructed, making it outsized to the town's needs.\nMayor Kim Abner said the facility is built to handle 750,000 gallons a day, more than double the current usage of 350,000 gallons per day.\nThe town has many issues with taking care of the facility due to cost and improper usage.\n\"It costs a lot of money to fix the water main. It costs a lot of money to maintain the wastewater treatment plant,\" Abner said. \"There are state mandates that we have to deal with. We also need a new sludge press because the sludge press presses the water out, and if you don't press all the water out, you're paying more at the landfill. So, the wastewater treatment plant's a lot. It's a big investment. It's a lot of money, but we have to do it for safe drinking water and safe toilets.\"\nPolice Department\nCouncil member Ian Ferguson talked about the cost of the town's police department.\nIf the town were to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to provide policing services, it would save the town between $300,000 and $500,000, he said.\nThe town currently pays $1.146 million for the Federalsburg Police Department.\nSheriff Donald Baker told residents that the his would hire Federalsburg's police officers if it were to assume policing duties for the town.\nAccording to the Town Council, the current police station could be used as a substation for the Sheriff's Office if the town signs a memorandum of understanding.\nThe town plans to continue to have quarterly public meetings to keep the town informed on all issues and improvements. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Art exhibit in Easton uses small items to explore larger themes such as war, homelessness\n\n September 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 416\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A new art exhibit in Easton uses small-scale items like twigs to tell large-scale stories involving war, poverty and conflict.Inside the Academy Art Museum, \"To the Edge of Your World\" by Dutch-Irish artist Anita Groener welcomes viewers into a peaceful setting of grid-like drawings and bird-chirping sounds.\nTwo main displays — Cradle and Shrapnel — are sculpture works by Groener. They include materials like twigs gathered from walks with her dog that she started collecting more than 10 years ago.\nGroener hopes the sculptures help people understand some of \"their own baggage\" and history.\n\"Everything's very small, which creates a psychological distance,\" said Groener, who lives in Dublin, while inside the Easton exhibit space last month. \"And that's important because we witness all these world events.\"\nFor her, the exhibit is largely motivated by time she spent in the southern United States visiting civil rights monuments, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIts meaning continues to evolve today, Groener said.\n\"Like we in Ireland watch what's going on in America,\" she said. \"But it's such a distance, and I'm not taking part in that. Yet it affects us all. Everything that happens in the world, in our lives, affects us and is connected.\"\nThe Ireland-based artist doesn't want people to walk in thinking the art will yield certain takeaways. Rather, Groener hopes her art is open to interpretation.\n\"I like ambiguous readings, because as an artist, you can't be prescriptive,\" she said.\nGroener's exhibit is the Academy Art Museum's first ever international exhibit. Charlotte Potter Kasic, the museum's executive director, said it took \"many hoops to jump through\" to make happen, but she's happy it panned out.\nThe opening weekend for the exhibit and a sister documentary film last month drew more than 250 people, Kasic said. They watched \"Shelter,\" a 30-minute short film addressing homelessness on the Mid-Shore. Groener, the Talbot Interfaith Shelter and filmmaker Matt Kresling collaborated on the project.\nAt the front of Groener's exhibit is the main shelter structure, which is shown at the end of the film. She took around 10,000 pictures of the structure to make the stop-motion scene possible.\nGroener said the scene is a \"coming together of people\" and all about community. Kasic said the audience on opening weekend was captivated by the film.\n\"No one moved,\" Kasic said. \"They were all very engaged.\"\nThe film is slated to show at the Chesapeake Film Festival on Oct. 10 at the Ebenezer Theater in Easton. Groener's exhibit is open at the Academy Art Museum through Oct. 27. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Open to students across the Shore, including Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, working individually or in groups, Junior Division (grades six-eight) and Senior Division (grades nine-12) students select a topic related to an annual theme. Information on the competitive event is distributed to students by their history teachers.The 2024 NHD theme is \"Turning Points in History.\" There are five different types of projects that students complete: documentaries, exhibits, performances, and websites that can be done as a group or individually or papers that may only be done individually.Research is key, so the two teachers partnered with the public libraries in the participating Upper Shore counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, and Cecil.\"Schools have limited research options,\" said Hayman, \"so we turned to the county libraries who have more resources.\" During the fall season, as students begin picking a theme and looking for information, the teachers make themselves available at libraries across the region on specific dates so that librarians and History Day staff can provide assistance with finding research options, accessing online databases, or browsing materials.Hayman said the students learn valuable skills \"like how to analyze information, to make sure sources are reliable, and to form their own opinion.\" Last weekend, Hayman and Anders visited Queen Anne's Library on Kent Island. Next up is the Talbot County Free Library in Easton on Oct. 21 from 9 a.m. 1 p.m.; Queen Anne's County Library in Centreville from 9 a.m. 1 p.m. on Nov. 4; and the Learning Resource Center at Chesapeake College on Nov. 12 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.The actual contest is March 23, 2024, at Chesapeake College. Judges from the Upper-Shore community include teachers, professors, and museum staff. Students who place are then able to participate in the state finals on May 4 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.The hard work of Hayman and Anders has paid off. \"We saw that at the beginning the winners were always from the western shore,\" said Anders.\"Now we send more students to the state event than everyone but Baltimore County.\" Hayman said the program helps make history more real and interesting to students.\"You don't usually have students thrilled to be in history class,\" said Hayman. \"Students who participate sometimes find their true passion.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nThomas Hayman and Andy Anders, both history teachers at Centreville Middle School, visit Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island branch on their first stop helping students from the Upper Shore with their History Day project research. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I got interested in politics when I was involved with Medical Freedom for Talbot County.\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 2 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nRunning for Ward 2 is an honor. I am running because we need a voice for the day-to-day people who live in Easton. The hardworking backbone of our society. Your neighbors, servers, police, grocery store workers, those struggling on social security, etc. I see and hear the struggles.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nI will prioritize the accountability of the Town Council, transparency and accountability with \"your\" money, smart growth for our special town.\nWe need to keep our next generation. People with and without children are from moving away from the Shore because they can't afford to live here and raise a family.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThe town budget is not transparent enough. We need to see more details instead of just line items with no explanations. It's hard to see exactly where our money is going.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nIt is funny the Census has Easton population growth of only 101 more people since 2020. We all can see there has been much more growth. Either that or are we just congested because of workers commuting who live in more affordable towns.We need starter home neighborhoods for the first responders, teachers and people not making six figures. We can think outside the box — barndominiums, tiny homes or prefab housing neighborhoods, which are much less expensive to build.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nSafety is key for everyone in Easton. We need to treat our neighbors with kindness. Introduce yourself and watch out for each other. We have exceptional first responders, including police, EMS and volunteer firefighters, working a tough job just out of their heart for the people of their community. They are doing a great job even though they are running with short manpower.\nWith the area growing, we need to make sure we keep them equipped with proper needs.\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI love the Ward 2 area where I live and volunteer. The Rails to Trails is a huge part of linking neighborhoods to the downtown area. Keeping that a positive and safe trail is always a concern for everyone.\nAlso, Idlewild Park is the most used park in Easton, so we need to keep it updated for everyone. The play area needs some attention, and why not do a pickleball court, since its popularity has grown 52% since 2019?\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Her passing was peaceful as she was comforted and held by her youngest daughter, Anne.Ruth was born on August 21st, 1928, to Annie Elmira Eckert and Nevin Emanuel Dietrich in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. Ruth loved and cherished her sister, Agnes Breidegam and her three brothers, Ivan, Ray, and Lloyd Dietrich, who preceded her in death.After graduating from high school, Ruth attended Mansfield State Teacher's College, in Pennsylvania. A devoted student, Ruth, earned a BA in Education, with French as her minor.She completed a graduate degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.She was a believer in attaining education and she so enjoyed learning, especially foreign languages.She was fluent in German and French.Ruth was a teacher for several years in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania.Ruth married the late Hubert Chester Santucci on August 22,1953, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Upon their move to Easton, Maryland, Ruth continued teaching for several more years at St. Michaels High School. Following the births of her daughters, she focused on raising her children and supporting her husband, Hubert, as he continued his employment as principal of Easton High School, and later as Supervisor of Instruction at the Talbot County School Board.Ruth was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She always said she would \"fight tigers for her daughters\". She was a nurturer, a protector, and provided calm council for her family. As her husband's health declined, she was his strength. A quiet sentinel at his casket, gently placing his sleep toboggan on his head, so he wouldn't feel cold. A calm enduring presence following his death to give comfort to all the family who were grieving.Ruth was of the Depression Era. She never asked for much and was content with what she did have. She always put others feelings ahead of her own and it was most important for her to conduct herself in a ladylike manner. She never wanted to cause distress or inconvenience for anyone. A resilient lady, calm in a crisis, always lending emotional support to others.A member of St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Ruth had a strong faith. She did not fear death. She was confident she would be surrounded by her loved ones when she passed.Ruth is survived by her daughters, Lisa Santucci Dunphy, Amy Santucci Parrish, and Anne Kay Santucci; granddaughter, Kathryn Taylor Raver and her husband, Adam; grandson, William Chester Parrish, and his wife, Arianne; her great-grandchildren James Hubert Raver and Peyton Louis Raver; her sons-in-law, John Dunphy and Randy Parrish. Ruth will be cremated and her remains will be buried with her cherished husband, Hubert Chester Santucci, at the Eastern Shore Veteran's Cemetery.As Ruth had a love of learning and teaching, in lieu of flowers, she would have appreciated a donation to the Talbot County Free Library of Easton, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Film Festival showcases artists' perspectives for record-breaking crowds\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Headlines \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — While the Chesapeake Film Festival's focus this year largely dealt with environment and women's empowerment, the \"rhythm, motion and meaning\" section shown at the Academy Art Museum on Saturday afternoon veered into something different.There were two screenings: a documentary feature called \"Lives Beyond Motion,\" directed by Keith Glassman, and a documentary short called \"100 Foot Photo,\" directed by Matt Kresling.\nThe festival's Executive Director Cid Collins Walker said she chose to show these films together to balance the festival's commitment to films about women's empowerment with stories about men.\nWalker said this was the best attended year in the festival's 18-year history.\n\"Every year, we see an increase in the amount of support we receive for all the programming,\" Walker said.\nCommitting life to art\nAfter the showings Saturday, there was a Q&A with the director and producer of \"Lives Beyond Motion.\"\nThe film explored Glassman's existential question of why he and other men committed their lives to dance.\nThe film began as a low-budget, long-term project around 2008 with major progress starting in 2015 after bringing producer The Angel on board. Glassman interviewed around 20 dancers who, without knowing it, shared common loves, struggles and difficulties.\nGlassman's own career as a dancer ended 30 years ago after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This prompted his quest to understand why dancers commit their lives to the artform for such a long time.\n\"I decided their answers should be heard by a wider audience, which was the impetus for the interviews,\" Glassman said. \"Their specific answers about their experiences adjusted my perspective beyond my own, bringing in topics relevant to the whole dance community over the years, like the HIV epidemic.\"\n\"Lives Beyond Motion\" is Glassman's first documentary, and he said he's been submitting it to every film festival possible.\nAudience members went around the room describing what about the film resonated with them most. Multiple people spoke of the authenticity and vulnerability of the interviewees, which they said made this film personal and emotional.\nAn Eastern Shore connection\nMatt Kreslings short film follows the journey of 20th century American artist Robert Rauschenberg's trip to China in the 1980s, his creative relationship with long-time Eastern Shore resident Donald Saff and, ultimately, his creation of a long, scroll-like photograph he named \"Chinese Summerfall.\"\nThe 10-minute film explored the painstaking process of printmaking at a time when artists were physically cutting negative images and didn't know if they were done properly until the images were processed.\n\"I want my work to make you care because I care,\" Rauschenberg said in the film.\nThe Academy Art Museum will celebrate Rauschenberg's 100th birthday with the exhibit \"Rauschenberg 100: New Connections\" opening Dec. 11 and running through May 3, 2026.\nThe exhibit will include \"Chinese Summerfall,\" which is rarely exhibited due to its size and fragility, according to the Academy Art Museums website. It will also feature showings of Kresling's short film, \"100 Foot Photo.\"\n\"Receiving the support that we do from the community, from our sponsors, our partners, our patrons, makes such a huge difference for us,\" Walker said. \"We simply couldn't do it without you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Howell has been sacked a league-high 61 times, the product of a lack of offensive balance with the team largely abandoning the run for a pass-heavy approach.\nBrissett was 18 of 23 for 224 yards and three touchdowns in two recent games in relief of Howell.\nRivera last week benched Howell for Brissett, who then popped up on the injury report Friday with a hamstring injury that kept him out against San Francisco.\nNot learning until two hours before kickoff that he'd be starting, Howell threw two more interceptions against the 49ers in a 27-10 loss, Washington's seventh in a row, to give him a leagueworst 19 this season.\nAsked about the switch back to Howell after practicing with Brissett during the week, veteran tight end Logan Thomas said: \"Both of them are obviously different. But we're all professionals. We know how to work with either guy.\"\nIt's unclear if Brissett, on a oneyear contract and set to be a free agent again this offseason, is healthy enough to practice this week or play Sunday against Dallas.\n\"He's just been working with the trainers and everybody, and we'll see how he is,\" Rivera said.\nWHAT'S WORKING\nArizona's stunning comeback win at Philadelphia not only allowed the Niners to celebrate clinching the NFC's top seed, it boosted the Commanders' draft status. They could pick as high as second, pending the result of their game and New England's at home against the New York Jets.\nThat would give whoever's next in charge the chance to take one of the top quarterback prospects available, Ohio State receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. or a standout offensive tackle.\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\nThe offense isn't the only problem, and there are plenty of holes to fill on defense, too. Cornerback Kendall Fuller, safety Kam Curl and linebacker Cody Barton are all pending free agents, and Washington will need new edge rushers after trading Chase Young and Montez Sweat prior to the deadline.\nSTOCK UP\nOne of the few bright spots this season has been second-year running back Brian Robinson Jr., who averaged 4.9 yards a carry against San Francisco. Robinson has eight total touchdowns this season with 358 yards receiving to go with 708 on the ground as he has shown he can catch as well as run in the pros. \n \n Caption: Washington quarterbacks Sam Howell (14) and Jake Fromm (11) talk during pregame warmups before last Sunday's game against San Francisco. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This illegal, terrorizing behavior would be expected from a dictatorship but not from our government.Any doubt as to the in terrorem role ICE would serve for the Trump regime is quickly vanishing. ICE is for Trump what the Gestapo was for Hitler, a force to stifle opposition with threats, force and torture.\nKhalil has no criminal record. All he did was to exercise his Constitutional rights by organizing peaceful protests at Columbia that opposed continued funding for Netanyahu as Netanyahu committed well-documented war crimes against Palestinians.\nWhen confronted, ICE first claimed Khalil's visa was being revoked but, when informed that he has a green card, changed its story to state his green card was being revoked. However, the decision to revoke a green card can only be made by an immigration judge after the government procures a warrant, makes a legal arrest, files charges, tries the person, convicts the person and allows that person to exhaust all appeals.\nInstead of allowing the due process our Constitution affords every person – citizen or not – the Trump regime executed an autocratic move to stifle dissent and disappear a dissenter that resembles the manner in which Putin deals with dissenters in Russia. This amounts to government terrorism and follows the Trump regime's open repression of student activism and political speech, in this instance criticism of Israel and Netanyahu. Thus, the Trump regime has shown it will use immigration to suppress free speech.\nIf Columbia secretly colluded with the Trump regime in the arrest, it may be a result of the regime's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. Trump proved that he is willing to use extortion to achieve personal goals when threatened to withhold funding to force Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, so it is not surprising that Trump would use extortion to force colleges to kowtow to his wishes to silence dissent by wrongfully withholding the funds they are entitled to receive, but it is chilling.\nAmericans must speak out against this brutal and illegal conduct.\nJACK L.

The extensive revision includes housekeeping items and definition changes to make the documentation flow better.\nUpdates to the animal control ordinance include three full document reviews, hundreds of hours of work and strong collaboration from officials including Animal Control, emergency services and animal services, according to Nowak.\nA public hearing regarding the ordinance is expected at the commissioner's March 26 meeting.\nIn other business, Queen Anne's County Animal Services (QACAS) presented 2023 overviews and 2024 projections to the county commissioners.\nAnimal Services Chief of Services Kelly Hamilton presented a year in review and projections for the shelter moving forward.\nThe shelter continues to lead the way in providing care care for forlorn animals of the Eastern Shore with an impact stronger than ever, she said, it was a very successful year of diligent volunteers, engaging events, and successful community support and 2024 only looks to continue.\nThe organization considers itself a quintessential No-Kill Shelter of the state of Maryland and the Eastern Shore, Hamilton said, with the Live Release Rate determined by the number of animals leaving the shelter via adoption, returned to the owner or transferred to another shelter.\nThe national standard to be considered a No Kill Shelter is 90% and with a 94.6% rate, QACAS is proud to be one of 12 such shelters in Maryland, she said.\nA total of 1,324 animals entered the county's shelter in 2023, whether as strays, seized or transferred in, a 29% increase from 2022, according to Hamilton.\nThrough QACAS, 679 animals found their \"furr-ever\" families in 2023, she announced.\nNearly 900 surgeries were performed onsite ranging from routine neuters, to life saving procedures.\nThe shelter has ramped up its social media presence including facial recognition software to instrumentally connect owners and pets and help 166 animals find their way back home in 2023.\n\"It's amazing, the technology is there,\" Hamilton said.\nHamilton credited volunteers and foster families as the \"true heroes\" for their tireless dedication to the animals.\n\"It really takes our team to invest all this time and energy in these animals to get them ready for that adoption floor,\" she said.\nFoster families are imperative to provide valuable insight into an animal's behavior outside of the shelter to provide \"purr-fect\" placement for prospective adopters.\nPrograms include doggy day trips in hopes of enticing new foster families with a day of play away from the kennels, which can often snowball into full blown adoptions.\nIQACAS participated in a National Clear the Shelter Event to roaring success, seeing nearly 100 animals find homes in a very short amount of time, she said.\nOther community events include Puppy Yoga, donation drives, and partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department for the first annual \"Pawing in Love\" Fun Run.\nMoving forward, the shelter expects to see an increase in community involvement including school education programs and \"bigger and better\" fundraisers, Hamilton said.\nThe facility has undergone remodeling to include updated in house dental machines and a new lobby layout. The shelter is now home to new cat condos, improved yard spaces, and even surround sound speakers at the dog kennels to provide calming ambiance.\nWith its newly improved yard space, they plan to offer additional enrichment programs for dog training including daily doggie play groups.\nA complimentary behaviorist class is available for all newly adopted dogs. This program will serve residents who may be considering surrendering animals to the shelter for behavioral concerns or are in need of training tips, according to Hamilton.\nQACAS looks to continue leading the pack as a local No Kill Shelter with updated technology and infrastructure improvements to provide community critters the best care \"pawsible.\"\nMore information about the QACAS, including upcoming events can be found at www.qac.org/1425/Animal-Services. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Sweet Potato Day on the farm\n\n October 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1484\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was usually a cool, crisp morning as the rule of the farmers was \"dig the sweet potatoes after the first frost.\"Days before, the baskets would be pulled out and the space in the shed prepared for storage. Mom would make a large pot of vegetable beef soup and have freshly made biscuits ready.\nThe tractor had the flat trailer attached, and the boys climbed on board. Off to the field they would go. No music to listen to or cell phones to talk on — just country folks doing the seasonal Saturday morning \"thang.\"\nAs the tractor returned to the shed the filled baskets were lifted off next to piles of empty baskets, the sorting began — the sweet potatoes were placed in the empty baskets by their size.\nThe large ones for steaming for pies and bread, the medium ones for baking and the small ones for a quick pan of biscuits and to give to families smaller than ours who only wanted \"enough for a taste.\"\nWhen the work was done, and the delicious smells of freshly made soup filled the air, we all stepped into the kitchen where the big table was set with bowls, soup spoons and dishes of homemade butter. The hungry crowd quickly filled the seats.\nGrace was said, biscuits taken out of the oven, bowls of soup passed around — Mom standing, watching with a smile on her face.\nHowever, my sister and I would stand with scowls on our faces at the number of dishes to be washed, dried and put away. Saturdays on the farm, folks.\nAs we get closer to Thanksgiving, I will include Mom's sweet potato pie recipe.\nFor this first one today, we are taking a trip to Memphis. One of Elvis's favorite dishes is what's called Red hot Southern sweet potatoes.\nRED HOT SOUTHERN SWEET POTATOES\n3 ½ pounds sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed), ¼ cup butter or margarine (melted), ½ cup packed brown sugar, 1 ¼ cups cinnamon red hot candies, ¾ cup water, 1 package miniature marshmallows.\nPlace the sweet potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain water, and place potatoes in a large casserole dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar, red hot candies and water. Pour over the sweet potatoes in the dish. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until sweet potatoes are soft, and the candies are melted. After this, you may top with marshmallows and return the dish to the oven for 10 minutes to toast them.\nTOASTED SWEET POTATOES\n2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 medium), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Dice the sweet potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes, leaving the skin on. In a large bowl, mix together the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, garlic powder, and salt. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the sweet potatoes on top in an even layer. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the cubes are tender and browned on the bottom. Serve warm. Store leftovers refrigerated. Make ahead instructions: Make up to three days in advance and reheat in a 350-degree oven.\nSWEET POTATO SALAD\n3 large sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 small red onion (thinly sliced into half moons), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup crumbled feta, 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley. FOR THE DRESSING: 2 tbsps apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground paprika, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss sweet potatoes and red onion in oil then season with salt and pepper. Distribute them evenly on a sheet in a single layer. Bake until tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes then transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, make dressing: In a small bowl or in a medium liquid measuring cup, whisk together vinegar, mustard, honey and spices. Gradually pour in oil, whisking constantly until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Toss sweet potatoes with dressing, cranberries, feta and parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nINSTANT POT SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE\n3 pounds sweet potatoes (peeled, cut into three-inch cubes), 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 3 tbsps maple syrup, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cups pecans (chopped), 2 cups mini marshmallows.\nPlace the cubed sweet potatoes into the cooking vessel and pour in enough water to cover the potatoes. Select Manuel/Mode at 400 degrees, and set the time to 30 minutes. Bring to a boil. Using the handle grips remove the pot from the heat, drain the excess water and place it on the countertop protector. Add the sugar, salt, vanilla extract and butter. Using a masher, mix until smooth. Using a spatula spread the mashed potato, making sure you have an even layer, top with a layer of pecan and on top a layer of mini marshmallows. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When the preheating time is done, place the cooking vessel into the oven and bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes or until the marshmallows are golden brown. Remove the cooking vessel using the handle grips and place it on the countertop protector. Serve and enjoy.\nCRISPY SWEET POTATO FRIES\n1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 large sweet potatoes.\nIn a bowl combine salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cinnamon. Set this dry mixture aside to use at the end. Wash sweet potatoes and halve each potato lengthwise. Slice into 1/4 inch sticks. In a large pot, heat canola oil. In batches, cook fries in oil for 5 minutes or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with the cinnamon, cayenne mixture. My grandson Mason loves to dip his in maple syrup.\nSWEET POTATO BISCUITS\nCook sweet potatoes, cool, peel and mash well. To 1 cup of the potatoes, add 2 1/2 cups biscuit mix, 1/3 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup milk. Mix until a soft dough is obtained. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball; knead three or four times — do not over-knead. Press out to a flatten circle and cut into two-inch rounds. Arrange biscuits with edges touching on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a pre-heated 450-degree oven for 10 — 12 minutes or until golden.\nSWEET POTATO CHIPS\n2 large sweet potatoes, 2 tbsps olive oil, 1/4 tsp sea salt.\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees and position the oven rack in the center of the oven. Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible (1/8 inch thick slices). If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not \"chip\" crispiness. Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt. Lay out in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. Thickness of slices will impact cooking time. Check at 10 minute intervals during the second hour of cooking to ensure they aren't burning. Remove once crisp and golden brown. Some may feel a little tender in the middle but take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes or so to crisp up before sampling. Serve immediately.\nTWICE BAKED SWEET POTATO WITH GROUND TURKEY\nHere is another unconventional sweet potato recipe that my son John loves to make.\n1 pound ground turkey, 2 large sweet potatoes, 1/4 cup hot sauce (John uses Buffalo Wild Wings Mild sauce), 1 yellow onion (diced), 1 garlic clove (minced), 2 tsps chipotle chili powder, 1 tsp ground red pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp paprika, olive oil, salt and pepper.\nPreheat your oven to 425 degrees. Cut your sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and put them face down on a cookie sheet. Put in the oven to cook for about 25-30 minutes depending how thick they are. You will know when they are done if they are easy to push on, on the skin side. If you pull them out early and the inside doesn't come out easily with a spoon, you'll need to cook them a bit longer. While your sweet potatoes cook, start a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a bit of olive oil to the hot pan then add your garlic and onions to start cooking down. Once the onions are translucent, add the ground turkey and use a large spoon to break it up to help cook it a bit quicker. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Monumental advice on eve of Trump's inauguration\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I love watching the brides pose for photos by the Lincoln Memorial and the teenagers wriggle through TikTok choreography near the Washington Monument. Their modern hopes breathe life into the centuries-old wisdom of our capital city.I have lived in Washington, D.C., for years and still can't get enough of it. On sunny Saturday morning walks, my pace is casual, but the insights are profound.\nD.C. is a living lesson about what George Washington described as \"the last great experiment for promoting human happiness.\"\nThe inauguration brings new people to Washington, and I hope they will love and learn from the city as much as I do.\nOne of my favorite monuments is near the Capitol. Two iron cranes stand together. Their wings thrust upward and barbed wire falls from their beaks. Around them is a complicated mix of names: Japanese Americans who died fighting for us in World War II, and the internment camps to which their families and friends had been forced.\nYet I am fiercely proud to be an American when, amidst these names, I read President Reagan's words: \"Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"\nFew countries I've lived in have the strength to admit such a grave national error.\nThat urge for improvement is in our national genes. As the Constitution states, we're constantly trying to \"form a more perfect union.\"\nSure enough, a few miles away under a white marble dome stands a statue of Thomas Jefferson. He, too, speaks to us of striving for perfection: \"… Laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened … institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.\"\nWhile I respect the somber challenge of those words, I love his next, more whimsical, sentence: \"We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.\"\nFrom a breezy hill in northeast Washington, D.C., President Lincoln also challenges us. It's the cottage where he and his family escaped the city's summer heat, though Lincoln daily commuted to the White House. His dusty horseback ride revealed the stakes of the Civil War: wounded soldiers bumping along in ambulances and former slaves surviving in hastily built camps after escaping behind Union lines.\nLincoln welcomed allies and adversaries alike to the cottage for advice, sometimes looking out from the veranda over the not-yet-completed Capitol and Washington Monument. As a modern visitor 150 years later, I can stand in the same place. The buildings are completed. But which of Lincoln's hopes and fears are still in progress?\nAt a newer memorial, Martin Luther King, Jr offers optimism about the timescale of our national effort: \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"\nAt an even newer memorial closer to the Capitol, President Eisenhower puts a worldwide spin on our work of becoming a more perfect union: \"We look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed purpose — the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails.\"\nStrolling through the city, I love listening to leaders from different periods of our great experiment. I hope our elected representatives will as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "State says no to granite curbs in Maryland town\n\n March 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jane Bellmyer jbellmyer@cecilwhig.com | Section: News \n \n 317\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the struggle between historic sidewalks in Port Deposit and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA wins, according to the Maryland State Highway Administration.SHA has two projects in progress in Port Deposit; one to remediate flooding and the second to make stretches of sidewalk handicapped accessible. This will mean either leveling heaving granite stones or removing them entirely.\nVicky Rinkerman, town administrator, said that in this early phase SHA engineers have reported that the town's existing historic granite sidewalks and curbing are central to the study.\n\"Their intent is to keep as much granite as possible,\" Rinkerman said. \"However, they are looking for the most ADA compliant sidewalks.\"\nThat, she said, will mean a loss of granite curbing in areas where that ADA compliance will come into play. She added that the engineers offered no suggestions to the town on how to preserve what is not part of the project scope.\n\"We may look at other towns,\" she said.\nOne section of sidewalk on the north end of town will likely shift to skirt a utility pole. While many homes along Port Deposit's Main Street come right up to the sidewalk, Rinkerman said 145 North Main has some wiggle room. That will allow for a wider sidewalk in that area.\nMeanwhile, the SHA's drainage remediation study is also early in its process but town officials are voicing concern. Rinkerman will meet with SHA March 20.\n\"We will be asking about the culverts,\" she told the mayor and town council. \"We want to confirm their exact plan designs for the drain in Vannort Drive.\"\nQuestions to be answered by the SHA include whether or not there would there be a flap gate to prevent back flow, and if the catch basin and the drain pipe need to be enlarged.\nRinkerman said the town has time to prove its case with SHA since the state agency won't begin any physical work until 2027 at the earliest. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During that time when the council presidency was open, his fellow council members voted him unanimously to be the interim president. He is intelligent, thoughtful, well versed in town issues, and, perhaps most important, listens respectfully to those who serve with him on the council and also to those bringing concerns to the council.He brings civility to a difficult job.\nAt the time, he did not run for president of the Town Council, as he was very busy with his family. Now he is ready to take on the extra work. His fellow council members are still supporting him for president. They are not supporting the present president of the council who is running again.\nDon has been a high school teacher for 27 years in Dorchester schools and a volunteer firefighter for the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, where he rose in the ranks to become president of the fire department.\nAfter knocking on a lot of doors and talking to groups, Don enumerated at a meet and greet what people care the most about and how he plans to deal with these concerns.\nFirst, smart development which means that no more development or annexation will occur until the 1,000 units that are in the pipeline have been built. He will also see to it that the Town Council is included in any future discussions about when and where to build.Second, make it easier to access medical care in Easton. There are not enough doctors here to serve not only Talbot County but also surrounding counties whose residents come to our Memorial Hospital. He will ask University of Maryland Medical System and Anne Arundel Medical Center, what they are doing today to promote doctors to come to Easton.Finally, he also listed issues such as traffic; search for qualified candidates for Easton Police Department; and promotion of the new Easton Volunteer Fire Department training facility.Last but not least, civility on the Town Council, is high on his list.\nLENA GILL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Women to Watch event recognizes more than 200 local leaders\n\n April 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — More than 250 women gathered at The Avalon Theatre Wednesday to celebrate the unveiling of the annual Women to Watch magazine. From lawyers, to entrepreneurs, to nurses, to educators, a wide swath of the Mid-Shore was represented at this APG Chesapeake event.The women honored at the event were selected through community nominations, with criteria like community service, professional accomplishment and personal achievement being considered. More than 200 women from the Mid-Shore region were nominated.\n\"I think it highlights all the work that everybody in the community does and just how powerful our community of women are,\" said nominee Kari Mielke Clow, principal at Chapel District Elementary.\nOf the nominees, 16 women were selected by the Women to Watch committee to be featured in this year's Women to Watch magazine, which profiles impactful work being done by women in the Mid-Shore community.\nThere were three featured speakers at the event — Ivette Furneisen, lawyer; Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools; and Meisha Amia, nurse, author and entrepreneur.\nFurneisen is from Barcelona. She used her native language, Spanish, to help the Hispanic immigrant community navigate the legal system. Being from Spain, she too had to wrestle with visas, employment authorization and becoming a resident, she said. Already a lawyer in Spain when she moved to the U.S., she had to go to law school a second time to practice as a lawyer in Maryland.\n\"During COVID I had this clever idea, with a 6-month-old at my house, to go back to law school,\" she said. \"So I did it. I have been able to help a lot of people.\"\nFurneisen recently opened her law practice, Campbell and Furneisen Law Firm, in Chestertown.\nIn closing she said, \"It is on all of us to make sure the next generation of women are as strong as we are.\"\nPepukayi, who spoke after Furneisen, talked about what motivated her on her path to her position to superintendent.\nShe said she learned from the courage, confidence and communication skills of strong women who surrounded her.\n\"The courage for me to take risks, to fail forward, to laugh at my mistakes, to dust myself off and get back up when I got knocked down, to apply for jobs that I knew I would have to work really, really hard for,\" she said.\n\"The confidence to share my far-fetched ideas, to walk into a room where I was the only person that looked like me, but to know I could contribute and make a difference,\" Pepukayi continued. \"And being communicative to share my vulnerable stories, to be transparent even when it is not good news and to meet and mentor other young women… to seek to understand rather than to be understood.\"\nShe extolled the audience to help each other and to not let jealousy get in the way. She asked them to mentor younger women as they had been mentored.\nThe final speaker was Amia, a writer, labor and delivery nurse, and entrepreneur.\nAs a travel nurse with over 40 assignments, \"I treated my road trips like a 90-day evaluations on the job. I am getting things done, and I am like, 'Girl you have got to grow,'\" Amia said.\n\"The most important thing I am going to tell you today is do not be afraid to wander. Just because your path is different, it doesn't mean that you are lost. Your path is preparing you for purpose.\"\nThere were many sponsors of the event, including Easton Economic Development, Easton Utilities, Pohanka Automotive Group, Wye Financial Partners, Queenstown Landing, Shore Legal Access, Parker Counts, The Ivy, All in the Mix Bakeshop and Ruby's.\nAPG Chesapeake made a $5,000 donation to Foundation of Hope, a nonprofit organization providing cultural, spiritual, social and educational trainings to girls in middle school through an after-school program aimed at helping girls to become leaders.\n\"The event really came together early this year — we sold out a week prior,\" said Betsy Griffin, assistant regional manager for sales at APG Chesapeake. \"The speakers were fascinating and each offered snappy pieces of solid advice. How fun to watch the nominee's stand with a cheering section behind them during the event.\n\"Next year we hope to incorporate a level of mentoring for young people and are so appreciative of Foundation of Hope, as they do this type of important work,\" Griffin continued. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Reimagining Thanksgiving leftovers\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; Country Cooking | Page: 4A | Section: News \n \n 1228\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thanksgiving leftovers are just as good the next day or a couple of days later.Even Thanksgiving Eve, folks are looking in the fridge or under the covered dishes for a bite.I used to make individual platters, consisting of each food to be heated in the microwave, carried to work, or sent home with someone.Check on that elderly neighbor, or shut-in, or just someone living alone, and deliver a plate. As you sit around the table with family and friends give thanks for all our blessings, no matter how great or how small.Remember those who are serving our country at home and abroad. Remember those working Thanksgiving so we can be home.Remember the law enforcement officers, the hospital staff, the firemen and fire women, the EMT personnel - anyone who volunteered to work today so others could enjoy this day with family and others. We are all thankful for your continued service to us and our families.I know the cooks have already decided what type of meat to cook for Thanksgiving dinner, so I decided to do the leftover recipes today in preparation for the days after the big meal. We all tend to cook more than needed for two reasons - better to have more than needed rather than run out and we can eat leftovers for the rest of the weekend!Maybe you had turkey for dinner with the possibility of many dishes to create - turkey soup, hot turkey sandwiches with gravy, turkey salad, turkey chili and one of my favorites, the Bobbie sandwich.Maybe you cooked a large beef roast with plenty left over to make beef vegetable soup, hot roast beef sandwiches and beef cubes with gravy over rice. Enjoy the leftovers with much less stress. Now, let's get to some Black Friday shopping!TURKEY CARCASS SOUPPut parts of the turkey carcass in a large pot with 8 cups of turkey or chicken broth, 1 head of garlic (halved), 2 bay leaves and 2 sprigs of thyme.In a large Dutch oven, cut carcass to fit in the pot and add enough water to cover only by an inch. Bring to a boil over medium high heat.Simmer, uncovered about 40 minutes. Remove the carcass and add 2 cups dry diced turkey meat, 2 cups frozen corn, 2 cups frozen green beans (cut into 1-inch pieces), salt and pepper to taste, and 1 cup small dry pasta. Cover and cook for another 15 minutes.I usually add 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1/2 cup diced onions.TURKEY POT PIE2 tablespoons butter, 1 onion (chopped), 2 stalks celery (chopped), 3 carrots (chopped), 4 tbsp flour, 4 cups chicken or turkey stock, 2 potatoes (peeled and diced), 2 cups shredded turkey, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, 1/2 cup frozen peas (thawed), 1 prepared pie crust, 1 egg (lightly beaten). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Melt butter in a saucepan, and cook chopped onion until tender. Stir in celery and carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add potatoes and simmer until tender.Stir in turkey, parsley and peas. Pour mixture into the casserole. Top with pie crust and brush with egg.Bake for 30 minutes until the crust is golden.THANKSGIVING LEFTOVER HAND PIESOne 14.1-ounce package store-bought pie crust, all-purpose flour for dusting, 1/4 cup leftover mashed sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup leftover stuffing, 1/2 cup 1/4-inch diced leftover roasted turkey, 1/4 cup leftover cranberry sauce (plus more for dipping), 1 large egg, 1 teaspoon whole milk, leftover gravy (for dipping). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the pie crusts with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut out rounds of dough with a 4 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Gather and re-roll the scraps if necessary; you should have a total of 12 rounds. Spread 1 tsp sweet potato in an even layer over half of each round, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edge. Top each with 2 tsps stuffing, then 2 tsps turkey, and finally 1 tsp cranberry sauce. You may redistribute some of the filling among the rounds so all the piles are even. Whisk together the egg and milk in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Brush the egg wash around the edges of each dough round. Fold over each dough round to cover the filling, creating 12 half-moon shapes.With your fingers, press the edges together to seal, and then press with a fork to seal securely. Brush the top of each hand pie with the remaining egg wash. Make 3 small slits with a small paring knife on the top of each pie to let the steam escape. Bake until the dough is cooked through and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve warm with extra cranberry sauce and gravy on the side for dipping.BOBBIE SANDWICHSandwiches are extremely popular for leftovers because there's usually so much turkey or ham! What makes these simple and easy is because you already have the major ingredients. A popular one in my family is the Bobbie.It's a turkey hoagie or sub with stuffing, cranberry sauce sub. Grab a bag of your favorite sub rolls or buns and use your leftover turkey dinner dishes.The ingredients you need are mayonnaise, slices of roast turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Using a 9-inch to a 20-inch sub roll, lay the sub roll open and smear with mayonnaise.On top of the mayo, place thin slices of turkey - as much as you like. Try shredding the turkey so it looks like shredded beef or pork. On top of the turkey, place leftover stuffing and on top of the stuffing place cranberry sauce. Put as much of the fillings that you want. Roll the sandwich together and serve immediately. This sub does not need to be warm and tastes better cold.THANKSGIVING LEFTOVER NACHOS1 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp minced chipotle chili in adobo (plus more sauce for serving), 10 cups tortilla chips, 2 cups shredded leftover turkey meat, 3 cups shredded cheddar, 2 cups shredded Monterey jack cheese, 2 cups thinly sliced leftover cooked Brussels sprouts, 1 1/2 cups leftover cubed roasted butternut squash, 1 cup packaged french-fried onions, 1 cup lightly packed cilantro leaves or parsley leaves, 1/2 cup sliced black olives, 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapenos.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stir the sour cream and chipotle chili together in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wraps and refrigerate.Scatter half the chips on a rimmed baking sheet.Top with one-third of the turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts, butternut squash and fried onions. Scatter the remaining chips on top followed by the remaining two-thirds of turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts and fried onions. Bake until the cheeses are melted and bubbly, about 5 to 7 minutes.Drizzle the nachos with chipotle sour cream and extra adobo sauce. Garnish with cilantro, black olives and jalapenos.I'd like to wish everyone a safe, happy and healthy Thanksgiving! Please take the time to check on your shut in or elderly neighbors as they might not be as fortunate as others. There is nothing that puts a smile on someone's face like a nice big plate of food!As you sit down together at the Thanksgiving dinner table give thanks for all that we have and bless the hands who prepared this meal. Next week we take a trip back in time to the family farm. I'm thankful for all my readers, and God bless you all. \n \n Caption: METRO CREATIVE SERVICES\n \nThanksgiving leftovers can be reimagined in a variety of ways. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO - The misting rain held off as Whoville Honorary Mayor Doug Gray of Burrsville opened the fifth annual event 5 p.m. Friday, Dec. 1, at the Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company Community Hall.\"Behold, citizens of Greensboro,\" Gray proclaimed.\"The most magical time of the year has arrived.The Greensboro Whoville Village Holiday Park is back, more magnificent and grand than ever before.\"\"You see our big Whoville sign, but wait till it's dark; you can see it from space, I'm pretty sure,\" Greensboro Mayor David Spencer said.\"We're really proud that the fire company has partnered with us to allow us to move over here.\"Despite the forecast and the light rain that began a half-hour into opening night, visitors showed up to walk the 2,000-foot winding path past inflatables, about 50,000 lights and the Grinch's lair to enjoy the free festive holiday display hosted by the Town of Greensboro.\"We wish the weather could be a little better, but at least it's not freezing cold,\" Spencer said.The event takes place over the next two weekends.For the faint-of-heart intimidated by the Grinch's dreary lair, visitors had the option of walking along the outside of it. However, the Grinch, with his trademark onion, seemed fairly harmless as he sported a necklace made of Christmas lights.Over the past five years, town employees and volunteers have put on the event, adding elements and improving the experience.This is the second year the holiday village has been set up at the hall.Potential flooding from the Choptank River prompted organizers to move the popular event to higher ground last year.Inside the hall, about 15 local vendors had set up tables. By the last weekend of Whoville, there will be about 25, according to Town Manager Tammy Kelledes. Visitors could purchase hamburgers, hot dogs and drinks from the GVFC Auxiliary.Among the nearly two dozen volunteers were Spencer's grandchildren.\"It's a family affair,\" Spencer's wife Cathy said.Also represented were Public Works Director Brandon Cunningham's son and Community Outreach Coordinator Amanda Weaver's son, who volunteered as elves.Their job? \"To spread Christmas joy,\" Weaver said, smiling.Santa and Mrs. Claus greeted children in their cozy shed decorated by Brandon Cunningham's wife Katie Beebe-Cunningham.Although Santa Claus had seen only a few children during the first hour of the village festivities, he said he saw about 1,500 children last year on the first night of Whoville. Mrs. Claus said they usually gravitate towards her first, and then feel more at ease to visit the jolly old elf.At the end of the path was a silhouette Nativity scene set up by Greater Impact Church in Greensboro.It's been about a month of work for the town employees who set up Whoville this year.Public safety was top of mind for organizers, and Greensboro Police and Caroline County Emergency Services were on site.Although the town relies on sponsors and donations, it has yet to break even on the cost of putting on the event, Kelledes said.\"This splendorous affair is all thanks to the generous donations and in-kind contributions from our beloved community businesses and citizens,\" Honorary Mayor Gray proclaimed.\"It's a time to cherish with your loved ones, sip cocoa, and get lost in a wonderland of lights.\"For more information about Greensboro Whoville Village Holiday Park, visit the Town of Greensboro's Facebook page, call 410-482-6222, text 443-239-4160 or email aweaver@greensboromd.com. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nOpening the fifth annual Whoville in Greensboro are, back row from left, Whoville honorary mayor Doug Gray of Burrsville, Zac Braband as the Grinch, Brooklynn Spencer as Cindy Lou Who, Madison Braband as an elf, and, front row, Leonidas Weaver and Benjamin Beebe-Cunningham.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDirectional signs guide visitors to along Whoville's streets behind the Greensboro Community Center.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nVisiting Whoville, Santa Claus and little Natalia Fanicase of Stevensville wave to her parents as Mrs. Claus looks on. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Hagood, chapter president, has deeply researched Tilghman and his critical role as one of Washington's right-hand men.\nIn 1776, Tilghman joined Washington's staff. Washington often referred to him as \"family\" in written letters, Hagood said.\n\"He became, in a lot of ways, like a son to Washington,\" Hagood said. \"… They carried on a relationship until Tilghman died.\"\nTilghman's calling card was his duty of delivering the notice of British surrender following the Battle of Yorktown. Surrender came on Oct. 19, 1781, and Tilghman arrived in Philadelphia on Oct. 24 to confirm the news to the Continental Congress.\n\"It's probably one of his most recognizable accomplishments,\" Hagood said.\nHagood described Tilghman as \"hard working\" and smart, adding that he \"probably would have had a role in the future government had he lived.\" He provided leadership to patriot soldiers and often was responsible for finding food to sustain the troops, Hagood said.\nIn a letter to Continental Army General John Sullivan in 1781, Washington spoke highly of Tilghman.\n\"This gentleman came out a captain of one of the light infantry companies of Philadelphia, and served in the flying camp in 1776,\" Washington wrote. \"In August of the same year he joined my family, and has been in every action in which the main army was concerned. He has been a zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithful assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of which time he refused pay.\"\nFollowing the victory, a portrait of Washington was commissioned in 1781, depicting Tilghman and Marquis de Lafayette. Maryland-born Charles Willson Peale painted the portrait, which is displayed today in the Maryland State House.\nTilghman died in 1786, leaving behind his spouse, who spent many decades thereafter in Oxford on Tilghman's father's plantation. Today, Tilghman is buried at the Oxford Cemetery after being reinterred in 1971 from his original burial site in Baltimore.\nMARYLAND 400\nHagood, who has read all of the letters Tench Tilghman wrote to his father during the war, pointed out the Talbot County native's critical role in the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. At that battle, a larger and more experienced British army posed a significant threat to patriot troops.\nOwen Lourie, \"Finding the Maryland 400\" project director at the Maryland State Archives, calls that the \"first major battle.\" Lourie says the troops known as the Maryland 400, along with some from Pennsylvania and Delaware, reformed to attack the enemy after a damaging British charge.\nWhile there were massive casualties, Lourie says the Maryland 400 \"bottled up\" the British and prevented them from delivering a \"final death blow\" to the other continental soldiers that were escaping.\n\"It is probably not too much of an exaggeration to say that they saved the Continental Army,\" Lourie said.\nWitness to the heroic efforts, Tilghman applauded the Col. William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, Lourie notes. \"No Regular Troops ever made a more gallant Resistance than Smallwood's Regiment,\" Tilghman wrote in a memoir.\nLourie and the Maryland State Archives are working to identify and write biographies on as many of those soldiers as possible. There were more than 1,000 Maryland troops, and his historian work has helped identify over 800. He says he's focused on \"telling the small stories\" of those Marylanders that may not have been thought of in hundreds of years.\nLourie is presenting a history of the Maryland 400 at the Talbot County Free Library on Saturday at 11 a.m., an event sponsored by the Tench Tilghman Chapter which wraps up Tench Tilghman Week.\nDana Newman, library director, says registration is open online at tcfl.org, with limited spots remaining. It will also be livestreamed on Talbot Library's YouTube channel.\nHagood is excited for Tench Tilghman Week to return next October and for years to come.\n\"What better way would there be for us as a chapter to fulfill our mission of educating current and future generations about all of this than to have a week dedicated to Colonel Tench Tilghman,\" Hagood said. \"And this year, just start with one event. But the idea is, we'll do this every year.\"\nFollowing the Maryland 400 presentation on Saturday, a free program on how to join the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution will be held at the Talbot County Free Library from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Frederick Douglass Room. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maritime Museum hosts watermen's stories\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Business \n \n 992\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — A crowd of 100 people gathered at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum on Jan. 11 to hear story swaps from seven watermen.Big storms and big hauls were remembered, as were the regulations, cost of gas and Venezuelan crab meat that made net profits difficult.\nThese salty tales from yesterday were moderated by Brent Lewis.\nThis was a rock star moment for these men and one woman, who normally get up way before dawn and head out in the darkness to find oysters and crabs. The crowd listened attentively and often gave hearty laughs.\nWaterman and politician George O'Donnell offered the age-old chestnut, \"If you don't know how to cuss, you buy a work boat, and you will learn real fast.\"\nThe event was recorded for posterity by the museum at the Van Lennep Auditorium, and it was sponsored by the Upper Shore Regional Folklife Center. On top of the 100 guests present, there were another 30 on Zoom.\nBeing a waterman is tough. There is no job security. There is no health insurance. If they get injured, they are out of work, and there certainly is no pension or 401(k).\n\"If you wake up a watermen, every day you wake up with nothing all over again. You gotta be a welder, you gotta be a carpenter, you gotta be a mechanic, you gotta be a bookkeeper,\" O'Donnell said.\nAnd yet there is a glimmer in the eyes of these watermen who love it.\nThe watermen speaking at the event included George O'Donnell, Calvert Thompson, Jeff Harrison, Rachel Fazenbaker, Eugene Austin, Joey Sadler and Troy Wilkins. From Miles River to Love Point to Harris Creek and many secret nooks on the Bay, they worked many different rivers on the Eastern Shore.\nSometimes there are big storms with 50 knots of wind and lightning. If you are out there, there is no place to hide, they said. More than one described the momentary blindness that comes after a big lightning strike out on the water.\nThe watermen shared the stories of times they thought they might not make it back to shore.\n\"I had a five gallon bucket, and I was bailing for all I could. The floor opened up and you could see where the gas had been at, but it was burning. Just flames, on top of the engine all the way to the canvas. It was a bad time for a few minutes there. I called up a friend and said, 'I have blowed up. I'm on fire' and he said, 'What?! What are you talking about?' He thought I was kidding. And then another boy up Mathews Creek he came along and towed me in after we got the fire out,\" Gene Austin said.\nHe continued, \"I was sitting on the board, and I just started shaking. It just hit me. What had happened. To this day, I believe in guardian angels. When that heating block blowed up. I had a short sleeve shirt on and not one hair was burned,\" Austin said.\nIn sheer volume, the biggest waterman, Calvert Thompson, was nick named \"Butterball.\" He had people in awe when he told the story of bailing out the cabin of a boat with five gallon buckets.\n\"There were 35 knot winds and seas were around 15 feet. We were early spring crabbin' in Cape Charles, Virginia. The tide ran so hard you couldn't see the buoys. You had to wait for the tide to slack up, and then you went as hard as you could go to fish your pots,\" Thompson said.\n\"And it was so rough that day that Raymond kept backing the boat up. We had scuppers in the back of the boat, when the water would come over the stern, it was just small holes in the back that would let water off of the gunnels. I had white boots on, and I had water over top of my boots from the floor up. I hollered up to the pilothouse and said, 'Raymond don't back up no more. Just sit. If he had backed up, we literally would have been gone. We were lucky.\"\nOne time when he was 23 or 24 years old, the engine died, so he stood on top of the cabin and threw the anchor as far as he could. Then he pulled the line in to move the boat. He said he went seven and half miles in two and a half hours until he was back home in Little Creek.\nThe one lady on the panel of watermen was Rachel Fazebaker. She could crack a joke and had the crowd going.\n\"When it starts blowing 20-25, I say bye boys,\" she said. \"One time I was in five-foot seas and 30 mph winds and we were dredging. It completely unspooled, and we had to lower the boom. My knees were shaking the whole time. The captain taught me a lot that day and I said, 'I am not going out, not doing it. Not going out.' That captain taught me what not to do,\" she said.\nAs a 12-year-old, O'Donnell's mom would not let him crab out of Winchester Creek, where she could look out the window and make sure he was OK.\n\"Crabs were, number ones, were $8 a bushel. It was in my blood. It was all I knew. I was pretty much a capitalist, so once I found out you could make some money doing it, I kept doing it. That is all the incentive I needed, so when I went to the carnival, when I got where I could make five dollars a day, that was pretty good money,\" said O'Donnell.\nThe crowd oohed and ahhed with each story. When an hour had flown by, the master of ceremonies handed the microphone to the people in the crowd, who got to ask about five more questions, the most poignant being, \"are you a dying breed?\"\n\"Aren't there any young people doing this?\"\nThe answer was sobering. The average age of a waterman now is 58. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lawmakers may derail dreams of high-speed transit\n\n March 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 811\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers this session are debating their possible role in funding a high-speed rail project from Washington, D.C. to New York City, with some convinced the answer is clear: the state shouldn't have any role at all.Those who back the project continue to push for the construction of the Northeast Maglev, a high-speed rail that would run through Maryland on its course through the northeast.\nBut some Maryland lawmakers vow they won't let the state pay for one inch of it. Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George's) sponsored the measure this year that would have prohibited any state funding for the project, even though none has yet been requested.\n\"I felt like this project should not be built with their taxpayer money,\" said Williams. \"It's a funding issue. It's also an impact issue of the communities that it will traverse through.\"\nMaglev supporters consider it silly to debate a bill that would outlaw funding that no one has asked for. Williams' no-funding bill is currently stalled in committee, leading some Maglev fans to conclude a majority of the Maryland General Assembly is supportive of their high-speed rail project.\n\"I think the fact that the bill has been turned down (several) times tells you that it's not something that the General Assembly supports,\" said Wayne Rogers, Chairman and CEO of the Northeast Maglev project. Similar measures have been introduced since 2021.\nFor years, the U.S. has debated the idea of a high-speed rail system like the Northeast Maglev that would travel from New York City to Washington D.C. in just an hour. Maryland's leg of the trip would allow passengers to travel between Washington DC and Baltimore in just fifteen minutes, as opposed to the hour it currently takes.\nHigh-speed transit is a popular concept, in theory. Some 63% of Americans said they would use high-speed trains if they were available in the U.S., according to a 2015 study by the American Public Transportation Association.\nHowever, decades since the idea was first proposed, little progress has been made in constructing these high-speed railways. Lawmakers and advocates disagree about what's preventing the project from making headway, though.\nIn the 1970s, Robert Embry, the former Baltimore Housing commissioner, was invited to Japan to study their new railroad technology known as magnetic levitation, a step up from bullet trains. Embry came back home and promoted the Maglev project in its earliest days.\n\"My view was that America's ground transportation was inadequate and too slow and that this was the new technology,\" Embry told Capital News Service.\nEmbry said that even today, this sort of high-speed rail could have a \"significant benefit\" to Maryland, encouraging tourism and commercial growth in Baltimore.\nConnecting Washington and Baltimore via high-speed rail may not be so simple, though. First, getting federal funding requires an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), said Embry. This comes from Maryland residents concerned with the project's alignment and whether it travels through their communities.\nFunding issues aren't the sole reason the Maglev project hasn't broken ground yet, according to Rogers, the Maglev CEO. The project has to go through a \"review and approval process with 30 federal, state and local agencies\" before it can get permitted.\nThe Maglev project, which would run completely underground, would give commuters the opportunity to travel between Washington and Baltimore without the use of crowded roadways, Rogers said.\n\"We're not 10 years behind on our infrastructure, we're 50 years behind,\" he said. \"If we don't do something, we're drowning in congestion. We're eliminating economic opportunities because we can't even connect two cities that are 30 miles apart.\"\nAs it stands, the Maglev project would not rely at all on state funding; it would be solely funded by Japanese private enterprise and U.S. government loan and grant programs. However, Maglev officials say they don't want to rule out the possibility if the project faces funding concerns in the future.\n\"While this project is not immediately requesting dollars from the state, the conversation is about the possibility of — in the future — the state supporting the project financially,\" said Maglev advocate Adrian Harpool of the Maryland Minority Business Counts Initiative.\nSupporters of the project emphasized the need to keep improving transit options in Maryland.\n\"The bill would signal that the state is closed to innovative, future-oriented solutions to worsening transportation challenges,\" said Ian Rainey, senior vice president of the Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail.\nWhile a high-speed rail might be needed in some parts of the U.S., some question whether it's necessary in Maryland.\nThe sponsor of the Senate version of the bill, Sen. Alonzo T. Washington (D-Prince George's) said there are opportunities for high-speed rail elsewhere in the country, but he opposes the project in Maryland.\n\"It is not needed. We believe the MARC train is doing exactly what this project is trying to do,\" Washington said in the Senate bill hearing.\nWilliams said she plans to keep bringing up her no-funding bill until it passes. \"I will continue to fight for this issue.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That encompasses such then-novelties as fresh beef and strawberries, some of which the cop spirits away to share with his friend and assistant - or \"book,\" in the parlance of this tale.

The organization intends to increase and improve stormwater treatment practices on the Severn River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis.\n\"Agendas matter, elected officials matter, vision matters,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) said. \"For the sake of the country, thank God we have the 117th Congress and Joe Biden to sign those bills into law.\"\nAttending the ceremony were not only federal officials and members of Congress but also legislators from state and local governments around the Chesapeake Bay.\nLibby Garvey, chair of the Arlington County Board, said funds are going to be used in her community on a small tributary called Grandma's Creek.\n\"(The Grandma's Creek project) is a great example of community involvement and advocacy for a beloved neighborhood stream,\" Garvey said. \"This project is going to propose the installation of rain gardens to better manage stormwater and increase the protection of the creek.\"\nIn addition to rain gardens, the Arlington community will also have the opportunity to participate in organized tree plantings and pop-up educational events centered around nature, Garvey said. The funds for these projects will be derived from the Small Watershed Grants Program, one of three grant programs administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which is to receive $193 million of the $206 million.\nThe NFWF already has announced it will be giving $1 million to farmers in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, with the intention of implementing high-priority conservation practices that improve water quality.\n\"There are 40,000 farms in Pennsylvania, and many of them contribute nutrients and sediment to the bay,\" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virginia) said. \"So anything we can do to get Pennsylvania on board with Maryland, Virginia and Delaware will be incredibly important.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Trust, another non-profit grant-making organization, will receive the remaining $13 million from the EPA. The trust will use the money to assist local organizations involved with improving the bay.\nThis could include providing operational infrastructure like computers and other hardware, or funding employee training and professional development sessions.\n\"We have to do better on agricultural runoff, and we have to do better on stormwater runoff. We do well on sewage treatment and on other point source pollution,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) told Capital News Service. \"This $200 million is going to be heavily focused on grants that focus on non-point sources, and we should continue to see significant improvements.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black and Hispanic faculty underrepresented in universities\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Nira Dayanim; Capital News Service | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 816\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Black and Hispanic communities are underrepresented among university faculty at Maryland's six largest public universities, according to the 2021 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).This analysis does not include Maryland's online universities or historically black colleges and universities.IPEDS is an annual data collection system run through the U.S. Department of Education.These findings align with trends across the country, data shows.The U.S. Census projects that 32% of Maryland's population are Black and 12% are Hispanic.At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs - University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; Towson University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University and St. Mary's College of Maryland-less than 6% of the total faculty are Black and less than 5% are Hispanic, as of 2021.According to Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty at University of Pennsylvania and a researcher on college access, faculty underrepresentation is a widespread issue, though the specifics differ by university.Across Maryland, faculty demographics vary widely. At Towson University, 7% of faculty were Black in fall 2021 and 3% were Hispanic. At Frostburg State University, those numbers were about halved, with 4% Black faculty and almost 1% Hispanic faculty.Prior to 2022, Maryland's education code allowed individual public universities to implement their own plans for \"cultural diversity,\" which ranged in length and breadth. In 2022, a new code was instituted, requiring public universities to ensure that faculty, staff, and administration demographics reflect the state's diverse population.Between 2016 and 2021, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at the universities included in the analysis both increased by just under a percentage point.\"It really is amazing how little progress there has been in some ways on this,\" said Perna.According to Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of University of Maryland's College of Education, many people assume that faculty will diversify alongside the student body. This \"trickle up\" system is unrealistic, she says.The problem is multifaceted, says Griffin. Academia is tasked with generating a pool, hiring inclusively, yielding candidates, onboarding hirees, retaining them, and ultimately, promoting them. \"We have to do more in all of those spaces,\" says Griffin, whose research has focused on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in post-secondary education.According to Perna, one roadblock is \"invisible labor\" faculty of color often take on work that requires time and energy, but does not fit academia's standard promotion metrics.\"We should be looking at to what extent our definition of merit is very narrow,\" said Perna.Underrepresented minorities often spend more time serving on committees and mentoring students of color, labor that often goes unrecognized, says Perna. Come time for promotions, publications and course evaluations are weighted more heavily.As the student body has diversified, the gap between representation among students and faculty has widened, straining faculty of color.As of fall 2021, Black students made up 17% and Hispanic students made up 8% of the student body at the universities included in the CNS analysis. That was an increase of 10% and 19% since 2016, respectively.Faculty demographics remained stable.In 2021, the resulting ratio of Black students to Black faculty members was 60:1. The ratio of white students to white faculty members was 15:1.According to Griffin, while it's crucial for students of color to have role models and mentors of color, there isn't enough faculty of color to shoulder that responsibility alone.\"That's a load everyone should share,\" she said.A lack of diversity also impacts faculty of color pursuing tenure. At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs, in 2021, 71% of tenured professors were white, 5% Black, and 4% were Hispanic, according to IPEDS.A lack of diversity among tenured faculty can make it harder for some faculty of color to find mentors as they pursue tenure, though many members of academia, like Griffin, are trying to combat this by developing intentional mentoring policy.\"Mentorship that helps you build a sense of connection and community in your unit and in your college is also really important for helping folks get to tenure,\" said Griffin.Katharina Maisel, a bioengineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, co-authored a list of best practices for increasing diversity alongside several other faculty members in the STEM field.According to Maisel, diversifying the faculty, especially tenure and tenure track, takes intention at every stage of the process, from inviting people to apply, inviting people for internships, and checking your shortlist to make sure you're not just inviting people from Ivy League schools.But it's possible.In science, technology, engineering and math, says Maisel, a tendency to be overspecific in job listings can discourage faculty from underrepresented backgrounds.Using rubrics to evaluate a candidate for hiring or promotion can help ensure an objective set of criteria, helping reel in internal biases, Maisel said.\"If you as a department are really actively interested in increasing the diversity of your faculty, there are things you can do,\" Maisel said. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The extensive revision includes housekeeping items and definition changes to make the documentation flow better.\nUpdates to the animal control ordinance include three full document reviews, hundreds of hours of work and strong collaboration from officials including Animal Control, emergency services and animal services, according to Nowak.\nA public hearing regarding the ordinance is expected at the commissioner's March 26 meeting.\nIn other business, Queen Anne's County Animal Services presented 2023 overviews and 2024 projections to the county commissioners.\nAnimal Services Chief of Services Kelly Hamilton presented a year in review and projections for the shelter moving forward.\nThe shelter continues to lead the way in providing care care for forlorn animals of the Eastern Shore with an impact stronger than ever, she said. It was a very successful year of diligent volunteers, engaging events and successful community support, and 2024 only looks to continue.\nThe organization considers itself a quintessential no-kill shelter of the state of Maryland and the Eastern Shore, Hamilton said, with the live release rate determined by the number of animals leaving the shelter via adoption, returned to the owner or transferred to another shelter.\nThe national standard to be considered a no-kill shelter is 90%, and with a 94.6% rate, QACAS is proud to be one of 12 such shelters in Maryland, she said.\nA total of 1,324 animals entered the county's shelter in 2023, whether as strays, seized or transferred in, a 29% increase from 2022, according to Hamilton.\nThrough QACAS, 679 animals found their \"furr-ever\" families in 2023, she announced.\nNearly 900 surgeries were performed onsite, ranging from routine neuters to life saving procedures.\nThe shelter has ramped up its social media presence, including facial recognition software to instrumentally connect owners and pets and help 166 animals find their way back home in 2023.\n\"It's amazing, the technology is there,\" Hamilton said.\nHamilton credited volunteers and foster families as the \"true heroes\" for their tireless dedication to the animals.\n\"It really takes our team to invest all this time and energy in these animals to get them ready for that adoption floor,\" she said.\nFoster families are imperative to provide valuable insight into an animal's behavior outside of the shelter to provide \"purr-fect\" placement for prospective adopters.\nPrograms include doggy day trips in hopes of enticing new foster families with a day of play away from the kennels, which can often snowball into full blown adoptions.\nIQACAS participated in a National Clear the Shelter Event to roaring success, seeing nearly 100 animals find homes in a very short amount of time, she said.\nOther community events include Puppy Yoga, donation drives, and partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department for the first annual \"Pawing in Love\" Fun Run.\nMoving forward, the shelter expects to see an increase in community involvement including school education programs and \"bigger and better\" fundraisers, Hamilton said.\nThe facility has undergone remodeling to include updated in house dental machines and a new lobby layout. The shelter is now home to new cat condos, improved yard spaces, and even surround sound speakers at the dog kennels to provide calming ambiance.\nWith its newly improved yard space, they plan to offer additional enrichment programs for dog training including daily doggie play groups.\nA complimentary behaviorist class is available for all newly adopted dogs. This program will serve residents who may be considering surrendering animals to the shelter for behavioral concerns or are in need of training tips, according to Hamilton.\nQACAS looks to continue leading the pack as a local No Kill Shelter with updated technology and infrastructure improvements to provide community critters the best care \"pawsible.\"\nMore information about the QACAS, including upcoming events, can be found at qac.org/1425/Animal-Services. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis were sworn in by Mayor Megan Cook, marking the start of council's first meeting with its new makeup.\nAbbatiello defeated outgoing president Frank Gunsallus in a heated election on May 6. But all was cordial Monday night as Abbatiello shifted from his Ward 2 chair to the center seat on the dais.\nThe new council president thanked his wife and two kids, mother and sister, and town residents for their support during the campaign.\n\"We're facing a lot of challenges as a community,\" Abbatiello said. \"Growth, housing, access to medical care, traffic — these are just some of the things that we heard during the campaign that people are really concerned about. We do have some challenges ahead of us. And I'm looking forward to working toward solutions to those challenges.\"\nAbbatiello added of Gunsallus, \"Even though we disagreed and were at odds during the election, I want to thank Mr. Gunsallus for his service to the community over the last two years.\"\nGunsallus, whose term as president began in 2023, provided remarks before shaking hands with the rest of the council at the start of Monday's meeting.\n\"We haven't always agreed, but we've always shared the same goal: to do what's best for Easton,\" Gunsallus said. \"And for that, I am proud.\"\n\"To the new council, I wish you nothing but success as you take on the important work ahead,\" he added. \"May you lead with wisdom, listen with compassion and help Easton grow in a way that honors its past and embraces its future. I have every confidence that this town is in good hands.\"\nEaston residents came out in droves to vote on election day, with over 3,200 ballots cast, a town record for a municipal election. All three races were contested, but Abbatiello and Rankin secured decisive victories (69% of votes each) in two-person races while Davis won comfortably (54%) in a three-person race.\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Cook said she believes voters \"sent a clear message.\"\n\"They want to see respect and civility restored,\" Cook said. \"They want their local leaders focused and working together collaboratively to address the needs of our community.\"\nFollowing the meeting, council members shared excitement for the work ahead of them.\n\"I applaud all three of you for how you ran your campaigns, and I am delightful at the outcome,\" said Ward 1 representative Maureen Curry, who endorsed Abbatiello. \"And I am so looking forward to working with all of you.\"\nWard 3's David Montgomery, who made a somewhat surprising endorsement of Abbatiello during the campaign, said voters demonstrated a want for \"integrity, openness (and) clarity.\"\n\"I am looking forward very much to the next two years of working on this council and working together cooperatively, in a friendly manner, with respect for each other, even when we don't necessarily agree on everything,\" Montgomery said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Frederick Douglass' Valentine's Day birthday honored by his family\n\n February 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Frederick Douglass never knew his exact birthday.Like many born into slavery, the exact date was never recorded. Douglass knew it was sometime in February but not the exact day.\nDouglass chose to celebrate on Valentine's Day because his mother called him her \"little Valentine.\"\n\"Yes, he celebrated his birthday on Valentine's Day,\" Douglass' five-time great nephew Tarence Bailey Sr. said. \"Feb. 14 through Feb. 20, you can say it's the most important week of Black History Month because that's the week of Frederick Douglass' birth and death.\"\nDouglass has strong roots in Talbot County and throughout the Eastern Shore.\nBorn in Talbot County in 1818, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey Douglass was enslaved for 20 years in Baltimore and on Talbot County farms. He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"He spoke in Denton on Halloween 1883, and Douglas took the train from Wilmington to Denton,\" author and historian John Muller said. \"Then when he was leaving and he spoke in front of the County Courthouse in Denton... there was so many people they didn't fit inside. The crowd had to go outside.\"\nAccording to Muller, Douglass also spoke in Cambridge, St. Michaels, and many more Eastern Shore locales.\nDouglass and his work are inspirational to many Americans, but it goes deeper than just inspiration for the Bailey-Groce Family Foundation, Bailey said.\nThe Bailey-Groce Family Foundation is run by multiple Douglass family members who grew up on the Eastern Shore. It is one of two family foundations operated by descendants of the Douglass bloodline.\n\"I think for my family here from Talbot County and from Eastern Shore as a whole, it's a whole lot different for us,\" Bailey said. \"Being raised on the Shore and then having the relative like him, you look at it differently than the average person does.\"\nThree years ago, the foundation started hosting a birthday celebration for Fredrick Douglas between Feb. 14 and 20, close to his birthday and the anniversary of his death. This year's celebration will be held on Feb. 22 due to a scheduling conflict.\nThe birthday celebration is held to help fundraise for an African American Cultural Center and an African American Historical Society, institutions the foundation plans to establish in Talbot County.\nThe event will begin at the historic Avalon Theatre at 3:45 p.m.\nThis year's event will feature a homecoming performance by Ayla Dennis, who was featured on American Idol.\n\"She's actually a Bailey family descendant,\" Bailey said. \"So it's going to be a history making to have her singing at the Avalon, which was a formerly segregated theater down the street from where the slave auction once was, right there by the courthouse where Frederick Douglass spoke, having his relatives actually headlining for his birthday in a formerly segregated theater.\"\nOther entertainment for Douglass' birthday celebration includes a county group from Atlanta, Georgia; a concert violinist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; a featured poet from Brooklyn, New York; and many more.\nAfter the performances, the foundation will host a VIP dinner at the Waterfowl Building in Easton. The foundation wants everyone to wear African-style clothing to honor Douglass' heritage.\n\"Frederick Douglass was a very classy dude. We like to keep his birthday the way he would want it,\" Bailey said. \"He was John Q when it came to his clothes. Everything he wore was Brooks Brothers. So he was always dressed to the nines. So I know that at his birthday party, he would want everybody in there dressed as well as him.\"\nThe Foundation continues to host these types of events not just to raise funds, but to keep Douglass' legacy alive, Bailey said.\n\"Uncle Frederick is the main reason, the only reason that I that keeps me going, that keeps me pushing,\" Bailey Sr. said. \"The goal is much bigger, Fredrick Douglass himself is the inspiration, because if it wasn't for him I don't know if we would have made it this far.\"\nFor more information about the celebration or to purchase tickets, visit avalonfoundation.org/events. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "House GOP introduces bill to repeal Biden college plan\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration's plans to make college more affordable.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina), passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden's efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\" Foxx said, \"Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\"\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden's original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration's plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx's College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) praised parts of Foxx's bill, \"such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\" but the panel's ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning (D-Michigan) offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) offered a motion to remove the bill's rescission of Biden's SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\"The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration… creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\" Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Michigan) unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici's proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said those charges include \"quite a few\" traffic-related charges, but did not want to share the criminal charges against Biggs because they are pending.\nHinson said that after Biggs drove into the hotel, he fled the scene in his vehicle, leaving a significant portion of the vehicle's front bumper on the scene. Hinson said the bumper was helpful in identifying the suspect.\nThere were no reported injuries from the incident, but there was \"somewhat extensive damage\" to the hotel, Hinson said.\n\"The building was occupied, but luckily no one was injured,\" he said.\nHinson did not know if the room that the vehicle crashed into had been occupied or not.\nCambridge Rescue Fire Company also responded to the incident.

The tests discriminated against candidates while failing to \"meaningfully distinguish between applicants who can and cannot perform the position of Trooper,\" according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\"Discrimination in any form has no place within the Maryland State Police, and it will not be tolerated,\" Col. Roland Butler Jr., superintendent of MDSP, told the board Wednesday. \"We're committed to making meaningful and lasting change … [and] to develop new policies and procedures that ensure equitable treatment for all applicants.\"\nThe board — made up of Gov. Wes Moore, state Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck E. Davis — signed off on the settlement. The agreement must also be approved by a federal court before moving forward.\nIn response to the investigation, MDSP will change its current testing methods to prevent future discrimination in hiring, but the new practices will not be ready until after the next two MDSP classes start, Butler said. To adapt, he said, MDSP intends to change existing standards, including eliminating time requirements from different portions of the physical fitness tests.\nMembers of the Board of Public Works raised concerns about this interim period, with Davis questioning whether the unclear guidelines would lead to more discrimination.\n\"Now it becomes subjective, so doesn't that lend itself, potentially, to be more discriminatory?\" Davis asked. \"Now we don't know what's good or what's not as it relates to that time.\"\nButler assured Davis that strict monitoring of who passes and fails the tests would be in place, allowing MDSP to monitor areas of improvement.\n\"We won't have the other test in place at this time,\" Butler said. \"However, we're relaxing the standards that we have … We will be allowed to use those tests under the condition that we provide strict monitoring to see what the results are, to see who's passing, who's failing and we do think that we'll get a larger pool of applicants when we start to look at how we measure that test and how we evaluate it.\"\nOfficials said the new tests would emphasize fairness while maintaining safety requirements, including a test that would receive ongoing validation to guarantee it was modern, fair and relevant, as well as an aptitude test to look for integrity, self-motivation, critical thinking and judgment skills.\nThe settlement involved 48 Black and female individuals who were prevented from becoming state troopers due to the discriminatory practices, according to Butler.\nSince his appointment in 2023, Butler said, he has worked to evaluate and modernize the agency's practices.\n\"I remain steadfastly committed to cultivating a culture that will ensure inclusiveness,\" Butler said, \"one that allows the fulfillment of our mission, of values centered around integrity, fairness, and service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Medical center, juvenile justice top priorities for Shore lawmakers\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 883\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Securing funding for the new regional medical center and addressing local impacts of last year's juvenile justice reform laws are priorities for Mid-Shore lawmakers heading into the 2024 General Assembly in January.During a Tuesday meeting with the Talbot County Council and local stakeholders, the three Mid-Shore legislators, Sen. Johnny Mautz and Reps. Chris Adams and Tom Hutchinson, tackled a number of issues affecting the district, discussing ways to advance their progress in the upcoming legislative session.REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTERSecuring financial support for the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new regional medical center has long been a top priority for local legislators.The proposed 147-bed hospital and medical office building are slated to occupy just over 235 acres off of Longwoods Road near U.S.Route 50 in Easton.The start of construction is dependent on the project receiving a Certificate of Need from the Maryland Health Care Commission.The hospital system filed the CON application in January and anticipates a response in December or January, said Ken Kozel, president and CEO of UM Shore Regional Health.In a separate process, the hospital system is working with the Health Services Cost Review Commission, the state's rate-setting authority, to see if rate relief can be obtained to offset the cost of interest and depreciation for the project.However, MHCC will first need to hear from HSCRC to determine if the project is financially viable before making a decision on the application. Uncertainty lies in how much the HSCRC decision will weigh on the health care commission's answer, Kozel said.That relief, along with government funding, is key to moving forward with the regional medical center.Former Gov. Larry Hogan earmarked $100 million last December for the project in the state's fiscal year 2024 budget.During this year's legislative session, lawmakers secured $10 million in the budget for the new medical center, which the hospital system must spend by June 30, 2024, Kozel said.There's also a pledge for $20 million in fiscal year 2025, though it's subject to change, so the hospital system is asking Gov. Wes Moore to solidify that allocation, along with the remaining $70 million, he added.The county council and lawmakers can write letters of support to help ensure the governor is aware of the project, Kozel said.Del. Chris Adams (R-37B) expressed his vote of confidence and support.\"We want this project to happen as much as you do and as much as every elected official does,\" he said, \"And most importantly, as much as every citizen that will stand to benefit from the delivery of the services that are possible in a brand new facility and the quality that you get from your organization.\"JUVENILE JUSTICETalbot County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Bollinger and Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey raised concerns about the significant impacts resulting from the passage of juvenile justice reform measures last year.Bollinger said the legislature was \"wrong\" for passing the laws last year, highlighting a 42% increase in youth crime in schools and two provisions of the laws that have been particularly burdensome for local law enforcement.One provision bars police from being able to charge a child under 13 years old with a crime unless it's a violent crime, such as murder, attempted murder or rape.\"The worst part is that these kids know that, and the criminals know that,\" Bollinger said, suggesting that 12-year-olds could be implicated in illegal activities and not be punished for their involvement.\"They can do it in front of our face, and we can't do anything other than tell them, 'That's bad, you shouldn't do that,'\" he said.Under another law, police are not allowed to interview a child after they're arrested until the child has an attorney to represent them, even if it's to get more information or to find out if others are involved.\"I'm here to tell you that there's not a lawyer anywhere that's going to say, 'Sure, tell the police everything,' - they're going to shut them down on the phone without even meeting them, knowing nothing about the case, and then our hands are tied,\" Bollinger said.The increase in crime in schools is mainly from the county's middle and high schools, and the majority of the crimes are assaults, he said. And out of 114 reported assaults in the schools in the last year, 40 of them involved children under 13.However, Talbot County is experiencing less youth crime than some other Shore jurisdictions. In Dorchester and Wicomico counties, the number of assaults on both students and staff are \"dramatically higher\" than previous years, said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B).\"The good newsis every county is now talking about it,\" he said. \"The county executives on the western shore are talking about it, butis anybody going to want to make a change?\"COUNTY INITIATIVESWhile there are no specific Talbot County bills being proposed for consideration by the state legislature so far, the county is supporting the Maryland Association of Counties' 2024 legislative initiatives.Those initiatives include launching forward-thinking firefighter and emergency medical services incentives, providing transparency in education spending, modernizing local revenue structures and advancing comprehensive housing solutions. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nUniversity of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel speaks to Talbot County Council members and state legislators on funding for the new regional medical center in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oxford awarded federal grants to elevate homes, address sea level rise\n\n April 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 542\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — The Town of Oxford has been awarded two grants from the federal government.At a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Tuesday evening, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis detailed what those grants are and what the town knows about the awards so far.\n\"This is exciting because we've never been in the federal budget,\" she said.\nDuring Lewis' explanation of the grants, Commission President Tom Costigan turned to the residents in the room.\n\"I hope you all appreciate just how gigantic this is,\" he said, which was followed by applause.\nThe first federal grant of $2.6 million is for the elevation of 14 Oxford homes. Lewis said the town had spent time looking for interested residents, and it found 14 who were \"willing to sign on the dotted line.\"\nThose 14 residents agreed to committing 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated, Lewis said. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nAlthough she is not yet sure of exactly how this process will go, Lewis said she knows the money will go from the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.\nThe town was also awarded $143,000 to go towards the cost of doing these elevations to the town, Lewis said.\n\"Until we get some detail, (we) don't know how that exactly works,\" she said. \"But that was the notice.\"\nLewis said the town hasn't been contacted by anyone from the federal government yet regarding this grant award. She said someone pulled out the line items from the budget and sent it to the town.\nCostigan asked if there is a time limit on elevating the homes and spending the grant money.\nLewis said the government says to spend it in a year, but added that the town requested getting three years to spend the money in its grant request.\nThe second federal grant the town is receiving is for sea level rise adaption efforts. Lewis said $1.06 million will be put toward building the Eastern Shore's capacity \"to plan and mitigate impacts of coastal flooding and tidal inundation.\"\nSpecifically, it will increase the capacity of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's research in addressing sea level rise. Lewis said there will be two scientists at the NOAA lab in Oxford working on this, as well as a liaison specialist for the Town of Oxford and a liaison specialist for the broader Eastern Shore.\nLewis said that this project aims to help other Eastern Shore communities, too.\n\"The idea is to take what we do discover and what we are able to do here and carry it to places that don't have the ability,\" she said.\nCostigan asked if this means Oxford will become the \"epicenter\" of sea level rise studies on the Eastern Shore.\n\"You know, it's $1 million for that purpose alone,\" Lewis responded.\nLewis said this project will also study the town's living shorelines. She is hopeful Oxford will receive a tidal gauge as part of the project.\n\"It is written into this grant, so we have high hopes,\" she said about the tidal gauge.\nLewis is still unsure of exactly how this grant will be handled, but said she assumes the town will need to pay the invoices and get reimbursed by the federal government. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five burial plots were discovered.\nCherrywood Solar brought the team back to do an ground-penetrating radar to see if there were any more potential burial sights. Once the final report from that test comes back, the Burial Sites Preservation Board in Caroline County will review that data and make a recommendation of what area needs to be protected.\nCherrywood Solar, produced by NextEra Energy Resources LLC, is a 145-megawatt project in Caroline County.\nNextEra Energy Resources sent a press release to the Star Democrat Wednesday stating, \"We are cooperating with Caroline County and other pertinent agencies on the investigation. Once we receive clearance from the relevant authorities, we will resume construction activities.\"\nAll parties involved believe that there was no foul play involved. They are believed to be human remains of family members from previous property owners.\n\"Given the fact that the house on this farm is a late 1800s house, most likely it was a family burial plot that could date back that far,\" Dadds said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "One Book One Maryland presents “Kin: Rooted in Hope” author talk at Chesapeake College\n\n October 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Exploring family and freedom, 2025 One Maryland One Book author Carole Boston Weatherford and illustrator Jeffery Boston Weatherford presented a discussion on \"Kin: Rooted in Hope\" as part of the state's largest annual reading and discussion program at Chesapeake College on Oct. 7.Originally published in 2023, \"Kin: Rooted in Hope\" is an illustrated verse novel that serves as a work of art, history and personal genealogy through the authors' search into their family tree.\nConjuring ancestors and tracing historical roots from the Maryland plantation where Frederick Douglass was also enslaved to Civil War battlefields and to the founding of a black, Reconstruction-era village, \"Kin\" interweaves rhythmic poetic imagery verse and stunning visuals to give voices through multiple perspectives.\nAuthor of 80 children's books, Carole considered poetry her \"first literary language,\" which lends itself to a different flow of words to convey emotions for her than traditional prose.\nCarole is no stranger to addressing tough topics for young people in verse, including her 2021 picture book \"Unspeakable: The Tulsa Race Massacre.\"\nCarole said it is important not to shy away from telling children the truth and to ensure critical thinking and socially responsible civic contribution.\nA pin drop could be heard in the Todd Performing Arts Center auditorium as Carole recounted tracing her ancestor's lineage back to the Wye House plantation in Easton.\nVisiting the Wye House for research, Carole noted moving moments and powerful connections, including holding the enormous iron antique key to the home, something her ancestor must have held as well.\nCarole recounted visiting the plantation's burial ground, now hallowed with a plaque marking where the enslaved people of the house were laid to rest.\n\"I knelt down and cried and it was almost as if my ancestors had said, 'We have been waiting for you,'\" Carole said.\nCarole learned of an ancestor, Isaac Copper, mentioned in Frederick Douglass' autobiography, who was enslaved at the Wye House at the same time.\nThe Weatherfords' ancestors went on to fight for the Union in the American Civil War and helped found the historically black communities of Unionville and Copperville.\nIn creating the book, the Weatherfords came to discover, \"Knowing your history is generational wealth,\" Carole said.\nThe mother-son duo were proud to collaborate, and Carole said it was a dream come true to experience it all with her son.\nIn reconnecting with ancestral roots, the two's travels included the Door of No Return at Gorée Island, noted as the last thing Africans of the area saw before they were enslaved and shipped away from their home.\nJeffery utilized a scratchboard medium to \"bring people out of darkness into the light\" and often used his own family as character models.\nJeffery said working on the book gave him a greater appreciation and understanding for the work his mother has been doing since he was a child.\nOne of the biggest challenges faced while working on the book was connecting the dots, Carole said.\nComprehensive research brought Carole's nose into captain ship ledgers and the meticulous records kept by the Lloyd family, owners of the Wye House plantation.\nCarole noted the emotions in seeing the names of ancestors inscribed in estate inventory alongside bought and sold goods.\nSome information remained out of reach, like the exact ship names that brought her enslaved ancestors over, she said. Along with the tremendous amount of research that went into every page also came a certain amount of artistic license to create stories, she said.\nFor those piecing together their own family tree, Carole gave permission for imagination as long as it fit the narrative historically.\n\"Informed by facts, it is up to you to fill in the gaps,\" she said.\nCarole encouraged everyone to know their own history and seek out their own family stories regardless of ethnicity to inspire future generations.\nAmateur genealogy hunting doesn't have to break the bank, she said, with public libraries a wealth of information and often having access to ancestry data resources.\n\"When you are the only one who knows, you tell somebody,\" she said.\nStories are essential to know exactly what ancestors went through. \"Without stories, a family tree is just a map,\" Carole said.\n\"All of our histories are intertwined,\" Jeffery said, and by connecting with history, warts and all, we will find we have more in common than different.\n\"Names, dates and places are the branches of a family tree,\" according to Carole. \"But stories are the leaves that bring the family's past to life.\"\n\"Kin: Rooted in Hope\" is the winner of a Coretta Scott King Honor, the Claudia Lewis Award from Bank Street College of Education and the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award.\nThe Weatherfords have toured across Maryland to discuss the book as part of the One Maryland One Book program to encourage a love of reading and develop a deeper sense of community through connecting events.\nThe event at Chesapeake College was made possible in partnership with Eastern Shore Regional Library, Washington College, Caroline County Public Library, Kent County Public Library, Dorchester County Public Library, Queen Anne's County Public Library, ShoreLit, Talbot County Public Schools and The Needle's Eye Academy.\nMore information about the Weatherfords can be found at cbweatherford.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But new members won election to the county seat later that year, and they reversed approval of the development.\nWaterman and Queenstown fought the reversal but ultimately lost in court, with the Maryland Court of Appeals enforcing a five-year stay on the zoning of the property.\nWhen those five years were up in November 2019, the development proposal moved forward introducing concept plans and architectural guidelines in 2020.\nThe master concept plan approved by Queenstown in 2021, showed no strong opposition to it from local residents.\nPublic hearings were held after planning commission members found the master concept plan consistent with the town comprehensive plan.\nDuring those hearings in 2021, Barry Waterman, the proprietor of Waterman Family Limited Partnership, the property owners, told the commissioners, homes will vary in size but will resemble the historic architecture of Queenstown.\nMore discussion and potential agreement approval is expected at the commissioner's next meeting March 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This application is due in March, she said.\nStudents will be selected for enrollment via lottery, with all county students eligible to attend, she said.\nOptions for school facilities are still being explored with the hopes to mirror Frederick County and Anne Arundel counties' business park locations, Scott said.\n\"It would be a real feather in the cap of Queen Anne's County to have the first one on the Eastern Shore,\" Scott said.\nA public meeting about QACCS welcomes the community to learn more Jan. 25, 2025 at 10 a.m. at Kent Island Fire Department, 1610 Main Street in Chester.\nMore information including a petition of support can be found at QueenAnnesCCS.com and its Facebook page. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear — based on previous polling and community input — that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"… You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oxford commission approves changes to floodplain management\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 333\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — The Commissioners of Oxford approved an ordinance to amend the town's floodplain management ordinance. The changes would loosen requirements for residents seeking to make significant improvements to buildings.Commission President Norm Bell opened the public hearing for Ordinance 2416 and shared additional information on the changes made.\nPreviously for buildings in Oxford, owners were required to track and calculate the costs of any construction made since July 1, 2013 prior to making changes to the structures.\nIf all those improvement costs equal or exceed 50% of the market value of a building prior to the start of the construction, it would require the building to be up to code and raised in elevation.\nThe amended ordinance revises the definition of \"substantial improvement,\" removing the 2013 date and substituting \"the previous five (5) years.\"\nBell said the revision allows for a lean way for owners to make improvements on their buildings.\n\"What this is saying is we're only going to go back five years, or 1,825 days,\" Bell said. \"So it's shortening the period that you can take a look at the 50% requirement. It's liberalizing it.\"\nAn additional change in the ordinance was the revision of the \"agreement to submit an elevation certificate.\"\nAn elevation certificate is a form on which applicants for a permit to construct a building or structure show compliance with floodplain management legislation.\nPreviously people looking to make substantial improvements to buildings would need to submit an elevation certificate with a building permit application upon the construction of the foundation and prior to further vertical construction; and prior to the final inspection and moving in.\nThe revision removes the requirement of submitting the form prior to placement of the foundation and further vertical construction.\nAccording to Bell, the changes would make it cheaper for owners to have engineers/surveyors certify that the floor of buildings seeking improvements is above the mean high water mark and it lowers costs of the certification by a \"couple of hundred dollars.\"\nAfter answering clarifying questions from the public, commissioners unanimously approved the ordinance. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge City Council talks about amending CWDI Articles of Incorporation\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Changes to Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Articles of Incorporation could be coming down the pike.During a Cambridge City Council work session on Nov. 4, City Attorney Patrick Thomas outlined proposed changes to the document and detailed the steps necessary to make those changes. He said that if the City Council, state and Dorchester County Council all favorably recommend the changes to the document, those changes could then be adopted by the CWDI board.\nIn September, a group — which included Thomas, Cambridge's mayor and city manager, Dorchester County's manager and Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) — met to discuss proposed revisions to the Articles of Incorporation.\n\"So out of that came a working draft,\" Thomas said.\nThis is not the first time in the past year that there has been discussion surrounding CWDI's Articles of Incorporation. In April, Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout proposed amendments to the document that he felt would make the Cambridge Harbor project more likely to succeed.\nSpearheaded by CWDI, the project is intended to develop land along the Choptank River.\nRideout's efforts to amendment the Articles of Incorporation were postponed in May when, in the midst of a lawsuit filed by the city against CWDI regarding a transfer agreement, the two parties entered into mediation. The lawsuit was settled in August.\nPROPOSED CHANGESThe current proposed revisions to CWDI's Articles of Incorporation would address membership, board membership and the process of amending the Articles of Incorporation.\nSpecifically, if adopted, the amendments would clarify that the CWDI Board of Directors has the authority to amend the Articles of Incorporation as long as it provides the amendments to CWDI members (which are comparable to the shareholders of a company) for approval first. It also clarifies that the board of directors can amend its bylaws as long as advance notice is provided to CWDI members.\nAnother proposed revision expands the board of directors from seven to nine members. The two additional seats would be for the city and county managers. Thomas said the managers would serve in \"an ex-officio, non-voting capacity,\" and would be entitled to attend all meetings, including closed session meetings.\nThe proposed amendments also include two new sections regarding the removal of directors. They state that if the board of directors declines the removal of a director, then the appointing authority, such as the county or city, has the ability to remove them. This authority can only be used if the board member hasn't been attending meetings, has acted unethically or unlawfully or has an unresolved conflict of interest.\nAnother revision would change the resident agent from the city's legal counsel to CWDI's legal counsel.\nThe last change would make it so that the number of CWDI members is increased from one to three. Currently, Rideout is CWDI's sole member. Having three members would make it so that the city, county and state can be represented. Thomas said that for the city or county member to vote on a particular item, a majority of its commissioners or council members would have to vote on the issue first.\n\"So any action taken by the city member would reflect the majority of the council,\" Thomas said.\nDuring the council meeting, Hutchinson said that from the state's standpoint, for the state member to vote on a particular item, a majority of Dorchester County's state delegation should have to vote on the issue first. He said if a tie-breaker is needed, Maryland Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day should take that role.\nAt the end of the meeting, CWDI board Secretary-Treasurer Frank Narr said CWDI's goal is to make sure the Articles of Incorporation continue to reflect \"the original intent\" of CWDI's formation.\n\"And I think this moves in that direction,\" he said. \"So I appreciate everybody's willingness to work together on this, and I look forward to a true partnership going forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Volunteers from Baywater Animal Rescue brought a couple of puppies.\nBut the big draw was the kites.\nWings Over Washington brought a half dozen people who were flying small kites synchronized to music.\n\"We are a very active club,\" said Paul Dugard, who headed the Wings Over Washington team at Sailwinds on Sunday.\nDugard and three other kite fliers stood side-by-side and flew their four kites in tightly choreographed moves with Dugard barking commands into a headset much the way a square dance caller shouts moves to dancers.\n\"We've been fliying together for many years,\" he said, adding the group first started flying together in the 1980s.\nTheir years of experience showed as their kites crossed lines and then uncrossed. The four kites would climb into the sky together and then circle one another before reforming in a line, much like the precision flying of the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
