According to court documents, the State filed charges this week against Gwendolyn Persina, age 48 of Chester.Those charges include causing life threatening injuries while operating a vehicle, driving under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance and driving on a suspended license.\nThe multi-vehicle incident on the westbound span of the bridge had travel shut down for several hours.\nThrough the course of investigation, the Maryland Department of Transportation Authority Police Collision Reconstruction Unit determined Persina was driving at high speeds and erratically, contributing to the crash.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson said he requested the court to hold Persina in the detention center during the Aug. 29 bail review because she was on probation for a DWI at the time of the accident.\nIn 2022, Persina had been found guilty in Queen Anne's County Circuit Court of driving while impaired by alcohol. Her 18 month probation was still in effect at the time of the January incident.\nRichardson said he made the request because he believed Persina is \"a threat to public safety with her potential to drive in a dangerous manner again if she were to be released on pre trial supervision.\"\n\"The chain reaction collision also ultimately caused an innocent man to lose his arm in the accident,\" Richardson said.\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Persina on Aug. 27. During a bail hearing on Aug. 29, Persina was ordered to be held pending trial. A jury trial has been set for February. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hummingbird Inn: a bed and breakfast filled with love and community\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Owning a bed an breakfast was not a dream Eric Levinson had on his own. The plan was created alongside his late husband, Kevin Woloshyn.The Hummingbird Inn, located on North Aurora Street in Easton, is a product of their shared love of traveling and hospitality.\nThe foundation of the inn and their love began many years ago online, when computer monitors had one color and there were no graphics, according to Levinson. Levinson, who at the time was working in Manhattan, New York, in IT management, went on Internet Relay Chat and began talking to Woloshyn, who was from Alberta, Canada. They connected and soon began sending letters to each other and talking on the phone.\nEventually, they made the decision to have Woloshyn move to New York. Same-sex marriage was not legal at the time, and the couple had to find alternatives to be together through work visas, but once they, did they did not want to be apart.\n\"He was one of these life-of-the-party guys,\" Levinson said. \"He would walk into a room, and everybody was just enamored with him. He was very charismatic, and outgoing, and funny and silly, but extremely intelligent. He spoke seven languages. He and I traveled the world together.\"\nLevinson said Woloshyn was determined to help him find his passion. Bit by bit, Levinson tried to hone in his interest of traveling, cooking and connecting to people. He enrolled in the New York Culinary Institute and began working in a couple of restaurants in Manhattan.\nEventually the idea of opening a bed and breakfast came to the couple, and they decided it would be a project they could do together in the future.\nAfter years of being together Levinson and Woloshyn moved to Canada, where same-sex marriage was legal, and got married. The plan was to wait for same-sex marriage to be legalized before moving back to the U.S., and at the time the issue was being presented to the Supreme Court.\nBut just before same-sex marriage was legalized, Woloshyn was tragically killed by a drunk driver.\n\"Ever since Kevin was taken away, I realized that tomorrow is not guaranteed,\" Levinson said. \"You have to live every life to the fullest.\"\nWith the help of his sister Brooke Drake and his realtor (and future best friend) Jana Mewedith, Levinson found what is now the Hummingbird Inn.\nIt has become a popular bed and breakfast where Levinson hosts events such as weddings, dark dinner experiences, annual Pride events, halloween parities, tea events and fundraisers for local nonprofits.\nDrake said she is proud of her brother and the success he has found in Easton.\n\"It was their dream, and he's done a great job to bring that dream to life,\" Drake said. \"We, me and my husband, have just been so happy for him to have him be able to change his life like this and move forward into a wonderful community that's embraced him and made his inn a success.\"\nLevinson is known as an \"ambassador of Easton\" by many of his guests.\nDan Schumacher, a former guest and current Easton resident, credits Levinson's hospitality for bringing him and his husband to the town.\n\"Eric and the Hummingbird Inn have been instrumental in attracting new residents to the town of Easton,\" Schumacher said. \"I know a number of couples who visited because the inn allows dogs, can host weddings or because it's LGBTQ friendly (the latter of which attracted my husband Rob and I) … Many of us have purchased homes here and now call Easton our home.\"\nThroughout the inn, hummingbirds can be found in every room, framed on many walls and tiny crystal birds floating on every ceiling. In the entrance, there is a wall of framed cards and art of hummingbirds sent by guests called a \"charm\" wall, since that is the official name of a group of hummingbirds.\nLevinson said that for the vast majority of his life, he had no connection to the bird. But after his husband died, he began receiving many sympathy cards with hummingbirds on them.\nFor a while, he was confused by all the hummingbird cards. After a bit of research, he learned of the lore associated with the bird.\nHummingbirds are thought to take on the spirit of people who were charismatic and full of life after they had passed, Levinson said.\n\"I used the hummingbird as a remembrance symbol after he died, and then when the inn started to actually come together, I knew I was going to rename it,\" Levinson said. \"… Knowing this was something that Kevin and I were originally planning to do together, that's why it's called Hummingbird Inn — because it's in his memory.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Across from the entrance to the complex is an open field about the size of a football field.For most of the years that we have lived here that field was left in its natural state. That meant lots of wild flowers (chicory, daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, Joe Pye, milkweed, etc.).Also birds were among the inhabitants, especially redwing blackbirds, as well as many butterflies (swallowtails, monarchs, buckeyes, fritillaries, cabbage whites, blues, morning cloaks).Now twice a year it is mowed down to an ugly field of clumps of vegetation.And why? So I can see the bypass.To destroy such a natural magnet for native flowers, butterflies and birds makes a mockery of leadership that professes to care about the environment.My question is: What government agencies make this decision - town, county or state? I want the responsible government entity to be aware of the unhappiness that this brutal treatment of a formerly beautiful field has caused.JAMES CARROLL Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "CPS staff under investigation in Caroline County\n\n August 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Caroline \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An investigation into the work of Caroline County Child Protective Services is long overdue, county Sheriff Donnie Baker said.The internal investigation into CPS staff was prompted by an incident on July 13, where a social worker never arrived to a home where child abuse and neglect was reported, according to Baker.\nHe said the agency has been \"lacking in their responses,\" including showing up over an hour after being called or not responding to calls of abuse or neglect until law enforcement has already handled the situation.\n\"There are some issues that the local Caroline County Department of Social Services needs to work out, and we have been working with them for quite some time to work out,\" Baker said.\nThe state Department of Human Services is conducting the internal investigation. Maryland State Police are investigating the report of abuse and neglect.\nBaker and Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin met with the secretary of Human Services about a year ago to address long CPS response times.\n\"We were promised a lot of changes, and unfortunately, those changes have not come to fruition,\" Baker said.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services, which oversees CPS, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBen Shnider, director of communications for the state Department of Human Services, which oversees the Caroline County department, wrote in an email to the Star Democrat, \"The safety and well-being of Maryland's children is our highest priority, and local departments of social services respond to every report of alleged child abuse or neglect.\"\nAccording to Department of Human Services policy, the Caroline County Child Protective Services response times fall within the guidelines for responding to reports for the examples that Baker cited.\nThe policy calls for:\nAnswering calls of physical or sexual abuse within 24 hours.Answering calls for reports of neglect within five calendar days.Answering calls for cases of substance-exposed newborns within 48 hours.\nBut Baker and Franklin said this policy leaves law enforcement to act as a middle man, but addressing the problem is complicated.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services is a state-run agency over which the county has no control, making it difficult for local agencies and officials to affect change, Franklin said.\n\"I have no power to enforce changes, I can only make recommendations,\" Franklin said.\nBaker and Franklin said there have been unfulfilled promises of solutions since the problems began during the pandemic but were vague as to what those problems and promises were, saying they wanted to preserve their working relationships with CPS.\nBoth said they want a better working relationship with Child Protective Services. State law mandates law enforcement agencies working with CPS.\nAfter-hours reports of child neglect or abuse can be handled in a few different ways. In cases involving high or even moderate risks, a Child Protective Services case worker should be automatically dispatched, but if they cannot respond, law enforcement, generally the sheriff's office, will be sent.\nBecause of the mandated joint investigations, Baker said law enforcement officers have been picking up the slack when the case workers do not arrive, leading to increased frustration by the officers on the scene.\nPart of the problem may be vacancies in the state Department of Human Services, where there is a 7% vacancy rate, although Baker said he thinks the root cause stems from procedural and cultural issues that start with upper management.\n\"I would say that everything starts from upper management and works its way down as far as a cultural issue,\" he said. \"And I think that there are some procedural issues within the agency itself.\"\nBaker spent a majority of his career working in child abuse investigations and said they are near and dear to his heart.\n\"I know how hard that is, so it's very disheartening to me when we do not have good partners,\" Baker said.\nShnider, the Department of Human Services communications director, said his agency \"is committed to holding ourselves accountable.\" His email statement said the department will address any systemic issues that are identified through the investigation.\n\"Any failure to respond to a report of abuse or neglect in a timely manner is unacceptable,\" Shnider said. \"When mistakes are made, we hold ourselves accountable and take action to ensure we do better moving forward.\"\nIn the meantime, Baker and Franklin hope the investigation will bring systemic change that will enhance their partnerships and the safety of the children in Caroline County.\n\"I hope that some accountability and changes will come to better protect the kids,\" Franklin said.\nThis report has been updated to clarify that MSP and DHS are conducting separate investigations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, local health departments will host listening sessions to understand community needs and solicit ideas and recommendations. Feedback on the program will close on Sept. 30.\nThe program will provide $50 billion to 50 states over the course of five years. Maryland is projected to see $100 million of those funds. However, the state still needs to apply for the program in order to receive the money.\nHalf of those funds will be distributed based on rurality, quality of the application and state policy, while the other half will be distributed equally among all states upon approved applications, according to Maryland Department of Health's website. Once applications are approved, funds will be distributed from 2026 to 2030.\nThe strategic goals of the program are prevention and management of chronic disease, behavioral health, sustainable access, workforce development, innovative care and tech innovation.\nThe dates of the listening sessions can be found at health.maryland.gov, and questions regarding the process or feedback on the program can be sent to mdh.transformruralhealth@maryland.gov.

Newnam Armory at 509 S. Cross St., Chestertown.Members of the Frank M. Jarman American Legion Post 36 came to pay homage to those soldiers lost on the beaches of Normandy that bleak day in 1944.\nOf the 2,501 US troops who died, many were from here.\nAt the foot of the stone monument, post members laid a wreath and flowers donated by The Mill of Kingstown, showing the Legion is just as active in the community as when they had their building at 9155 American Legion Road.\nThe monument reads: \"In grateful tribute to the men of the medical detachment of the 115th Infantry Regiment Maryland National Guard, both living and dead this shrine is dedicated. Their valiant efforts helped preserve freedom in America, 1941-1945.\"\nAt that sacred spot, incoming Post Commander Tim Lloyd, a veteran of the Navy, provided remarks.\n\"We lost some good people, and their sacrifice gave us our freedom today.\"\nCommander Paul Showalter talked about the clandestine nature of the mission the Kent County soldiers trained for at the Armory.\n\"Two days prior to June 6, 1944, the activity to get prepared to go to Normandy wasn't mentioned in (President) Roosevelt's fireside chats,\" he said.\nRoosevelt only hinted at it.\nIn the armory, built in 1931, was where those soldiers trained. From that training area, men went to the European theater and engaged in the largest amphibious invasion in military history, a battle that changed the trajectory of World War II. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This new special tax was designed to directly tie development to available funding for open space and recreational facilities for the public good. Now because of the state budget deficit the Program Open Space funds are being threatened with total removal for the next four years.Program Open Space supports parks, forests and wildlife management areas and is an important contributor to the state's conservation commitments and goals. It also supports community playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, hiking trails, historic sites, Chesapeake Bay water access and multiple other community benefits. These programs are important for citizens' wellbeing and also have substantial economic benefit. Quality of life is a very important factor in home and business investment in a community.\nI am impressed with the value of open spaces when I visit the Oxford Conservation Park and see the park being enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. I see toddlers running around, senior citizens — some proceeding slowly with the help of a cane, dog owners with their enthusiastic pets and many others enjoying the outdoors.\nI am particularly mindful of the many citizens who safely walked in the park during the worst days of the pandemic for exercise, tranquility and inspiration. The park also has become a highly valued locale for viewing wildlife with, for example, a large number of bird species identified, including recent sightings of quail.\nProgram Open Space provides very important benefits to residents of the Eastern Shore. I encourage you to contact our Talbot County representatives ask that they continue funding for Program Open Space.\nSARAH RAMSEY\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The community gathered over several days to celebrate.Many Black residents of the town and NAACP members marked the occasion by observing Voting Rights Day on Sept. 26, participating in Unity Day activities on Sept. 28, and appreciating the new signage placed at the entrance to the primarily Black residential community of Brooklyn in Federalsburg.\n\"Federalsburg was hosting. The town was the organizer of the event. It is the first anniversary,\" Willie G. Woods, president of the NAACP Caroline County Branch, said. \"We were there to support what was happening in Federalsburg. They had a cross section of vendors and participants and music and food.\"\nWoods said it is important to stand up and be heard.\n\"You have to come together and share your ideas, your viewpoints and your respective cultures. And you have to respect the contributions that the diverse population is making,\" she said.\nBrandy James, a Federalsburg Town Council member elected in last year's historic election, said the event was a success and that there was a good crowd.\n\"It symbolized unity to me. We had people from every aspect of Federalsburg. The faith-based community was there. Law enforcement was there. Not just Federalsburg police, but also the Caroline County Sheriff was there,\" said James.\nShe said there were many vendors there, including the Caroline County Health Department and smoking cessation resources.\n\"The NAACP has a table, Men For Change, there were churches with tables out there. They were giving away free cotton candy, and the kids had a blast. It was a great way to see everyone from across the lifespan come together and celebrate the unity of Federalsburg,\" James said.\nShe said the actual business of sitting on the council is slower than she would like, but she said everyone is being fairly heard.\n\"I am hopeful to see more African American people run for office in the future, and I am hopeful that the town business will get a little more streamlined and more organized,\" she said.\nThe Sept. 26 celebration and plaque were requirements of a settlement in a 2023 lawsuit brought against the town in federal court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nThe sign that was placed at Brooklyn said, in part, \"In coordination with the Mayor and the Council of Federalsburg, created an opportunity for Federalsburg's Black community to elect two representatives to the Federalsburg Town Council. Through their efforts, with support of the ACLU of Maryland and the guidance from the United States District Court, the town adopted and implemented a new and fair election system, undoing the 200 year exclusion of Black residents from town government. Federalsburg's historic election on September 26, 2023 resulted in two Black women winning seats to the town council: Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James. This day forever marks a turning point in Federalsburg's diverse community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — The St. Michaels commissioners plan to invest $215,000 from this fiscal year and next fiscal year into three new police vehicles for the St. Michaels Police Department.\"These guys are always in need for updated equipment,\" Alfred Mercier, commissioners president, said.\nThe company that St. Michaels is buying the police vehicles through will allow the commissioners to pay for one vehicle with this year's fbudget and two in next year's budget. The town will receive all three vehicles up front.\n\"These are all coming out of speed camera funds that are held in a separate account, so unless there's going to be changes in the FY26 budget, this should be something that we can accomplish,\" Don Richardson, town manager, said.\nWhile the budget for the vehicles is $215,000, the three vehicles will cost $146,820. The rest will be used for graphics, lights and equipment.\nJeffery Oswald, St. Michaels chief of police, credits the St. Michaels commissioners for their help getting the new vehicles.\n\"I would have to thank to the commissioners because they're always have the support on keeping our equipment up-to-date to match other agencies surrounding us,\" Oswald said. \"We want to keep our emergency vehicles safe and well equipped so we can provide public safety to the town.\n\"Our fleet is aging, so having the cost and the liabilities of an aging fleet, so not only it will save us money on maintenance, it will provide a better look to attract officers with new equipment and new vehicles.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Weiss said. \"My office will hold accountable applicants who undermine the integrity of the federal grant process by knowingly failing to submit complete and truthful applications.\"\nAccording to the settlement agreement, in 2020, UD accepted a grant from NASA, which is prohibited from using funds to collaborate with China or any Chinese-owned companies. While accepting the grant, UD certified that the money would not be used to collaborate or coordinate with China.\nHowever, the government later learned that one of lead professors associated with the grant, Xiao-Hai Yan, did in fact have ties to China.\nYan is a faculty member at Xiamen University in China, received funding from the National Science Foundation of China and participates in a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property, according to the settlement.\nThe settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by UD, nor does it prevent the government from pursuing criminal charges against any parties involved.\n\"Along with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to safeguard taxpayer funds that are intended for federal research and development programs,\" said Adelle K. Harris, a special agent in charge for the NASA inspector general.\nYan has been a UD professor since 1990. He teaches in the School of Marine Science and Policy and serves as director of the Center for Remote Sensing.\nAccording to a glowing profile of Yan on UD's marketing website, he is \"internationally known for using satellites in tracking the notorious weathermaker El Niño and in developing new techniques for monitoring global climate change and coastal responses.\" In 2019, he received the Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Advising and Mentoring Award from UD President Dennis Assanis.\nThe article also praises Yan for playing \"an integral role in the university's efforts to improve and expand the intellectual exchange between UD and Xiamen University\" — the Chinese university that UD failed to disclose Yan's involvement with while accepting the NASA grant. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As owner of Green's Septic, he and his employee of six years Pete Padley enjoy educating kids on the vehicles each year.\nOther than the big trucks, local and state emergency personnel were on site giving demonstrations.\nChief Logan Quinn from the Kent County Office of Emergency Services had lifesaving items on display: cardiac heart equipment, CPR devices and a pediatric response bag.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon presented some everyday tools they use to assist the public: bolt cutters, pry bars and jumper cables.\n\"When people see these items, we hope they see we're there for the community,\" Dixon said.\nWith a generous crowd scattered throughout the large grounds, it was calm, a good environment to learn, talking to equipment operators.\nThat calm was momentarily shattered at around 11:30 a.m. when a helicopter from the Maryland State Police was spotted hovering over the grounds. As soon as the chopper touched grass, kids and adults made a beeline to it, excited to get a tour.\n\"It's an impressive bird,\" said airline pilot of 25 years John Strigle. As a civilian volunteer he had a wealth of knowledge he shared along with the state police operators.\nThey answered questions, letting kids sit in the Agusta Westland AW139, creating lots of memories and providing parents with photo opportunities.\nOther than vehicles, the various Kent County 4-H clubs manned stations running activities for the public to enjoy. The Kent Fuzzy Tails & Shiny Scales group allowed a chance to pet the rabbits, talk to their owners and participate in a prize-winning activity.\nPrincipal Agent Associate, 4-H Youth Development Kent County, Beth Hill, behind an inventive bike/blender making pumpkin smoothies, said these kinds of events help generate new members.\nIn addition kids participated in a hay bale toss and Tic Tac Toe with pumpkins, while Matt Jones gave hayrides and various organizations like Rock Hall Dental fielded questions at tables.\nCo-organizer Cindy Moore said Touch-a-truck came about to show appreciation to the 4-H clubs who maintained the place year-round.\nShe thanked everyone for showing up that day.\n\"We all work together on this,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Perry White's sister (veteran character actress Mabel Albertson) vanish while investigating a voodoo cult in Haiti, sending Perry (John Hamilton) and Clark Kent (George Reeves) on a quest to find them.\"Freaky Friday\" (Freeform, Monday, Sept. 11): Filmed a couple of times previously and again since, this fanciful body-switch comedy has served the Disney studio well, including in this 2003 version. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are quite enjoyable as the mother and daughter who magically make the exchange, a therapist and a would-be musician who each get a new and quite deep understanding of the other by walking in their shoes, quite literally. Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray also appear.\"Magnum, p.i.\" (getTV, Monday, Sept. 11): \"Limbo\" is an appropriate title for the episode that concluded Season 7 of the series, since it originally was intended to end the entire show but CBS ended up renewing it for one more round. A seriously wounded Magnum (Tom Selleck) is in a coma, and his ghostly self pays visits to his friends to consider the times he's had with each. Elements of the story continued to play out over the first couple of episodes of Season 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now it continues through his son Ed Nabb Jr.\nAs part of the Carlisle Mission Team, Michael Marra collected funds for construction materials for island home repair, including ramps and deck rails for many of the older or disabled residents.\nEvery summer for the past 10 years, missionaries go to the island for vacation Bible school, outreach and more, according to Marra.\nSince the 1600s, generations of families have lived on the island that faces environmental distress, and it is enormously important to try and keep that culture going, he said.\n\"To let them know they are not forgotten,\" he said. \"We're there to uplift their spirits as well as their houses.\"\nThrough a match in donations, over $15,000 was raised with all funds donated by Holly Run participants supporting the work.\nA newer member of Chesapeake Sport Pilot, this was pilot Lenora Kandiner's first time participating in the Holly Run. Kandiner last flew to Tangier Island in the 1980s from New Jersey. \"You can't be here without hearing about the Holly Run,\" she said.\n\"Pilots always want to fly somewhere, so here's a good cause,\" breakfast elf volunteer Sandy Dewey said.\nMore information about the Holly Run can be found at tangierhollyrun.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lost in the rubble - How how high is the death toll in Gaza? - Biden, U.S don't trust casualty numbers from Palestinian health agency in Hamas-controlled war zone\n\n October 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n War casualty figures in Gaza - including the number of children killed - frequently cited by international groups and media outlets are being questioned by U.S. officials, including by President Joe Biden, because they are coming from a Palestinian health agency in the Hamas-controlled territory.The dispute comes as Israel Defense Forces step up already intense bombing of Gaza with ground attacks in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian area along the Mediterranean Sea.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday IDF ground forces have entered the \"gates of evil\", announcing the next phases of attacks against Hamas inside Gaza, which has a population of more than 2 million people.A sustained ground invasion faces grim realities of urban warfare and a rising death toll. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Friday Israel's \"ground war\" had begun with power and internet outages across Gaza and increased tank and artillery fire.\"Israel just launched a ground war on Gaza. Outcome will be a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions for years to come,\" Safadi said in a statement on Twitter/X.'THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE'The Palestinian Health Authority is the main information source from the Palestinian side for deaths and injuries during the war between Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas after the latter's Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel.Israeli officials said those attacks killed more than 1,400 people (including close to 450 children) and Hamas took more than 220 hostages. U.S. officials said 33 American citizens (many with dual Israeli citizenship) died in the attacks and there are also a still an unconfirmed, small number of Americans missing or also held hostage by Hamas The Palestinian Health Authority reported Friday more than 7,300 people have died in Gaza since the IDF started - including more than 2,900 children. Those numbers are going to expected to rise as the war continues, more ground battles ensue and Gaza civilians (close to half of them children) continue to get caught in the crossfires of the Holy Land war.But American and Israeli officials - including Biden - question how accurate the fatality figures are from the health group which is under the auspices of Hamas and its military and governmental control over Gaza.\"I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war,\" Biden said Oct. 25.\"I think we should be incredibly careful. I think - well, not 'we' - the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen,\" Biden said. \"But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.\" John Kirby, the White House's national security spokesman, reiterated Biden's point during a media session Thursday.\"We absolutely know that the death toll continues to rise in Gaza.Of course, we know that. But what we're saying is that we shouldn't rely on numbers put forth by Hamas and the Ministry of Health,\" Kirby said.Kirby also pointed to the bombing of the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which is operated by the Anglican church and Episcopal Archdiocese of Jerusalem, on Oct. 14 which the U.S. and IDF says was ht by an errant Islamic Jihad rocket.Palestinian officials blamed Israel for the Christian hospital blast and reported a disputed much higher fatality figure.\"Well, do you remember that attack on the hospital? And what did the Gaza Ministry of Health put out?Something like 500? They slapped the number of 500 on it, you know, within the hour of - of that attack. And, of course, they - the same ministry of health said it was an Israeli airstrike, so we know that's not true. And we've now since found out that the numbers aren't that high, either. They never got up to 500,\" Kirby said.\"They're just not reliable,\" he continued.'UNDER THE RUBBLE'In response to the doubts, the Gazabased health ministry released names, genders and ages of residents who have died in the war since Oct. 7.Media outlets as well as international groups frequently cite the health ministry numbers with some defending their accuracy. They also argue the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza should not get lost in other disputes.The United National Relief and Works Agency cites the Palestinian health agency numbers and said there are more than 1,500 people in Gaza missing \"under the rubble of destroyed buildings - including 870 children.\" Save the Children International, Amnesty International and other relief groups also cite health ministry numbers as they worry about the situation in Gaza, including the spread of diseases.Defense for Children, a Palestinian group, said the number of deaths in Gaza reported by the healthy ministry, could be lower than the reality of the ground saying there are missing persons \"under the rubble\" of the war and who have not been confirmed as dead or alive.DOC also blames the U.S. for the deaths.\"Israeli forces are actively committing the crime of genocide against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" said Brad Parker, attorney and senior policy adviser at DCIP. \"The United States is not simply standing by, but is actively enabling and supporting the gravest crime under international law making the United States complicit. Israeli warplanes are entirely U.S. sourced and the munitions killing Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are overwhelmingly American-made weapons.\" The U.S. backs Israel in the war and has moved two aircraft carrier groups, additional get squadrons and 2,900 troops - including a Marine rapid response force to the region. Biden wants Congress to approve $14 billion in military aid for Israel as part of a larger $106 billion war package that includes money for Ukraine in it war with Russia. The U.S. already sends Israel $3.3 billion annually in military aid along with significant outlays to Egypt and Jordan, who refuse to take Gaza refugees.The DOC group said the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire with lack of potable drinking water and more than 8,000 new COVID cases among Palestinian residents. \"Many people have resorted to drinking salt water from agricultural wells,\" the Palestinian group said.Oxfam International worries about the spread of cholera and other diseases with water treatment and sewage shutdown because of the war. Relief and groups say the situation in Gaza which has a population of more than 2.2 million (close to half of which are children) is dire.\"The situation for civilians is already intolerable. Our staff are telling us that in some cases, there are up to 70 people crammed into a single room.\" Amitabh Behar, Oxfam International's executive director.'SLEEPING WITHIN'On Friday, Oct. 27, Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzabella and other Christian leaders held a day of prayer calling for peace and the end violence and war in the Holy Land.The World Council of Churches and Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem are also calling for de-escalations of the war and the protection of churches and other places of refugees in Gaza. There are between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in the heavily Muslim Palestinian territory. Another 50,000 Christians live in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to the U.S. State Department.The push comes after Orthodox church leaders and the WCC say an IDF airstrike aimed at nearby Hamas installation struck the compound of the St. Porphyrius Church Oct. 19, which was built in the 5th century and is one of the oldest churches in the world.\"These blasts led to the sudden and catastrophic collapse of two church halls around the scores of refugees, including women and children, sleeping within,\" according to a statement by the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem. \"Dozens found themselves instantly crushed beneath the rubble.\" Eighteen people have died, including nine children, according to WCC.The Holy Land Christian churches have also called for more humanitarian aid be allowed into Gaza, for all sides to stop targeting civilians and for a ceasefire.HAMAS' FAULTThe IDF says misfired rockets from Hamas and other Islamic militants are resulting in deaths and injuries in Gaza, including the Anglican hospital blast, and that Hamas has stolen or hoarded fuel that could be use by hospitals and to operate water treatment plants and sewage pumping stations.\"Hamas is determining the level of the humanitarian crisis by not handing over that fuel to the United Nations,\" an IDF spokesman said Oct. 25.The day before, the IDF posted images of fuel storage facilities operated by Hamas in response to UNRWA pushes for fuel shipments into Gaza during the wartime siege.\"These fuel tanks are inside Gaza,\" IDF said pointing to reconnaissance photos and responding to the UN group's bid to get fuel included in relief shipments. \"They contain more than 500,000 liters of fuel.Ask Hamas if you can have some.\" The Israelis also posted social media graphics and information contending Hamas has underground facilities beneath the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Hamas continues to hold more than 220 Israelis (as well as some Americans with dual Israeli citizenship) in Gaza as leverage as the war and IDF bombardments rage and intensify. \n \n Caption: ABED KHALED/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA wounded Palestinian woman runs following Israeli airstrikes that targeted her neighbourhood in Gaza City, Monday, Oct. 23, 2023.\n \nNASSER NASSER/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPalestinian protesters hold posters and chant anti Israel slogans during a demonstration in solidarity with the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Friday, Oct. 27, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore legislators discuss education funding and county burdens\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Speaking to Eastern Shore legislators Friday, the Department of Legislative Services outlined how local governments may assume costs passed down from the state as Gov. Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Realtors work to protect themselves on job\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A15 | Section: News \n \n 584\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Smoke detectors and locking doors are obvious safety techniques for homeowners, but there is so much more to keeping homeowners and Realtors safe during the buying and selling process.Real estate leads come in many ways, and a referral from a friend or family member is different than a walk-in or website referral. Realtors are in a unique position that sometimes puts them in harms way.As a buyer or seller being aware of this will make all involved have a better understanding of why Realtors ask or do certain things.Local Realtors say they feel the most vulnerable at open houses and when showing property. Nationally, 4% of agents reported being victims of assault, robbery, theft and other undisclosed crimes.Many of the incidents occurred at open houses, home showings and in the agent's own vehicle.Although locally this is rare, it is still a possibility. Each September, Realtors are reminded about potential risks on the job and are asked to review the Member Safety Report (NAR.Realtor/Safety) for themselves and their clients.Allowing strangers to enter your homes always comes with risks, noted Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. That is why jewelry, valuables, and medicines, should be locked up or removed from the property.Some agents make use of visual recordings and posted signs that say \"camera in use\" to try to deter thieves. There was a situation a few years ago in Talbot County where a person was going to multiple open houses and taking prescriptions, the police and other agents were notified.Realtors also use a lock box system called SentriLock.SentiLock records the code of the agent who opened the box plus the time the box was opened and when the key was returned. A combination box does not have this protection, and once the combination code is given out there is no way to know who is entering your property.Rosendale said, \"I also speak with my clients about not showing their home by themselves, not all agents, and buyers are who they say they are. We tell our children not to talk to strangers.I tell my sellers not to talk to other agents or buyers and have them refer all inquiries to me.\" Here are a few ways some Realtors protect themselves and their clients:▪ They take a picture of the license plate of the buyer's car and the client's identification.▪ They do not drive or ride with their clients unless they know them well.▪ They hold the first meeting with the clients in the real estate office or a public location.▪ They do not hold an open house alone.▪ They never meet a client for the first time at a vacant property.▪ They use a smart phone or application to track their whereabouts and to alert colleagues in case of▪ emergency.▪ They have their phone charged, carry a charging cord and hotspot for poor cell phone areas.▪ They carry mace and maybe even a weapon.We understand that meeting clients in private locations can be a part of our job, as well as hosting open houses and showing vacant properties in areas with poor or no phone coverage, noted Rosendale.That is why it is important to take preventative measures and be aware of the surroundings to help the agents and clients stay safe from would-be criminals.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

Machinery used may include excavators, concrete saws, vacuums, cranes and trucks.\nAn on-site concrete crusher will recycle materials for haul roads and staging areas, reducing truck trips and cost.\nTypical large construction project noise is expected from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nEquipment is being installed in nearby communities to capture baseline noise and vibration data before the start of demolition and upcoming construction activities.\nBuoys will mark a safety zone, no entry area around active work areas.\nNotices will be issued to designate speed restrictions and safety zones to ensure the safe passage of vessels near the construction area.\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority said that it will continue to provide updates and advance notice of any work that may affect nearby communities, roads or waterways.\nBased on months of field investigations and engineering analysis, the bridge alignment is slightly east or downriver of the original structure, remaining entirely within the Maryland Transportation Authority's existing right-of-way. To proceed with construction, the Maryland Transportation Authority is requesting modifications to permits that have been issued by the Maryland Board of Public Works, Maryland Department of the Environment, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard in support of the Key Bridge Rebuild, according to the release.\nThe permit modification requests will reflect updates to the bridge pier foundation design, pier protection elements, and trestle configuration. They also include a decrease in authorized impacts to tidal waters and some additional impacts to non-tidal wetlands and waterways.\nA reevaluation of the project's categorical exclusion will also be submitted to the Federal Highway Administration.\nNo significant increase in environmental impacts is expected, the release said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Interdisciplinary in Computer Science and Natural Science\nOccupation: Installation Tech at Ustreamwifi LLC\nPrevious political experience: None\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nI love Easton. One day I hope to have a family here, and I want to ensure Easton stays safe and livable (not just survivable) for future families and its current population. It's also very important for young people to step up and get involved in our civil government and approach things with a new perspective and fresh ideas.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nFour points: Financial transparency and responsibility, public safety and stronger communities, smart growth and local business support, and infrastructure and quality of life.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThere is a lot of prospective future growth in Easton. We have to make sure the police are well funded. On top of that, the unnecessary fees for businesses need to be cut back, and the process needs to be streamlined. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nAffordable housing in not necessarily the answer. I want to take a stand that more starter homes be developed in Easton so young families (and old) can afford to live here.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nI'm pretty sure I addressed this earlier, but to expound: our police department is at least 5 people understaffed. That should never be the case. Increasing their funding while cutting ridiculous and unnecessary items would be the first item on the agenda (some might say that the town will then have less money to use elsewhere, but that just means they need to be more responsible with how they spend taxpayer dollars).\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI want to (above all else) listen to my ward. I want to be easily accessible, open minded to concerns and committed to doing what is right by them. I have been given a back to shoulder burdens, not to turn it on the people I am representing.\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We want to go back every year and let our kids have these ideal summers, running around barefoot in the grass and swimming in the lake. It has a really wholesome feel that really resonates with us, and it's great to spend real time there.Q: How have you enjoyed working with your husband. actor Jonathan Silverman (\"Weekend at Bernie's\"), on A: He's one of the kindest, most generous people on the planet and if he's going to do something with me (professionally), I want our characters to be completely at odds with each other. Frankly, there's nothing more fun than when you've been in a long-term relationship with someone and you know them inside and out - and you don't fight with them much - to go at it with them on camera. I can't even tell you how cathartic it is.We see each other all the time, and part of a happy relationship is a healthy boundary. Many people have said to us over the years, \"Why don't you guys do a show together?\" Well, it's because I want us to stay married! One of the reasons The CW wanted this show is that Jonny is such a recognizable American actor, and I think that's a nice advantage.Q: How does that work for you yourself, in terms of being well-known in both the U.S. and your native CanadaftA: I think a lot of Canada doesn't even know I'm Canadian. I think I've done nine series at this point, and I've been on everyone's television for 24 years.Part of my excitement in doing this show initially was to boost my profile in Canada, because I have always been patriotic and proud to be a Canadian, though doing a strictly Canadian show is something I've very rarely done. In the way my character Lidia goes back home (in \"Moonshine\"), this was going back home for me as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cristal explained that when you put pilings in, it's half in and half out, so at least 25 feet should be buried.\nWhen they are leaning, most likely they are cracked, she added.\nAnd Bramble pointed out no job is the same since the surface varies. Some surfaces are more sandy, or rocky, or like in parts up the river, there's mud.\nAlso there's the turbulence of the work. Waves are always pushing and pulling the boat and barge, which can lead to a highly dangerous situation. Workers could go overboard if not careful. The push barge with the excavator could tip, especially during the recreational months when people zoom by with speed boats and no consideration for the intricacy of their work.\nWhen the waves are too rough, they have no choice but to come to a complete stop and wait for waves to subside before going back to work.\"Our guys get frustrated,\" Cristal said. \"Summertime is not fun.\"\nDangerous, but in 41 years in the business, Bramble's had no incidents...knock on piling wood.\nAnd they stay busy all year round. After the Betterton job was completed at the end of June they were bound for Cecil County.\nBramble also keeps busy fielding questions from curious bystanders too who often stop and ask questions.\nHis wife of 26 years understands that fully, knowing the business in and out.\n\"What they do is pretty amazing,\" she said.\nFor a complete list of services they offer, visit www.bbpiledriving.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan, who has been one of former President Donald Trump's fiercest critics in the GOP, received Trump's endorsement in his Maryland Senate bid on Thursday in an interview on Fox News.\"I'd like to see him win,\" Trump told the network during a trip to Washington, D.C. \"I think he has a good chance to win.\"\nThe Maryland race could determine control of the Senate, a point Trump noted in the interview.\n\"I would like to see him win, and we got to take the majority. We have to straighten out our country, so I'd like to see him win,\" Trump said.\nHogan, who was a popular governor, is trying to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 ratio statewide.\nLate last month, Hogan angered Trump's campaign when he said that the public should \"respect the verdict and the legal process\" prior to Trump's conviction by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments.\n\"At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders — regardless of party — must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\" Hogan posted on X before the verdict was announced. \"We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\"\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump campaign adviser, shot back on X: \"You just ended your campaign.\"\nHogan, who is trying to navigate a difficult path running in a heavily Democratic state, has said he will not be attending the Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee, July 15-18. Hogan did not attend the party's conventions in 2020 and 2016.\nIn the past two presidential elections, Hogan said he did not vote for Trump, the party nominee. Hogan said he wrote in the name of his father, former U.S. Rep. Larry Hogan Sr., in 2016 and the late President Ronald Reagan in 2020.\nHogan is running against Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive of Prince George's County near the nation's capital. The Senate seat is open due to the retirement of Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "BAAM Celebrates new Soccer Field and 20 Years\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Not only did Building African American Minds mark 20 years of service Saturday, but the organization also celebrated the creation of a great space where children can play.BAAM has refurbished a soccer field for children with new Bermuda grass. They had a ribbon cutting to open the new field near Moton Park on May 11.\nLocated in Easton, the nonprofit provides scholarships, afterschool programing, summer camp, and more to empower at-risk youth in the community.\nA white tent full of local government officials listened to different speakers at a podium set up right in front of the field.\nFrank Gunsallus, president of the Easton Town Council, said, \"I want to extend special thanks to everyone involved in making this project a reality. From our dedicated town staff to our numerous community volunteers and generous sponsors.\"\nThe small crowd of officials clapped as the colors were raised on either side of the podium.\n\"Let's continue to support and invest in our parks and recreational facilities to ensure that Easton remains a vibrant and engaging community for everyone,\" Gunsallus said.\nDel. Tom Hutchison (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) came up to the microphone.\nHutchison said, \"You have done such great things for the community. This is a great addition for the children and youths that are here.\"\nHe presented citations to BAAM for U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin honoring BAAM's 20 years of service.\nMautz said, \"If you had been standing here 20 or 30 years ago, you wouldn't recognize where we are standing. I am looking forward to everybody kicking soccer balls out here.\"\nThe sound of DJ Hector could be heard in the distance as Amy Kreiner, president of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, came to the microphone to give a glass award to BAAM.\n\"It is my honor to present Derek and Dina Daily with this 20th Anniversary plaque on behalf of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce and blessings for the next 20 years,\" Kreiner said.\nThen they stepped onto the pitch for a large red ribbon cutting to open the field up.\nWilliam Ryan is president of the board of directors for BAAM. He was smiling as he wore a BAAM sweatshirt.\n\"We want to get our kids out playing as much as possible. It is part of the town park. It is open to all. If you want to have an event, you have to check with the town. We started out small and we have just been steadily growing,\" Ryan said.\nThere were members of the construction crew that actually built the field. It was a lot more than siting a rectangle. Lucas Lees, coastal and land designer of Unity Landscapes, had a three man crew that got the drainage on the field just right.\n\"We ran into water lines we weren't expecting, but since we were putting in irrigation it was convenient that the town already owned them. It really transformed this space and completed the park,\" Lees said.\nUnity Landscape built it in 45 days.\nDerick Daly, founder of BAAM, said that key is being long-term. The relationship with the town, the donors and the staff were all long-term.\n\"We wanted a place where kids could come and call it their own. We are opening up the soccer field with the partnership of the town of Easton developing with this field for youth soccer. Come out here and just have fun. Play and enjoy yourself, get out and exercise. This could be an incubator for kids to get exposure and take it to another level,\" Daly said.\nLooking past the new soccer field, there was BAAM Fest going on closer to the community pool. There were 31 community partners, whose colorful tents lined a winding sidewalk.\n\"We started BAAM Fest to give out information about what we are doing. It turned into offering a meal to everyone. We have free lunch for everyone. We have a band as you can hear, face painting — the kids love it. We have community partners,\" Daly said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Tench Tilghman: A Talbot County-born revolutionary hero\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 795\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — One of George Washington's most trusted men has roots in Talbot County, and this week he was celebrated by a local chapter of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.The SAR's Colonel Tench Tilghman Chapter honored its namesake after receiving proclamations from Easton and Talbot County for the inaugural Tench Tilghman Week from Oct. 19 to 24.\nTilghman, born in Talbot County in 1744 and educated there during his youth, was a primary aide-de-camp for Washington during the Revolutionary War. Wes Hagood, chapter president, has deeply researched Tilghman and his critical role as one of Washington's right-hand men.\nIn 1776, Tilghman joined Washington's staff. Washington often referred to him as \"family\" in written letters, Hagood said.\n\"He became, in a lot of ways, like a son to Washington,\" Hagood said. \"… They carried on a relationship until Tilghman died.\"\nTilghman's calling card was his duty of delivering the notice of British surrender following the Battle of Yorktown. Surrender came on Oct. 19, 1781, and Tilghman arrived in Philadelphia on Oct. 24 to confirm the news to the Continental Congress.\n\"It's probably one of his most recognizable accomplishments,\" Hagood said.\nHagood described Tilghman as \"hard working\" and smart, adding that he \"probably would have had a role in the future government had he lived.\" He provided leadership to patriot soldiers and often was responsible for finding food to sustain the troops, Hagood said.\nIn a letter to Continental Army General John Sullivan in 1781, Washington spoke highly of Tilghman.\n\"This gentleman came out a captain of one of the light infantry companies of Philadelphia, and served in the flying camp in 1776,\" Washington wrote. \"In August of the same year he joined my family, and has been in every action in which the main army was concerned. He has been a zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithful assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of which time he refused pay.\"\nFollowing the victory, a portrait of Washington was commissioned in 1781, depicting Tilghman and Marquis de Lafayette. Maryland-born Charles Willson Peale painted the portrait, which is displayed today in the Maryland State House.\nTilghman died in 1786, leaving behind his spouse, who spent many decades thereafter in Oxford on Tilghman's father's plantation. Today, Tilghman is buried at the Oxford Cemetery after being reinterred in 1971 from his original burial site in Baltimore.\nMARYLAND 400\nHagood, who has read all of the letters Tench Tilghman wrote to his father during the war, pointed out the Talbot County native's critical role in the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. At that battle, a larger and more experienced British army posed a significant threat to patriot troops.\nOwen Lourie, \"Finding the Maryland 400\" project director at the Maryland State Archives, calls that the \"first major battle.\" Lourie says the troops known as the Maryland 400, along with some from Pennsylvania and Delaware, reformed to attack the enemy after a damaging British charge.\nWhile there were massive casualties, Lourie says the Maryland 400 \"bottled up\" the British and prevented them from delivering a \"final death blow\" to the other continental soldiers that were escaping.\n\"It is probably not too much of an exaggeration to say that they saved the Continental Army,\" Lourie said.\nWitness to the heroic efforts, Tilghman applauded the Col. William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, Lourie notes. \"No Regular Troops ever made a more gallant Resistance than Smallwood's Regiment,\" Tilghman wrote in a memoir.\nLourie and the Maryland State Archives are working to identify and write biographies on as many of those soldiers as possible. There were more than 1,000 Maryland troops, and his historian work has helped identify over 800. He says he's focused on \"telling the small stories\" of those Marylanders that may not have been thought of in hundreds of years.\nLourie is presenting a history of the Maryland 400 at the Talbot County Free Library on Saturday at 11 a.m., an event sponsored by the Tench Tilghman Chapter which wraps up Tench Tilghman Week.\nDana Newman, library director, says registration is open online at tcfl.org, with limited spots remaining. It will also be livestreamed on Talbot Library's YouTube channel.\nHagood is excited for Tench Tilghman Week to return next October and for years to come.\n\"What better way would there be for us as a chapter to fulfill our mission of educating current and future generations about all of this than to have a week dedicated to Colonel Tench Tilghman,\" Hagood said. \"And this year, just start with one event. But the idea is, we'll do this every year.\"\nFollowing the Maryland 400 presentation on Saturday, a free program on how to join the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution will be held at the Talbot County Free Library from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Frederick Douglass Room. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was BBQ chicken being prepared by the hunky stepping dance troupe from Omega Psi Phi. With every flip of the chicken, these fraternity brothers came up with more highly aerobic, synchronized dance moves. It was like going into a '90s soul video with the smoky sweet smell of chicken.\"Stepping is something we all do to get together to unify us. It is mainly an uplift for events. This is our fourth year doing this. It puts us out there in the community.We do a scholarship.We all believe in education.All these guys are from the Eastern Shore and went to UMES or Salisbury,\" said Albert C. Jones Jr., or \"Queban.\" He said they were not done and will all get together to hop.One festivalgoer tried to sum it all up and thank some sponsors.Veronica Taylor, president of Groove City Black Heritage and Cultural Group Inc., said, \"It will be a rockin' party. If you weren't here, you should have seen the phenomenal performance by the Universal African Dance and Ensemble. A great performance.We started preparing for this in April. We get funding from grants, the city of Cambridge, the Elks Lodge and the Maryland Heritage Way. We get support from throughout the community like Dorchester Center for the Arts.\" \"My favorite part is seeing all the vendors on the street.We started in 2018. Five years. I want to thank the community for trusting in us to provide a good cultural experience for them,\" said Taylor as she looked over at a broken generator that was supposed to power the live stage. The large trailer mounted generator was not turning over, but they got it going after trying to jump it with a yellow van.On a more serious note, getting a solid education is the key to prosperity and the ability to give back to the community. It makes leaders in a community.Victoria Jackson-Stanley, former mayor of Cambridge, is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, which is a service based group. She was wearing the red and black colors of her sorority.\"We are a public service organization. We are here to pass out information about the mission of Delta Sigma Theta. We are part of the Cambridge alumni chapter.Scholarship, service and sisterhood those are our motto,\" said Jackson-Stanley.Lois McCord president of Delta Sigma Theta said, \"We do get out the vote. We work with young girls in our community.We offer scholarships for college.\" Not only could the community shake it and have a good time, they could also find vital resources to help make life a little better.This festival had it all including the smell of funnel cakes frying. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/TMCCA LL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nFood was a huge factor in the fun of Groove City Culture Fest.

Addressing that deficit meant Dorchester County schools lost after-school and summer programming.\nThe cuts to education come at a time when the county ranks 21st out of 24 school districts (including Baltimore City) in third grade literacy and 22nd out of 24 in overall English Language Arts proficiency in the state.\nThe Y is partnering with the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to create a space for the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading, a campaign that aims to target childhood illiteracy.\n{span}The campaign was inspired by the movie \"Sentenced,\" which was produced and narrated by NBA champion Stephen Curry. The film explores the epidemic of childhood illiteracy and its lifelong impacts.{/span}\n\"Dorchester County has, for a long time, been ranked very low in the state of Maryland,\" said Matthew Peterson, executive director of the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation. \"And so interestingly, now concurrent to all the work that the Y is doing, that we're all doing together, Dorchester County Public Schools is undergoing a strategic plan to go from 21st, to 15.\"\nThe Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading plans to approach this goal from multiple angles and with multiple partnerships.\nBecause third grade is a pivotal marker for childhood learning development, the campaign's target population are children from birth to age 5, so they are better prepared to enter kindergarten, and are less likely to fall behind.\n\"So we're trying to grab moms as prenatal because we're gonna do infant groups, we're gonna do, you know, toddler groups, mommy and me groups, so we want to bring awareness at early childhood,\" said Tynice DeShields, director of mental health at the YMCA of Chesapeake.\nThe campaign's partners include county schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson, the Dorchester County Public Library, United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, Operation Pathways and volunteers from the community.\n\"There's a number of agencies we've been working with over the years. You know, as any organization, some were more engaged than others, and so bringing everybody on board, finding out where that alignment fits best, and then trying to leverage that, to do the best we can, is what we've always tried to have,\" Peterson said.\nThe reading hub will be a space that is open to the public and YMCA members alike.\n\"We're building this reading hub as a meeting place where we can have a resource center, we can have meetings with the community, we can have sessions with the parents to teach their kids how to read, how to look at letters and numbers, and not just throw a book in front of them,\" said Bryant Wittington, director of the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading.\nPeterson, DeShields and Wittington are excited to engage with the community and hope to build a strong foundation of volunteers at the reading hub.\n\"We want to build that unity in the community,\" Wittington said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wilson, 59, on Thursday, police announced.The charges, which include acting as an accessory, altering physical evidence and obstructing and hindering a police officer, stem from Wilson's alleged involvement after the shooting death of Easton resident Ty A. Brooks in early August.Police responded to the area of 104 Blake Street around 7 p.m. Aug. 7 for a report of a person who had been shot and was laying in the grass.Officers arriving on scene rendered aid to the man, later identified as Brooks, until paramedics arrived. Brooks died from his injuries at the scene, police said. He was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore for an autopsy.Police said earlier in the day, Brooks argued with individuals that were near and operating a 2018 Land Rover Range Rover, which was parked in the 100 block of Blake Street.Brooks left the area and returned later, operating an ATV. Brooks confronted the same individuals with a shotgun, police said.Police said after the group exchanged words, a man seated in the driver's seat of the Range Rover fired shots through the front passenger seat window and struck Brooks' side.The man in the driver's seat was identified by police as Daseir Cornish, 22, of Denton. Cornish is charged with second-degree murder, assault, manslaughter and related charges in connection to Brooks' death.After Brooks was shot, he fell off of the ATV, police said. The Range Rover fled the scene accompanied by a gray Hyundai sedan.Police said Thursday that when officers were attempting to secure the crime scene and render aid, Wilson walked to the area where Cornish allegedly shot Brooks and retrieved his cell phone, which was dropped by Cornish. Wilson left the area with the phone, police said.Wilson was released on a $25,000 unsecured bond, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's about community - Chesapeake Bay Walk to Defeat ALS set for Oct. 22 in Centreville\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 892\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE - The Chesapeake Bay Walk to Defeat ALS is on track to reach its $35,000 goal on Sunday, Oct. 22, and organizers are hoping last minute walkers and supporters will join the fight.Walkers will sign in at 9 a.m. at Route 18 Park in Centreville. Even those who wake up and decide to participate that day can get in on the action and register at the walk.When Pam Clark Edwards of Centreville, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in February 2021, her family and friends not only rallied around her, they lost no time launching the effort to raise funds for the ALS Association.Edwards' daughters, Meredith Kulbacki of Centreville and Morgan Edwards of Winter Garden, Florida, spearheaded the Oct. 2022 Walk that rallied some 140 people who walked, ran and wheeled to raise over $30,000.Their team, Pam's Praying Pineapples, will be joined by 10 additional teams this year.As of the beginning of October, the local walk had raised over 80% of its goal.\"That's pretty amazing,\" Kulbacki said. \"I think we can definitely get close to that, if not reach it by the walk.\" The community has reached out to help. Other fundraising in the form of raffles and a 50/50 drawing will be held, and about 40 items were donated by local businesses.For example, \"we have a foursome golf outing at Queenstown Harbor, an official NFLfootball signed by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens, a gift basket from Draper Brothers liquor store, cosmetic gift bags, jewelry and various services,\" Meredith said.Fun activities include pumpkin decorating for kids.The ALS chapter from D.C., Maryland and Virginia will be sending helpers to be stationed at tables, so people can find out more information about ALS itself, and maybe about how they can help, Kulbacki said.\"If they have become a caretaker to someone with ALS,\" she said. \"There will be workers there to help them through that.\" Information will be available for people who have been diagnosed with ALS.In fact, some members of Edwards' care team at Johns Hopkins will be attending the walk Ebb Tide Tent & Party Rentals in Queenstown donated a large tent, while Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation donated the use of the park.Community support has been \"just amazing,\" Edwards said.\"Having the support of the community helps us as a family deal with all of this,\" she said.The Clark family has deep roots in the county. Pam and her husband, Fred, and Kulbacki and her family live on the family farm just down the road from the park where the walk will be held.Pam is a retired teacher in Queen Anne's County Public Schools.Pam's mother, June, and her brother Jeff have canvassed local business owners, who are supporting their longtime neighbors.Edwards' longtime friends and colleagues are part of the small committee helping her daughters. Connie Dean, Barb Thompson and Bobbie King have rallied around the Edwards family to help out where they can to help organize the walk.Kulbacki, who was raised in Centreville, spent eight years in York, Pennsylvania, and recently moved back. \"It means everything to me. It means family,\" she said.During the COVID pandemic, she and her family, which includes her husband and two children, decided to move back home \"on a whim.\" \"We felt so alone with just no family and (few) friends there,\" she said. \"We had no idea that this would happen.We say it was almost like God told us. He helped us through this, and it was almost a blessing in disguise that we moved home, so that we could help my mom and my dad and my family through this.\" \"So not only to be here with them, and then also to have so much support from everybody in the community and all of our friends and family - it's just amazing and we're so thankful for that,\" Mer said.Kulbacki knew about the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS through a sad coincidence. The mother of a close friend in Pennsylvania died from ALS about a year before the Kulbackis moved to Maryland, and Kulbacki had participated in a Pennsylvania Walk in memory of Becky Miller's mom.\"I didn't know that it would affect me so deeply a year later, so it's been amazing to still be friends with her and have support from her because she knows what I'm going through,\" Mer said.\"You never know when ALS may affect a friend or family member,\" Edwards said. \"It is becoming, I think, more prevalent. I know five people who have passed away from it, not because I have been in this situation - these are people who have been in my life.\" \"It's a disease that they really do not have a treatment or cure for yet, and we just need to put money into the resources for help for these families, as well as to provide money for research,\" she said.To register online for the Oct. 22 Walk, visit Walkto-DefeatALS.org.For more information about the ALS Association, donating your time or resources and supporting the Walk to Defeat ALS Chesapeake Bay, visit als.org or contact coordinator Tara Huang at tara.huang@als.org. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTeam Chesapeake Bay is ready to lead the Walk to Defeat ALS Oct. 22.

    "date": "2024-09-07",

    "content": "EDITORIAL: 10-cent paper bag fee should be optional\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 923\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this week, the Easton Town Council debated a proposal to remove a 10-cent fee on paper bags used to bag groceries and other purchased merchandise.We think that fee should be optional — if retailers need to charge the fee to cover the cost of the bags, they should be able to do so. But it is also important that store owners be able to provide the bags at no charge as part of the service they offer customers.\nThe April 2023 Easton ordinance banning the use of plastic bags required retailers to charge customers a fee of at least 10 cents for each paper bag used, encouraging shoppers to bring reusable bags. It came as the Town Council banned the use of plastic bags for packaging purchases in stores such as groceries and retail shops. Restaurants and food establishments are exempt from the ban.\nThis is a hot topic in Eastern Shore communities.\nLate last month, the Commissioners of Oxford debated a similar ban for Oxford before tabling the proposed ordinance.\nLike it does in Easton, Oxford Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said the Oxford ban would apply to retail establishments including grocery stores, convenience stores, shops, department stores and service stations. The ordinance would not apply to restaurants and food service establishments.\nDuring the Oxford public hearing, some business owners and employees expressed concerns with the proposed ordinance. Graham Norbury, the general manager at Safe Harbor Oxford, said that while this may be a national issue, he doesn't observe plastic bags being littered often in Oxford.\n\"Why is restricting a retailer's right to choose the best delivery mechanism for their products, why is that something that the commissioners feel necessary?\" he asked.\nOxford Vintage and Trade owner Barbara Ranson said in her six years of being in business in Oxford, she has always used paper bags. She said she doesn't understand why the commissioners are looking at this legislation when \"it may or may not target three very small businesses.\"\nWe think Oxford should follow in Easton's footsteps and ban plastic bags and even expand the ban to include restaurants and food service establishments.\nPlastic bags have severe and dire affects on the environment.\nNon-biodegradable: Plastic bags can take hundreds of years to break down in the environment. Instead of decomposing, they break into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can persist in the ecosystem for even longer.\nPollution: Plastic bags often end up in waterways and oceans, where they can cause severe pollution. Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic bags, leading to injury or death.\nHarmful chemicals: As plastic bags break down, they can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, which can contaminate ecosystems and pose risks to wildlife and human health.\nEnergy and resources: The production of plastic bags involves the use of fossil fuels and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion.\nWaste management: Plastic bags can be challenging to recycle due to their lightweight and flimsy nature. They can clog machinery at recycling facilities, leading to higher costs and lower recycling rates.\nJust this week a Star Democrat editor watched a plastic grocery bag go airborne from the bed of a pickup truck crossing the Bay Bridge. The bag floated into the air where a breeze caught it and sent it flying over the Bay, eventually landing in the water. That bag became a death trap for a fish or a bird. This is not an isolated incident, we are sure readers can recount similar experiences seeing wayward plastic bags.\nSo we stand firmly behind banning plastic bags and think more towns should follow the lead of Easton and Oxford.\nOur complaint comes with the imposition of a 10-cent fee that Easton requires retailers to charge a fee if a customer requests or needs a plastic bag.\nThere is a good reason for that fee: It provides an incentive for customers to begin using reusable bags, which are far better than even the paper bags.\n\"The reason for the proposal to remove this fee comes directly from the voices of many Easton residents who are feeling its impact,\" said council President Frank Gunsallus in explaining the proposal to make the fee optional, \"especially those in lower-income brackets who are already stretching every dollar to make ends meet.\"\nGunsallus and Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery both said they've talked to residents who do not support the current 10-cent fee. The rest of the council, though, stated otherwise.\n\"I have heard from many people the exact opposite, that the ban is working and that the 10 cents is not onerous in any way, shape or form,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello and Ward 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis stated the fee has incentivized people to bring their own reusable bags. Abbatiello said, \"the reason for that (fee) is because paper bags pollute just as much as plastic bags do.\"\nAll valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Our thought is that this is an issue that should be left to individual retailers to decide what is best for their businesses.\nNearly everybody from the audience who spoke at Tuesday's council meeting supported leaving the mandatory fee in place.\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon held a different stance, questioning why the businesses are forced to charge the 10-cent fee.\n\"I don't know why people are afraid of freedom of choice,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Why don't you let the merchants decide if they want to charge or not, what's wrong with that?\"\nWe agree with Wilcoxon and hope town council members look to making the fee optional when the issue is discussed again on Sept. 16. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the picture Thursday, Sept. 14, to lead a memorial salute to Friedkin, who died in August.He won an Oscar for the fact-inspired 1971 police thriller (named its year's best picture at the awards), as did Gene Hackman as \"Popeye\" Doyle, a tough New York detective determined to get the goods on a seemingly untouchable international drug smuggler (Fernando Rey). Roy Scheider also attained stardom as Doyle's partner, and while there's much else to recommend about the movie, the chase that puts a wild-driving Doyle on the trail of an overload train is a highlight that's hard to beat.

I was like, 'You guys need to go out there and have fun and relax.' Just the things you can say to kids, and nothing tennis related, and it just made them relax.\"\nPinder and Ringold rallied to win, then watched Hayden Legg rally for a clinching victory at No. 3 singles Tuesday, May 7, helping Queen Anne's defeat Stephen Decatur, 4-3, at Washington College for its first Bayside Conference championship in girls tennis.\nWhile the Lions were winning their first title, North Caroline's boys were winning a second straight conference crown, topping James M. Bennett, 4-3, to cap a perfect 15-0 season.\n\"We lost one match last season,\" Bulldogs second-year boys head coach James Donelan said. \"It was their goal to go undefeated this year. And we were able to do that, which was huge.\nWe had a couple of close matches at the end of the season that just took some real grit to pull out and some real mental toughness from our boys,\" Donelan said of a 4-3 win at St. Michaels on April 24 and a 4-3 victory over Easton in the regular-season finale May 1. \"It was really impressive to watch. Their growth and their ability to face adversity, face everybody coming at you, giving you their best every single night and just finding a way to win.\"\nThe Bulldogs did that again against the South champion Clippers.\nNorth Caroline's No. 1 singles team of Josh Huster and Jesse Link defeated Cypress Schnatterly and Joe Chen, 9-7, while Ryan Canter and Hayden Kent beat Bennett's Daniel Ryu and Mason Layne, 8-4, in second doubles. But the Clippers avoided a double sweep, when Shafay Qaiser and Rishi Kandagatla earned an 8-5 win over Gavin O'Brien and Yossin Roblero-Velasquez at No. 3.\nIt remained close, as Bennett's Chen defeated Link, 8-5, at second singles, and Ryu outlasted Canter, 9-7 at No. 3. But Roblero-Velasquez rolled to an 8-1 victory over Landon Blumenthal at No. 4. Huster, who last year teamed with Rebecca White to win the Class 2A state mixed doubles title — North Caroline's first-ever state tennis title of any kind — clinched the victory against Bennett and the perfect record with an 8-3 victory over Schnatterly at No. 1.\n\"Going into this season, after the success that we had last year, we were definitely very confident,\" Donelan said. \"We knew it wasn't going to be handed to us. We knew that everybody was going to be putting a target on our back, and that they knew we only graduated one senior and then all these boys were returning.\"\nUnlike Donelan, Fisher entered the season thinking rebuild after graduating nine seniors from a year ago. Instead, the Lions went unbeaten in the North and 13-1 overall, with the lone loss coming against Decatur.\nAnd while Queen Anne's drew a rematch with the Seahawks for the Bayside championship, Fisher didn't want his team deviating from its usual approach.\n\"Just treat it like a regular match and have fun,\" Fisher said to his team.\nThe Lions' No. 1 doubles team of Lucy Taylor and younger sister Meg Taylor lost 8-6 to Decatur's Ana Pena and Emily Ferguson. But Queen Anne's Hayden Legg and Marylee Kline beat Brooke Berquist and Kalli Nordstrom, 8-2, at No. 2, while Pinder and Ringold erased their 4-1 deficit en route to an 8-6 victory over Anika Karl and Emmie Weber at No. 3.\nThe Seahawks moved to a 3-2 lead, when Pena defeated Lucy Taylor, 8-2 at first singles, and Ferguson earned an 8-2 win over Meg Taylor at No. 2. Kline tied the match at 3-3 with her 8-6 win over Nordstrom at No. 4.\nThat left No. 3 singles, where Karl built a 4-1 lead on Legg. Again Fisher spoke with his player.\n\"I was like, 'Come on Hayden. You can play better,'\" Fisher said. \"'Focus. Take your time.' And basically she just started turning it around.\"\nLegg did turn it around, rallying for an 8-6 title-clinching victory.\n\"I was like, 'It's going to be tough,'\" Fisher said. \"She's like the most chill person. She just kept coming back and coming back.\"\nYet after Legg had completed her comeback to seal the title, nobody from Queen Anne's stormed the court or hoisted their teammate onto their shoulders for a victory lap.\n\"Nobody got excited,\" Fisher said. \"We just all like took it all in, like, 'Good job Hayden.'\" Fisher said. \"I think that's just the mentality of our team. We treat it like a regular match. We just do what we do.\n\"It felt even better because we lost to Decatur during the regular season,\" Fisher said. \"Hey we fixed our wrongs, made some corrections and won it.\"\nWhat Fisher wasn't expecting came next.\n\"They were like, 'Come here coach Fisher and take a picture,'\" Fisher said. \"And then they started spraying me with silly string. It was fun.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In 2023, it saw three.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd, who was sworn in as chief in January of 2023, called the difference progress. He credits the decrease in homicides to a few different things — namely, how the department polices and its partnerships with other agencies.\nOne of the police department's top priorities last year was community-oriented policing. For Todd, that meant being a part of the community that the department services.\nHe said getting out into neighborhoods and creating programs like neighborhood watches can help build relationships and trust in communities and, hopefully, reduce crime.\nAlong with prioritizing community policing, Todd said that the department has tried to be proactive in addressing gun violence and aggressive assaults. He said CPD is now taking an average of one gun off the street each week, \"well more than double\" the average in 2022.\nTodd also stressed the importance of working with other agencies and working with the community. He said that being a part of the Dorchester County Task Force, getting support from Cambridge City Council and focusing on community-oriented policing has all made a difference.\n\"I think a lot of people have come to the table in the last year,\" he said.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said this decrease in the number of homicides in Cambridge is a significant one.\n\"Every shooting that we can stop is a step in the right direction,\" he said.\nRideout said he thinks CPD's community policing efforts are part of the reason for that success.\n\"It's just started, but I think they're building a trust within the community that just did not exist before now,\" he said.\nLieutenant Kyle Clark with Maryland State Police's Homicide Unit said that although he can't say for certain why the number of homicides has gone down in Cambridge, he can say that there has been a focus on collaboration between agencies.\n\"We do concentrate on a lot of collaborative efforts with other units within the State Police and also allied agencies,\" he said, specifying the use of task forces, gang units and gun units. \"And those are all tools that we use to combat the crime in any city.\"\nClark said that he would estimate about 50% of the homicides in the last two years in Cambridge have been gang-related. He said that in addressing gang violence, MSP, along with other agencies at all levels, do \"everything and anything\" to combat the gang violence.\nTodd said CPD is working to identify gang members and groups that are \"constantly harassing\" residents in different Cambridge neighborhoods. He said they have worked with the different agencies within the Dorchester County Task Force as well as federal agencies to identify who is bringing in handguns and where they are coming from.\n\"The partnership's been great with the Task Force and Maryland State Police,\" he said. \"The Homicide Unit with Maryland State Police — they handle all of our homicides. So we work hand in hand together. And that's what it's going to take.\"\nTodd said he has noticed gun violence and homicide rates begin to fall throughout the country.\nSpecific data on other crime rates in Cambridge should be released to the public in the next couple of weeks, Todd said.\nRideout said early intervention is important when it comes to crime prevention. Rideout was recently at a meeting about a flag football initiative by CPD and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.\n\"It was really an exciting possibility of where we can really start focusing, not only on the crime itself, but on the prevention and early intervention,\" he said.\nRideout added that engaging children in education and outside activities, such as programming at the YMCA or Boys and Girls Club, can have a positive effect.\nGoing into 2024, CPD's goals include continuing to build its manpower, focusing on data-driven technology and \"patrolling with a purpose.\"\nTodd said \"patrolling with a purpose\" means putting officers in the areas where crimes are occurring on the specific days and at the specific times they have been occurring.\nHe said that residents can also expect to see more data from CPD in the new year, including heat maps of where crimes are occurring.\nRegarding homicides, Rideout said the downward trend is good, but added that the work doesn't stop here.\n\"What we have to do is continue working on it and engage the community in working on it to hopefully keep these numbers down,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cat was turned into the Humane Society, which then contacted the Caroline County Health Department's Environmental Health Division to facilitate rabies testing.Any person in the vicinity of Legion Road should avoid contact with wildlife, feral cats, unknown animals and any animal (including cats or dogs) that appears sick or to exhibit signs of rabies. Additionally, all residents in the area are urged to make sure their pets and mammal livestock are up to date on rabies vaccinations.\nTo report a potentially rabid animal, contact Animal Control at (410) 820-1600 or the non-emergency line of the 911 Center at (410) 479-2222.\nPlease contact the Caroline County Health Department immediately if you have had, or may know of anyone who might have had, any possible human or animal exposure to a rabid animal at (410) 479-8045.\nIf you have an emergency regarding a potential rabid animal or exposure and are calling after normal business hours or on the weekend, call (410) 829-5910.\nAn exposure can mean contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes or scratches by potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal.\nAdditionally, any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure. All bites, regardless of body site, represent a potential risk of rabies transmission, but that risk varies with the species of biting animal, the site of the bite and the severity of the wound.\nRabies is a serious, but preventable viral disease that attacks the nervous system. It is predominantly seen in raccoons, bats and skunks, as well as dogs and cats.\nAll wild or unknown animals must be avoided whenever possible since the possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere and anytime.\nPet owners should remember that the best way to protect themselves, their families and their pets is to keep their animals up to date on rabies vaccination.\nThe Health Department regularly offers low-cost rabies clinics to help residents protect their pets. The next clinic will be held in the spring. Please monitor the Health Department's Events Calendar for more information.\nFor more information about rabies, visit CDC's Rabies Prevention webpage at cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mixed-use residential development planned in Easton\n\n June 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Two mixed-use developments will be built on the former Perdue grain facility on Brookletts Avenue. These developments will provide affordable housing opportunities and commercial use for the town of Easton, developers said.The project's developers are Chesapeake Community Development, a subsidiary of The Arc focused on creating equitable, accessible and inclusive committees.\nJonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, said the project will be a thriving neighborhood that will support the various housing needs of the community by offering quality affordable and market-rate rentals.\n\"When you look at a six-and-a-half-acre site, there's a real opportunity to think more broadly, but also to say, 'how do you really affect the community rather than just building something that's part of the community?'\" Rondeau said. \"But how can it be a foundation of the community?\"\nThe Arc is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nAbout 15 years ago, The Arc decided to create housing opportunities for people with disabilities, which is how Chesapeake Community Development and Chesapeake Neighbors were created.\nThough the focus was to establish affordable housing for people with disabilities, the need for affordable housing became so essential that the organization changed its mission to create affordable housing opportunities for all.\nRondeau said they manage about 70 units in Anne Arundel County and the Eastern Shore, including the Primrose and Port Streets Commons. The Arc's subsidiaries seek to create opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access services.\nRondeau said mixing affordable and market-rate housing makes development financially viable by allowing subsidies for affordable units through market-rate rents.\nHe said though Talbot County has a high median income, there are a lot of families that live significantly below the average income. Rondeau said that there is a range of people who have a full time job but make less than $30,000 a year.\nworkers like baristas and education professionals are people who do important work in the community and should be given the access to live in the area as well, Rondeau said.\nRoss Benincasa, a consulting partner and vice president of community development, said the need for affordable housing was great in the area.\n\"Our vision is to bring a vibrant multi-purpose space to the community that incorporates a wide range of amenities and resources, including much-needed housing,\" Benincasa said in a press release earlier this month.\nRondeau said they will be hosting a community meeting at the Brookletts Place Senior Center on July 10 at 5 p.m. to hear the concerns and ideas from the local community. He emphasized that community involvement is crucial to addressing any concerns and helping design a development that can meet the people's needs.\n\"We, The Arc and Chesapeake Neighbors and Chesapeake Community Development want to be part of the community and be part of making Easton an inclusive and equitable community,\" Rondeau said. \"And projects like this allow us to do that, and we hope that the community can help be part of that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fall is for digging up sweet potatoes\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mabel Savage | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 1514\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sweet potatoes are a classic fall favorite that requires a lot of work if you grow your own.We did back in the day on the farm. Each year there would be certain foods that were harvested for the coming winter months - white potatoes, turnips, corn and sweet potatoes.It took most of the family to help harvest these crops.A couple of days in advance, the baskets were prepared for digging day.The older brothers set aside the day to help my dad and the younger brothers.We cleaned and made space in the storage shed to place the sweet potatoes.They were sorted in baskets according to size. Usually digging day was on Saturday, when everyone was off work and out of school.A few days later, mom would wash some of the larger ones and cook them in large pots of boiling water until tender, then drain off water and cool enough to remove the skins and snip off ends.They were then placed in freezer bags and frozen for later use.Not only do sweet potatoes taste great they provide many health benefits.When eating sweet potatoes do not remove the skins, as they contain antioxidants including vitamin A and beta-carotene. They also have sporamin.Eating sweet potatoes is great to help manage your blood sugar levels, improve your immune system strength, improve your vision and help eliminate bacteria in the intestines.Let's get exploring some great sweet potato recipes.SWEET POTATO BISCUITS1 cup sweet potato cooked, mashed, and cooled,¼ cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg beaten, 1 tbsp butter melted, 1 cup milk, 3 cups self-rising flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon nutmeg,½ cup shortening.Start by combining sweet potato, sugar, egg and melted butter. Beat with a fork until smooth then stir in milk. Set mixture aside.Stir together self-rising flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Cut in shortening until it resembles coarse crumbs.Make a well in the center of the dry mixture. Add spiced sweet-potato mixture and stir just until combined. Turn out the biscuit mixture onto a well-floured surface. Knead gently for 10 to 12 strokes.Don't overdo it. Pat dough to about 1/2-inch thickness.Cut with a floured 2-1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits 1 inch apart on a large baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the biscuits are lightly browned.SWEET POTATO FLUFF3 cups sweet potatoes cooked and mashed, 2 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup orange juice, or milk, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/3 cup marshmallow creme, or fluff, 1 large well beaten egg, 1 cup miniature marshmallows. Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Combine sweet potatoes, butter, orange juice or milk, salt, and 1/3 cup of marshmallow creme. Beat in egg. Pile sweet potatoes in a lightly buttered baking dish.Bake for 25 minutes. Top with miniature marshmallows and brown under broiler for about 4 minutes.CANDIED SWEET POTATOES4 to 5 large sweet potatoes, about 8 to 10 cups peeled and cubed, 2 tablespoons orange zest, from 1 orange, 1/4 cup orange juice, from 1 orange, 1 cup light brown sugar, packed, 1/4 cup honey, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, nutmeg. Gather the ingredients. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Lightly grease the slow cooker crock.Arrange the sweet potato cubes in the slow cooker.Use a zester or grater to get the zest from 1 orange, then squeeze the orange to get its juice. In a small bowl, combine the orange zest, orange juice, brown sugar, honey, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Heat the mixture in the microwave or on the stovetop in a saucepan.Stir to blend and pour the mixture over the sweet potato cubes. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours, until the sweet potatoes are tender.OLD FASHIONED BAKED SWEET POTATOES4 medium sweet potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 tablespoons butter, Kosher salt, Freshly ground black pepper, cinnamon sugar. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a baking pan with foil. Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly, dry, and prick each one in several places with a fork to aerate. Rub oil all over each potato. Arrange potatoes on foil and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until they are fork tender. Cut a 1 1/2-inch \"X\" in the center of each baked sweet potato. Using a clean dish rag or potholder to protect your hands, hold a potato on each side and press upward until filling \"bursts\" up through cuts.Top with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Season with paprika or a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Wash and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly. This will help the skin to crisp up well during baking.CROCK POT CARAMEL GLAZED SWEET POTATOES2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for buttering slow cooker4 to 6 medium sweet potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds, peeled and sliced, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup brown sugar, packed, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 teaspoon cinnamon.Lightly butter the inner sides and bottom of the slow cooker. Add sliced sweet potatoes and sprinkle with salt. Combine sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over the sweet potatoes. Cut butter into small ¼ cubes and drop into the crock pot. Cover and cook on low for 7 to 9 hours.Here is a non-traditional recipe that my son John makes with sweet potatoes.ITALIAN SWEET POTATOES4 medium sweet potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, 1 cup chopped red bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 clove garlic minced, 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup Italian cheese blend, Italian parsley, chopped. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scrub the sweet potatoes thoroughly, dry, and prick each one in several places with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Rub olive oil all over each potato. Arrange the potatoes on the foillined baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until they are fork-tender. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble the sausage into the skillet and cook until the sausage begins to brown. Add the red pepper, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt to the skillet.Stir and cook until the vegetables are soft. Place the Italian sausage and vegetable mixture in a large bowl.Cut each baked sweet potato in half and scoop out most of the inside, leaving the potato skin shell fully intact. Add the scooped sweet potato to the bowl with the Italian sausage and vegetables. Stir to combine. Spoon the sweet potato and sausage mixture back into baked potato skins.Top with cheese and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until the cheese is browned on top and potato skins start to crisp. Top with parsley and serve.SWEET POTATO PIE2 cups Cooked Mashed Sweet Potatoes, 1.25 cups Granulated Sugar, 1/4 cup Butter, melted, 2 Eggs, 1 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract, 1/4 tsp Salt, 1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp Ground Ginger, 1 cup Evaporated Milk, 9\" Frozen Pie Shell.Preheat the oven to 350°F.In a mixing bowl combine the sweet potatoes, sugar, melted butter, eggs, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and ginger.Mix together with a hand mixer until well combined.Add the evaporated milk and mix to combine. Add the pie filling mixture to the pie crust and place into the oven.Bake for 45 minutes or until done. Center of the pie should be set when done. Allow to cool before serving. Top with whipped cream, if desired.OVEN BAKED SWEET POTATO FRIES2 pounds orange fleshed sweet potatoes (about 3 large) 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 to 2 tablespoons spice or spice combination of your choice: chipotle powder, pumpkin pie spice. For more crispiness, preheat your oven to 500°F.Place a roasting pan or heavy duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.Peel the sweet potatoes and cut off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Alternatively, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks either with a mandoline or a sharp knife. Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well to combine.Sprinkle them with salt and spices of your choice.Use your hands to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices. Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces. Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are well browned.Cooking time depends on the temperature of the oven (500°F will need less cooking time than 450°F) and the size and thinness of the sweet potato wedges. The browner they are, the crispier they will be, but there is a fine line between browned and burnt beyond edibility.Even if they get really dark, they should still be good because of the natural sugars of the sweet potatoes caramelizing. \n \n Caption: METR O CREAT IVE SERVICES\n \nMabel Savage's oven baked sweet potato fries can be spiced a variety of different ways. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Museum creates immersive Harriet Tubman experience\n\n October 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 476\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center closed in May due to water damage. Since then, the museum has secured a grant that has allowed them to renovate the facility.Tuesday there was an open house for residents to see the progress and vision for the museum's reopening. Director of Programming and Events Linda Harris said the museum will be an immersive and interactive experience that follows Tubman's journey from slavery in Maryland to freedom in Pennsylvania.\nThe museum walls will depict different scenes of Tubman's life, integrated with lighting, sound, music and narrated walkthroughs to attract a young audience and evoke spirituality and community.\n\"I think it's something divine. Being connected to this story, marvelous things happen,\" Harris said. \"We had a flood in May. Lots of water damage, and it took us until about three weeks ago to get the insurance company to pony up.\"\nThough they received a check from the insurance company, it wasn't enough to cover the renovations. But as Harris said they received a large anonymous donation that made this dream come true.\nHarris' daughter-in-law Erica Carson-Harris is an interior architect and is leading the museum's renovations. Artist Michael Rosato, who painted the \"Walk With Me\" mural — which can be found on the wall outside of the museum — is doing the paintings on the walls and floors.\n\"We're painting a path on the floor and certain areas lead to a certain part of the wall, that's gonna tell her story. So there will be a story of her standing out in the marsh, looking at the shooting stars having revelations, to a story about where she was enslaved, the cabin and the fields outside of that, to meeting Frederick Douglass, to leading the troops at the Combahee River, and then through the end in Philadelphia,\" Rosato said.\nFor Carson-Harris, she hopes the museum will create an emotional connection that provides knowledge about Tubman. Both Carson-Harris and Rosato want to encourage the public to come and visit during the renovations to see the work they're doing and if they feel called, to leave a donation.\n\"With Linda opening it up for people to see this, I encourage people to come and visit, as we're in the midst of this transition. You know, definitely just come out and look at the transition. Be a part of the journey as well,\" Carson-Harris said.\nHarris plans to create the exhibit as a virtual reality experience where those who don't have the opportunity to see it in person, can experience it firsthand online.\nThere is still no projected date for the re-opening, but Carson-Harris is hopeful it could happen within six months. She encourages residents to donate to the museum that runs solely on donations.\n\"My mantra is find the Harriet in you,\" Harris said. \"To all of us love, community, passion, resilience, courage. Embrace those things, and we got this.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Commissioner Roche brings up CWDI lawsuit, hopes city will withdraw it\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — As the open session of the Cambridge City Council meeting on May 13 came near a close, tensions rose.Minutes before entering closed session, Commissioner Brian Roche brought up the City Council's pending lawsuit against Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. The lawsuit, filed May 1 against CWDI, CWDI Holdings and Yacht Maintenance Company, alleges CWDI is in violation of a transfer agreement it entered into with the city in June 2021.\nIt seeks $75,000 in damages and requests temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping defendants from transferring any portion of the property in violation of the covenants of the 2021 transfer agreement with the city.\nIn the meeting, Roche said he hoped the city could withdraw the lawsuit because it could be jeopardizing a critical aspect of CWDI's Cambridge Harbor project, which is a project to develop the space along the Cambridge waterfront that includes a promenade, parks and a boutique hotel with a restaurant and bar.\nRoche talked about the project plans for public spaces — including an expanded public promenade and tree park — and a working waterfront. He said that these parts of the project are things that the community has said it wants and that a lot of it can't or won't happen while the litigation is pending.\nHe said the $2.4 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to expand the promenade cannot be pursued because of the city's lawsuit.\n\"I understand the issues the city has with this development, and I'm not discounting them,\" Roche said, adding that his understanding is that the project should be looked at in two phases: one being the public parts of the project and two being the developable parts of the project.\nAccording to a community update event CWDI hosted in April, the first phase of the project would include the creation of a boutique hotel, the expansion of Yacht Maintenance and a partnership with Richardson Maritime Museum. The second phase of the project would include the creation of residential units and retail spaces, seven acres of open public spaces and parking.\nAs Roche talked about the phases of the project, Atkiss interrupted to ask, \"Do you want to have CWDI come and do a presentation on the calendar for this?\"\nRoche said he was sorry and his point is that there are two phases.\n\"If the city wanted to actually encumber and really come to the table, we could have waited until they —\"\n\"We did ask them to come to the table,\" Atkiss said, cutting Roche off. \"I was in that meeting. I know you have a different outcome from what happened at that meeting, but I was there. And we did come to the table and we did ask them to work with us.\"\nAtkiss said CWDI did not work with them, and that is why the city is now in this position.\n\"Just to be perfectly clear,\" she said. \"Because a lot of what you're staying is not really factual.\"\nThe lawsuit is one piece in a series of actions the city has taken regarding its concerns with the Cambridge Harbor project. In October, the city wrote a letter to CWDI expressing concerns with the project. On March 18, former City Manager Tom Carroll submitted his resignation and said he was resigning over concerns with the project. April 16, Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout held a meeting where he proposed amendments to CWDI's Articles of Incorporation.\nRoche said that withdrawing the lawsuit could allow the city to \"come back to the table\" to see if the CWDI Board of Directors is willing to dive into \"the real concerns\" including tax increment financing, requests for proposals, the YMCA and other issues.\nAs Roche listed these concerns, Atkiss added a few to the list: \"property transfer, covenants,\" she said.\nRoche said another concern is whether the lawsuit could affect the search for the city's next city manager.\n\"Are we actually risking our possibility of attracting a good candidate with being subject to what could be a very prolonged and intractable legal situation?\" he asked.\nAt the end of his comments, Roche said this was something he had to bring up and apologized to Atkiss for upsetting her. When Rideout gave Atkiss an opportunity to respond to Roche's comments, Atkiss said she would pass. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black watermen’s monument proposed for Wells Cove\n\n September 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The Queen Anne's County Commissioners approved Wells Cove as the site for a proposed Black watermen's monument Aug. 26, further representing the history and legacy of the county's iconic industry.Tilghman Hemsley, a Queenstown artist and director of American Patriotic Monuments Inc., who created the original Kent Narrows watermen's monument 20 years ago, said he had been approached about the lack of Black representation in that project.\nSeeking commissioner approval to establish the new monument on county property at Wells Cove, Hemsley presented mock-ups of the detailed sculptures.\nSymbolizing the rich heritage of Black watermen, the monument will depict life-size bronze sculptures featuring a conversation between a head boat captain and an oyster boat worker, according to Hemsley. The piece will also feature other important aspects of the industry, including a man working with clams, a woman picking crabs, another cleaning fish, as well as a young boy with a fishing pole along for the experience.\n\"It's a sculpture that leans into the whole industry,\" Hemsley said.\n\"The piece is designed for the public to be able to come through and be part of the sculpture,\" he said.\nWith the history of the Black watermen engraved into the side of the pieces, \"it's all about education,\" he said.\nThe monument is slated for a location between Bridges Restaurant and the Jetty restaurant. Hemsley emphasized the interactive nature of the work, allowing visitors the opportunity to pass between the pieces and engage with the sculptures as they visit the local area.\nThe watermen will be life-size bronze sculptures while the boat pieces will be stainless steel and powder-coated, he said.\nHemsley said the design of the pieces should make the monument low maintenance.\nThe project has already received approval from the Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation Department and a letter of recommendation from the Kent Narrows Foundation, he said.\nThe commissioners unanimously approved Wells Cove as the site for the proposed monument. Commissioner Jim Moran noted he would have preferred a competition among artists to design a tribute to Black watermen but supported the plan.\nHemsley noted time is of the essence if the statue is to be ready by July 4, 2026, in celebration of the country's 250th anniversary.\nServing as director of the project, Hemsley said various other artists will be involved in the sculpture work. The proposed monument has an advisory committee that includes watermen, he said.\nWith commissioner approval, the next steps include seeking funding grants, according to Hemsley.\nAlthough highly appreciated, just like the original watermen's monument, the project would not be solely dependent on county support, he said.\nThe total cost for the project is estimated at about $475,000. The previous watermen's monument cost about $300,000, he said.\nStatues typically take about three years to complete, but Hemsley was confident as long as funding came through.\n\"It's aggressive, but we can do it,\" he said.\nA fundraising event with auctions, games and music will be held at the Kent Island American Legion Nov. 8 starting at 7 p.m., he said.\nHemsley is also working with the Centreville Veterans Information Committee to create a life-size statue honoring the more than 400 Black soldiers of Queen Anne's County who fought for the Union during the Civil War.\nWorking with Chesapeake Charities, the veteran statue committee has been hard at work establishing itself as a nonprofit, according to John Wright, statue committee chair.\nWright credited the enthusiasm of the committee in working to establish a historic monument.\n\"I'm glad I am in a position to help,\" he said.\nWith the sculpture to be completed in stages, the committee foresees about a year and a half before a statue stands in front of the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center.\nDonations can be sent to United States Colored Troops Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 42, Centreville, MD 21617.\nAs a Maryland nonprofit, American Patriotic Monuments Inc. seeks to lead public arts projects and monuments that celebrate American legacies.\nMore information, including sponsorship opportunities, can be found at apmiart.org.\nInformation about Hemsley's work can be found at tilghmanhemsleyfinearts.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan will run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.Hogan, a Republican, announced his campaign on Friday via social media, releasing a video just nine hours before Maryland's candidacy deadline and surprising a lot of political observers.\n\"Fifty years ago, my father, Maryland congressman Larry Hogan Sr., made a very tough decision. He became the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon,\" Hogan said. \"He put aside party politics and his own personal considerations, and he stepped up to do the right thing for Maryland and the nation.\"\n\"Today, Washington is completely broken, because that kind of leadership, that kind of willingness to put country over party, has become far too rare,\" Hogan added.\nHogan joins the list of 20 candidates fighting for outgoing Sen. Ben Cardin's seat. Cardin, a Democrat, announced in May his plan to retire at the end of his current term.\nNotable Senate candidates include Democrats Angela Alsobrooks, Prince George's County executive, and Rep. David Trone, as well as Republicans Robin Ficker, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates and a perennial candidate for various offices, and John Teichert, a retired Air Force brigadier general.\n\"The beauty of living in this great republic that I fought to defend for over three decades is that we give Americans a choice about who represents us in elected public office,\" Teichert said in a statement released Friday. \"Marylanders deserve to have a choice and I welcome anyone to the race who wants to offer them one.\"\nIf elected, Hogan would become Maryland's first Republican senator since Charles Mathias, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1987.\n\"He's the only Republican in the state who stands a chance,\" Todd Eberly, associate professor of political science and public policy at St. Mary's College of Maryland, told Capital News Service.\n\"His chances depend on a couple of factors,\" said John Dedie, political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County. \"First, if the Trone, Alsobrooks primary gets contested with nastiness and they can't make peace after the primary… that could help Hogan because maybe one side stays home and doesn't vote.\"\nAccording to Dedie, Hogan will have to focus on his accomplishments during his two terms as governor and his work with the Democrats. He may have to criticize Republicans, but then some of those voters may stay home, Dedie said.\nTrone said in a statement that Hogan's bid is an attempt to boost the agenda of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and former President Donald Trump.\n\"Larry Hogan's candidacy is nothing but a desperate attempt to return Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to power and give them the deciding vote to ban abortion nationwide, suppress votes across the country, and give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,\" Trone said in a statement.\nHogan has always said that he is pro-life, according to Dedie. On this year's ballot, Maryland voters will see a \"measure of basically codified abortion rights into the state constitution,\" which will affect Hogan's campaign, Dedie said.\nCardin believes that the Republican nominee for Senate will be in a tough battle against Democratic candidates Alsobrooks and Trone for the seat.\n\"Regardless of who is the Republican nominee, I am confident that Marylanders will keep our state in the blue column this November, holding the Senate as a bulwark against a dysfunctional and chaotic House of Representatives,\" Cardin said in a statement.\nAccording to Bloomberg, McConnell recruited Hogan.\n\"This is the best one in the sense that we are now competitive in a state nobody thought we could win. He's a proven winner,\" McConnell told Bloomberg.\nMaryland's primary election is May 14, giving Hogan just three months to campaign.\nSabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics slightly changed its rating for the Maryland Senate race after Hogan's announcement from \"Safe Democratic\" to \"Likely Democratic,\" a reflection of the former governor's immediate impact on the contest.\nIn Annapolis, one Republican lawmaker said he wouldn't count Hogan out.\n\"I certainly believe that Governor Hogan feels that he has a path to victory, or else he would not get into the race,\" said State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's ). \"He certainly has a chance. He's proven that he can win in Maryland, on a statewide basis … He has found a way to map that out and believes that he can be successful.\"\nBut another fellow Republican asserted that running on the ticket with Trump would be no easy task for Hogan.\nHouse Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told CNS that Hogan's announcement took him by surprise.\n\"It's going to be an uphill climb,\" Buckel said. \"He'll have to navigate being on the ticket with Donald Trump … and it will be a challenge for him.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge shares progress on Douglas Street houses\n\n March 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 592\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Those walking down Douglas Street this summer might see new homeowners sitting on spacious porches, looking out onto Cornish Park as kids run around and play.A city project to build four homes on Douglas Street in Cambridge's historic Pine Street neighborhood has been underway since September. Cambridge Housing Program Manager Ed Crosby said the city expects construction on all four houses to be complete by June 30.\nThese custom houses will be energy efficient and have features that make them feel like home, from oak staircases to crown molding.\n\"We wanted folks to take a sense of pride,\" Crosby said.\nThis project is one way the city is improving its housing stock, uplifting the community and fostering a culture where residents want to stay in Cambridge.\nThe houses on Douglas Street will be sold at 80% of area median income to people who qualify based on income and standards by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Crosby said prospective buyers will have to complete homebuyer education training.\nThree of the four homes getting built on Douglas Street will have three bedrooms. The fourth home will have four bedrooms and follow accessibility guidelines from the Americans with Disabilities Act, including having a ramp.\nIn all of the houses, features include electric fireplaces and washer and dryer units. Each house will have backyard space with a shed.\nCrosby said the homes will be listed in the low $200,000s, with the most expensive home possibly reaching $250,000 in price. In February, the median selling price for homes in Cambridge was $276,000, according to Realtor.com.\nOn March 4, those working on the houses were putting up drywall. Gregory Beard, the general contractor for the project, said the next steps will be painting, putting in flooring, installing trim and bringing in subcontractors to install fixtures, hardware and plumbing.\n\"Things are coming together great,\" Beard said. \"Fantastic build. It's a fun project.\"\nCrosby hopes the city will have the property listed online this month.\n\"There's an excitement brewing that we're just ready to move forward with this,\" he said.\nAlthough the properties could be purchased by people who don't live in Cambridge, Crosby said the city has made an \"intentional effort\" to market the homes to city residents before listing them. He said there are at least 30 Cambridge residents who have shown interest in the homes and have applied to buy one.\nIn late February, the city gave tours to show the construction progress to the Cambridge City Council and the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. Crosby said the tours gave attendees an opportunity to learn more about the project from the developer, architect, engineers and contractors.\nDuring the tours, some commissioners gave the city ideas on how to ensure the homes are not flipped or purchased by landlords to turn into rentals, Crosby said.\n\"You can actually write that into the deed where there's a requirement that the city could get what is called the right of first sale,\" he said. \"So if it comes to a point and the homeowner's interested in selling, the city would have the opportunity to actually purchase the property back and then keep it under that 80% of AMI program so that we can continue to have it available as affordable housing.\"\nAfter the city finishes building the Douglas Street houses, it plans to build at least 10 more homes on Chesapeake Court and School House Lane. Crosby said this project will help inform the city on how to go about building more houses.\n\"And from this blueprint, we'll learn how the next set of homes will be,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton man receives 18 years for sex assault of daughter, other crimes\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An Easton man received an 18-year sentence on Thursday for third-degree sex offense against his then-3-year-old daughter, among other offenses.Kevin Manning, 34, appeared in court to hear his fate after entering a guilty plea for the felony sex offense and nine other counts, including witness intimidation, electronic communication harassment and violation of a protective order. Those nine counts were levied for actions he took against his daughter's mother after the Sept. 2024 assault of the daughter.\nTalbot County Circuit Court Judge Phil Cronan handed down the 18-year sentence — a term exceeding the recommended five- to 13-year range — for what he called a \"vicious and heinous\" crime.\nBefore Cronan delivered the sentence, Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel asked the court for a 30-year sentence.\nEndzel cited Manning's past sex assault convictions: a fourth-degree sex offense in Anne Arundel County in 2016 and second-degree rape in Talbot County in 2022 stemming from a 2009 incident involving Manning and an underage female living with him at the time.\nThe rape conviction was dismissed in 2023 after it was determined that the judge who postponed Manning's trial date was not designated to do so.\nEndzel argued for the extended sentence, in part, due to Manning's \"repeated harassment\" of the child's mother, Emily Hiester, beginning last September. Endzel wrote in a memo to the court that Manning contacted Hiester nearly 200 times through emails and phone calls, violating a protective order.\nEndzel read a written impact statement from Hiester, in which the mother said she couldn't bear to be in a courtroom with Manning. Hiester wrote that she has secluded herself from others and that she \"can see the pain\" in her daughter's eyes.\n\"I can't see others the same when someone I thought I knew I could trust did something so horrible,\" a portion of the statement read.\nHiester asked for Manning's sentence to be \"as much time as the court will allow.\"\nEndzel also argued that an open District Court case in which Manning is accused of assaulting an inmate at the Talbot County Detention Center factors into the danger he poses to society. The alleged assault occurred May 24.\n\"The question is not whether he will reoffend, but when,\" Endzel said.\nManning's defense attorney, Holly Brownley of the public defender's office, asked Cronan to deliver a sentence within the pre-sentence recommendations.\nManning \"had some serious traumas in his young life,\" such as the murder of his mother and being exposed to drug and substance abuse, Brownley said.\nThe 34-year-old defendant, in an orange suit, handcuffs and wide black glasses, spoke for a few minutes at the hearing Thursday. He said he wants to go to a maximum-security prison, Patuxent Institution in Jessup, to receive treatment.\nManning acknowledged his daughter was the victim and said what occurred was an accident. He disagreed with Endzel's claims that he has shown no remorse.\n\"To ostracize me from society, I don't believe's appropriate,\" Manning said, noting that since 2019, he doesn't feel he's been a \"trouble or menace\" to society.\nCronan disagreed with that assessment.\nThe judge said Manning's behavior has escalated the last 15 years. The dismissed rape conviction is \"certainly something ... in this court's mind,\" Cronan said. He added that the sex offense conviction and a related burglary crime from 2016 as well as the pending assault case from two months ago played a role.\n\"That doesn't sound to me that you haven't been any trouble,\" Cronan told Manning. \"Quite the opposite.\"\nThe judge said the facts of the case were clear: Manning assaulted his daughter and \"manipulated the mother of your child\" to try to get her to lie in court for him.\nCronan said the daughter \"should have the comfort\" to be with her father without such a thing happening.\nIn addition to the 18 years, Manning is ordered to be on probation for five years after his release, make no contact with Hiester or the daughter and not visit their residences, schools, places of employment or daycares. He will register as a Tier III sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

There was food and drink, nature and art all combining to create a perfect fall day.\"We had almost 250 attendees and 55 artists,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director of Adkins Arboretum.\nThere was lots of food and drink.\n\"Ten Eyck provided mimosas and bloody Marys, and Craft Bakery and Night Kitchen provided great food and drinks including pastries and lunch items,\" Tiernan said. \"Diane Mullaly got us started and is our advisor on this event, and she won first prize,\" she said.\nMullaly learned a lot about running a Plein Air quick contest from her time at the Plein Air Easton.\n\"I brought Ginna the idea about four years ago about creating an event like this. I created sort of a slower version of the quick draw. The painters started at 10 and ended at 12:30. A half hour longer than Plein Air Easton. Quite a few sold,\" Mullaly said.\nFor Mullaly the passion goes deeper than her creativity.\n\"I am deeply involved with the arboretum. I am a Maryland master naturalist and a trained docent there. I am there a lot and I just adore that place. I always feel so good when I am there. It is very healing and relaxing. Being able to paint there in that beautiful environment is such a treat,\" Mullaly said.\nBeth Bathe was the judge and was generous with her time with all artists.\nBathe said, \"Judging the works of over 50 artists this past Saturday at Adkins Aboretum was a true honor as each painting vividly showcased the rich colors and textures of the autumn season. Live music, wonderful food and drink and beautiful artwork all for sale made a great day for the artists and the community.\"\nThere were collectors who have also attended the Plein Air Easton event. They came to see and purchase more great art.\nThe winners were Mullaly, second place winner Abby Ober and third place winner Maryellyn Lynott.\nThere were honorable mentions too. These included Lori Yates, Lynn Lewis, Ronaldo Dorado, Stephen Walker and Sheryl Southwick.\nThere was a tie for Artist's Choice — Nancy Fine and Toni Wolf.\nEvent Sponsors included Caroline County Council for the Arts, Maryland State Arts Council, Enel and Unity Landscape Design/Build. Live music was provided by Fine Times.\nAlthough the Arboretum got a 20% commission of any art that sold, the main benefit was attracting lots of people to spend time in nature. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wiedefeld and representatives from various state agencies.State Highway Administrator William Pines spoke about his agency's efforts to improve infrastructure and safety at several high-traffic locations within Talbot County.The agency initiated a $1.5 million study of Route 328 to assess safety and capacity improvements along a 1.6-mile stretch between U.S. Route 50 and Black Dog Alley. Delays are seen in this area from turning vehicles and queueing at signalized intersections, and there are limited pedestrian and bicycle facilities, Pines said.A public meeting on the Route 328 project is tentatively scheduled for this winter.Other transportation improvements within Easton include a $600,000 project for new lighting at the intersection of Route 50 and Route 322 (Easton Bypass) to improve visibility and safety, signal improvements and pedestrian upgrades - including a Rails to Trails link - at Route 322 and Glenwood Avenue, and a new signal at Route 50 and Chapel Road that will be activated by the end of November.In 2024, SHA will begin construction on two additional projects: reconstructing the signal at Route 50 and Route 309 and upgrading the flashing signal at Route 331 and Black Dog Alley to a full signal.Two local trail projects are also receiving federal and state grant funding, Pines said.$48,000 will go toward the final design of a 1.25-mile extension of the St. Michaels Nature and Bike Trail, and $30,000 will go toward the study and preliminary design of a rail trail connecting parks in Oxford.Turning to public transit, nearly $1.1 million in operating and capital grants are being allocated to support Delmarva Community Transit.$225,000 of this will fund preventative maintenance and two new small buses, said Travis Johnston, the Maryland Transit Administration's local transit support director.Delmarva Community Services will also receive $123,000 to install a propane filling station for future propane-powered vehicles, enabling DCS to transition to a low-emission fleet.Additionally, $24,000 in highway safety grants were awarded to the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the Easton Police Department.Turning to the skies, the Easton Airport's runway improvement program is receiving $525,000 from the Maryland Aviation Administration to support the initial phase of construction.THINKING DOWN THE ROADLocal officials also weighed in on a number of priorities and problem areas they hope the transportation agency will address in the future.Discussions on traffic surrounding the proposed new regional medical center site off of Route 50 were top priorities for state legislators, the county and the Town of Easton. Rick Van Emburgh, Easton's town engineer, said he wanted to work with the county and the state on a regional traffic plan to handle the impact on local roads and infrastructure.Cheryl Lewis, Oxford's town manager, raised questions on the agency's response to flooding on the causeway and pedestrian safety in a town with few sidewalks.Queen Anne Mayor Philip Starkey asked if the agency would reevaluate fixing the bridge between the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro, which floods every time it rains, he said.Accessibility was raised as an issue in St. Michaels. According to Town Administrator Rob Straebel, all but one of the town's ADA ramps are not in compliance due to poor work from a contractor.\"I'm not sure what the way forward is, and I'm not here to point fingers or to blame anyone or to place culpability on anyone,\" he said. \"But there really needs to be a sense of urgency to get this project rectified as soon as possible before our tourist season starts in the summer of 2024.\" Pines said the state was working to develop an \"aggressive schedule\" to get the project over the finish line.Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-37) further emphasized the need to fix the ramps, noting that Route 33, as the main road running through St. Michaels, doesn't just serve town residents, but residents of Claiborne, McDaniel, Sherwood and Tilghman.Several Royal Oak residents in attendance also raised concerns about the width and safety of Route 329 (Royal Oak Road), asking the transportation officials to lower the speed limit.\"I wish I could do everything that everyone asked immediately, but we will keep chipping away,\" Wiedefeld said, closing out the meeting. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nState transportation officials take turns sharing updates from their respective agencies on Talbot County projects during a meeting Tuesday, Nov. 7. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dorchester. The ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat shortly after midnight, just 90 miles short of its destination.\nAboard were four chaplains, George L. Fox, Alexander D. Goode, Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington, who gave up their life jackets to save the lives of four servicemen.\n\"They didn't have life jackets when they went down with the ship,\" American Legion Post Cmdr. Wayne Hall said to those gathered Sunday. \"The story goes that they were all holding hands and singing hymns when the ship went down.\"\nDuring the service, the four chaplains were represented by local religious leaders — Rabbi Peter Hyman of Temple B'nai Israel, the Rev. Jonathon Moyers of Grace Lutheran, the Rev. Gary L. Moore of the Trappe Faith Chapel United Methodist Church and the Rev. Michael Angeloni of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church.\nThe JROTC from Easton High School presented the colors.\nAfter the color guard cleared, the four religious leaders took turns coming to a lectern up in front of the room. They told narratives that fleshed out the four men who gave their lives on that ship.\nAfter they were finished, a citation from U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) was presented to Post 77 and Post 70 for honoring the four chaplains.\n\"It is an important way for the community and society to make sure that the veterans know that their sacrifice and their effort has been appreciated,\" said local veteran and community liaison for Rep. Andy Haris Mike Detmer, who served in Falluhah during the Iraq War.\n\"I do a lot of invocations and benedictions at services,\" said Paula Grimes, Department of Maryland chaplain for the American Legion. \"It is from the heart. It is important to spread the word of the sacrifice about these four gentlemen. Everyone should know the story.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Shelly was part of the Terrapin Program through Maryland Environmental Service, the agency heading up the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island.\nAs part of the research program, Shelly spent her first year growing from a tiny hatchling to a young terrapin at Kent County Middle School before being release back on Poplar Island.\nFor Copeland, this was his first time raising a terrapin, an experience he described as \"amazing.\"\n\"Not only was it truly great for the students to learn more about terrapin ecology and physiology, it was also a good opportunity for students to learn about the environmental impacts we as humans impose on literally our backyard, the Chesapeake Bay,\" Copeland said.\nCawthorne said she loved every minute helping raise Shelly and was very thankful for the experience.\n\"Seeing the look of awe and excitement in the students' faces whenever Shelly made her way to my classroom was nothing short of wonderful. The students learned so much about terrapins and we were very sad to see her go,\" Cawthorne said.\nFor more than a decade, the State of Maryland has been rebuilding Poplar Island.\nIn its day, there were families that called Polar Island home. It also hosted a getaway used by the most powerful people in Washington, D.C., including U.S. presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\nThe waters of the Chesapeake eroded Poplar Island so much so that by 2000, it was predicted the entire island would soon be washed away.\nThe Poplar Island restoration site is still under construction. While no people live on the island, many species of wildlife now call it home — or at least a stop on their migratory route.\nScientists led by biologist Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University are conducting a study of terrapins on Poplar Island. They locate nests and count and measure eggs.\n\"A lack of land predators, undisturbed sandy shorelines, and a variety of habitat types make Poplar an ideal terrapin nesting site,\" the Terrapin Program website states.\nWith around 800 diamondback terrapins — the state reptile of Maryland — hatching annually on Poplar Island, the researchers collect about 150 eggs each year and give the juveniles to schools raise.\nThis \"head start\" program aims to determine if this level of human involvement in terrapins' early stages of life gives them a better chance in the long run of surviving in the nature world, according to the Terrapin Program site.\nIt also gives students the opportunity to more personally engage with the Bay's ecosystem.\n\"Through this program, students are playing an important role in relevant, cutting-edge research focused on the conservation of the species,\" the Terrapin Program site states. \"The combination of scientific applications, hands-on involvement and the emotional attachment to the terrapins provides a unique opportunity to inspire a meaningful connection with the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nThrough releasing Shelly back into the wild, Cawthorne and Copeland both said they hope the middle school students learned that any action they take, no matter how large or small, can have a huge impact on the health of the Bay.\nThe field trip was funded in part by the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund.\nPart of Mid-Shore Community Foundation, the education foundation fund helps cover the costs of extended field trips, provides mini-grants to teachers and more.\nFor details about the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund, or to make a donation, visit www.kent.k12.md.us/Foundation.aspx. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore came to Cambridge on Monday, Feb. 12, to speak about the ENOUGH Act that he has proposed. I had the opportunity to speak briefly prior to his comments and thought that I would share them with you here. Please see the relevant portion of them below.When I was asked to say something at this event, I decided to focus on the words \"enough\" and \"hope.\" Enough is the acronym for this important and needed legislation that the governor has proposed. It has somewhat different meanings that, I think, are relevant to this legislation.\nIt can mean \"as much or many of something as required\" as in \"you need to get enough of the right things to eat,\" and it can also mean that you are \"unwilling to tolerate anything more of something that is undesirable\" such as poverty or bad behavior. Both definitions are applicable to this legislation. We have not done the job that we could do to address systemically the challenges that the ENOUGH Act seeks to address.\nWhile I understand that the legislation primarily focuses on the funding of the initiative and how the government must implement it, I know that the Moore-Miller Administration is also thinking about the communities the legislation is intended to serve and the need for people within the community to do much of the hard work. So local training, local collaboration in implementing this legislation, more effective local utilization of resources and the opportunity to lift up all of Maryland and its people are areas of focus.\nThis past summer I was able to attend the installation ceremony for Judge Gayle Carr as president of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. I know Judge Carr from my time on the juvenile court bench in Virginia. The main focus of her speech was about \"hope\" and how it impacts children and families as well as all of the judges, child welfare workers, teachers, juvenile justice staff and others working with them.\nI see these goals in the governor's proposed legislation. I see this legislation as the cornerstone of the kind of change that I have hoped to see since moving to Maryland almost 14 years ago. What I hope to see in supplementary laws or administrative requirements implemented by the Governor's Office for Children are the things that I think will give children, their families and communities the \"Hope\" that Judge Carr talked about in her speech.\nShe said:\n\"What are we without hope? Who here among us has not achieved without having hope? Why should it be any different for the children, youth, adults, and families we serve?\n\"The hope I speak of propels us to keep striving; to get up again when we fall. Hope is not wishful thinking but confident expectations.\n\"Research and science have proven Hope changes outcomes. Hope produces positive results. It changes the trajectory particularly for our children, our most vulnerable children — the ones we are responsible for in our work.\"\nShe concluded with these words. \"You are optimistic if you think the future will be better than the past. You are hopeful if you believe the future will be better than the past, and you believe you have a role in making it so.\"\nThe hope that Judge Carr talked about is also needed by all of those people she mentioned who work with children and families. Just as the children and families need hope so do those who are working locally to help them. I have seen in my past work as a judge and consultant on child welfare what hope can do for a community, and it is a powerful force. I see Judge Carr's reference to hope as meaning \"Help Out People Everywhere.\"\nGov. Moore, thank you for your leadership and your vision and for placing this first cornerstone for what will change Maryland for a better future for everyone. I look forward to helping however I can.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Americans must speak out\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 381\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last Saturday night, the Trump regime used ICE to illegally detain Mahmoud Khalil (a green card holder) without warrant or charge, to try to arrest his pregnant wife and to kidnap Khalil to an undisclosed location it refused to share with his family. This illegal, terrorizing behavior would be expected from a dictatorship but not from our government.Any doubt as to the in terrorem role ICE would serve for the Trump regime is quickly vanishing. ICE is for Trump what the Gestapo was for Hitler, a force to stifle opposition with threats, force and torture.\nKhalil has no criminal record. All he did was to exercise his Constitutional rights by organizing peaceful protests at Columbia that opposed continued funding for Netanyahu as Netanyahu committed well-documented war crimes against Palestinians.\nWhen confronted, ICE first claimed Khalil's visa was being revoked but, when informed that he has a green card, changed its story to state his green card was being revoked. However, the decision to revoke a green card can only be made by an immigration judge after the government procures a warrant, makes a legal arrest, files charges, tries the person, convicts the person and allows that person to exhaust all appeals.\nInstead of allowing the due process our Constitution affords every person – citizen or not – the Trump regime executed an autocratic move to stifle dissent and disappear a dissenter that resembles the manner in which Putin deals with dissenters in Russia. This amounts to government terrorism and follows the Trump regime's open repression of student activism and political speech, in this instance criticism of Israel and Netanyahu. Thus, the Trump regime has shown it will use immigration to suppress free speech.\nIf Columbia secretly colluded with the Trump regime in the arrest, it may be a result of the regime's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. Trump proved that he is willing to use extortion to achieve personal goals when threatened to withhold funding to force Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, so it is not surprising that Trump would use extortion to force colleges to kowtow to his wishes to silence dissent by wrongfully withholding the funds they are entitled to receive, but it is chilling.\nAmericans must speak out against this brutal and illegal conduct.\nJACK L.

I've noticed that when my sawyer, he's cutting a tree, and the tree is really beautiful, everybody feels really good. Then when we get to a tree where the tree is kind of diseased and rotten, the mood kind of changes.\n\"I said to my sawyer, I said, 'Isn't that interesting when you have a tree that is all good and healthy and beautiful, your energy is good and positive. When you get a tree that's all diseased and rotten inside, you might be blaming it on something.' Isn't it interesting that you're exposing the energy of the tree and you're really receiving what is happening within the tree.\"\nVoss hopes Woodhenge will make visitors think and feel emotions and energy from the tree.\nAccording to Abby Lorenz, director of public engagement for Adkins Arboretum, conversations with Voss went on a for long time, but the energy shifted on the project after receiving a grant in July.\n\"More recently the energy and movement around this project is through a Public Arts Planning Grant with Maryland State Arts Council,\" Lorenz said. \"He received a grant funding to focus on the planning of the installation, so right now we have created a survey for people to give feedback on what they think on the project. So I think that's a big part of what we're looking for because this is not just art for artists, it's public art.\"\nThe next step for Woodhenge is applying for a second grant for $30,000 in the fall to begin construction, but according to Voss, they will need to do some fundraising to complete the $75,000 project.\nLorenz said the focus right now is informing the community about the project and getting their thoughts and ideas.\n\"We just recently had a community meeting where we invited people that had knowledge of Stonehenge and cultural landscapes to come together and give their feedback and ideas, and Vico shared his plan and intention of really opening one tree so that you feel like you're inside of one tree,\" Lorenz said.\nAt the feedback meeting, residents shared on how they felt visiting Stonehenge and how that same feeling and cultural significance can be conveyed in a tree landscape.\n\"I think there's excitement, there's intrigue and in a way that people are interested in really what does it mean,\" Lorenz said.\nWhile there is no set timeline for the project, Lorenz and Voss believe Woodhenge will be built and open to the public in 2026 or 2027.\nWoodhenge would sit on Nancy's Meadow on the north side of the Adkins Arboretum property. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's the biggest thing I'm proud of. They're dogs.\"\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Kent Island (1-2) took a 3-0 lead on Spencer Chappell's 44-yard field goal with 7:06 left in the first half. The Buccaneers stretched that lead to 10-0, when running back Jaxson Hess caught a short pass from quarterback Trace Klapaska and broke a handful of tackles en route to a 52-yard touchdown 32 seconds before intermission. Chappell added the extra point.\n\"The speed of the game was really fast, especially for our quarterback and our offensive line,\" said Griffith, who watched quarterback Brady Walls battle pressure for most of the first half. \"They've got a great defense. They play fast, they play hard.\n\"Tim had a great game plan,\" Griffith added of Kent Island head coach Tim Goodrich. \"We've played each other so many times. He's got a lot of defenses you practice for. So even what they were doing we practice. But you can't simulate how hard and how fast they play. They gave us a helluva time in the first half.\"\nKent Island put the Warriors in a deeper hole with just under 8 minutes left in the third quarter, when fullback Alex Brestensky busted loose for an 87-yard touchdown jaunt that — together with another Chappell PAT — made it 17-0.\nEaston answered.\nThree Jamier Copper carries netted 26 yards. Horsey ran for 8 and 5 yards. Walls then connected with Kyree Acree for a 37-yard gain, setting up the first of Horsey's three TD runs, a 3-yard run up the middle. Stanco's first PAT made it 17-7 with 5:33 left in the third quarter.\nThe Bucs widened their lead to 20-7 with 1:26 to go in the third on Chappell's 42-yard field goal.\nKent Island maintained that 13-point cushion, when Easton took over from its own 20 with 7:13 left in the game. Walls hit Zach Barnhart for a 42-yard pickup, completed a 12-yard gain to Carter Mooney, then found Barnhart for a 21-yard to the 1. Horsey capped the drive, slamming in from the 1. Stanco's second PAT made it 20-14 with 6:03 to go.\nEaston forced a three-and-out and took possession at its 30 with 4:23 remaining. A 9-yard completion from Walls to Barnhart coupled with a roughing-the-passer penalty on Kent Island, moved the Warriors to Kent Island's 40.\nOn third-and-10, Walls dumped a short pass to Horsey for a 22-yard pickup. A Walls-to-Mooney connection pushed Easton to the Bucs' 6. Horsey carried for gains of 2 and 3 yards, before launching himself over the goal line from 1 to tie the game at 20-20 with 1:28 left.\n\"I felt like (NFL Hall of Fame running back) Emmitt Smith jumping over the pile,\" Horsey said of his tying touchdown.\nOn came Stanco to convert his third PAT of the game for a 21-20 lead.\n\"After I made the first (point-after) kick, got the nervousness out,\" Stanco said. \"Then I made the second and we got close. And then the game was on me; game was on the line. I had to put it through the uprights and I did.\"\n\"I was nervous for him,\" Griffith said of Stanco. \"We've struggled on our special teams this year. It was an emphasis this week that specials had to be perfect and we were pretty good tonight. That was big. He (Stanco) has a great leg. He's very talented. And so does Kai Ferraris. Both of them, very talented. They just need more reps and it's hard when they're soccer players.\"\nKent Island's Andy Bennett returned the ensuing kickoff 10 yards before slipping at the 25. Four incompletions later, Easton took over, with Walls taking a knee twice to complete one of the bigger come-from-behind wins over Griffith's career as head coach.\n\"Second half I think we wore them down a little bit and we hit some big plays,\" Griffith said. \"And that was the difference.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The rain did nothing to stop walkers and runners of all ages from participating in the 2025 5K Color Fun Run/Walk, benefiting Kent Goes Purple.Kent Goes Purple is a substance abuse awareness and prevention initiative of the Kent County Sheriff's Office and Chestertown Rotary Club, engaging the community and youth to stand up against substance abuse.\nNow into its seventh year, the race began bright and early at Wilmer Park, extended down South Cross Street, turned at John Brown Road then returned to the park for a finish.\nIt kicked off with purple foam bubbles shooting courtesy of Willy Woo Woo Productions and a burst of blue paint at the finish line coating everybody. People scattered playfully away, ducking under the police tape heading for the road.\nAlong the route, participants, if they asked for it, were doused in more paint by over-eager students. Roadside, the Chestertown Elks Club provided water and encouragement. Police did a great job ensuring participants were safe from traffic as mothers walked their children in strollers, friends ran beside each other and dads jogged with their daughters.\nAfter the race, the Purple Jamboree was held at the park. Kids danced and played in the foam machine of Willy Woo Woo, who provided some sports games, popcorn, cotton candy and snow cones.\nPaul Gunther's Catering offered cheeseburgers and grilled chicken sandwiches.\nAlong the walkway toward the water, Shore Community Outreach Team were on-hand to administer health advice and blood pressure checks, the Elks informed people of their kids Drug Awareness Program handing out Frisbees, coloring books and other items. Recovery in Motion and the The AF Whitsitt Center offered assistance and information about their programs.\nAndy Meehan Chestertown Rotary Club member said, \"We had a very enthusiastic turnout.

It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the most reliable is that if one side is playing on a suit, it is wrong for the other side to play on it too.Today's deal is a straightforward example.West leads his fourthhighest heart against three no-trump. This gives declarer seven top tricks: two spades, one heart, three diamonds and one club. Assuming no 4-0 diamond split, two more tricks are readily available in diamonds. Or are they? Look at the spots. If the diamonds break 3-1, declarer will have to win the fourth round in his hand. With no dummy entry, the fifth diamond trick shrivels and dies like an earthworm on a hot pavement.However, South spotted a possibility. After winning the first trick with dummy's heart nine, he cashed the diamond queen and ace.West's club discard was a blow, but now declarer led the heart king.You see the idea behind this play. South knew West had started with at most five hearts, because West had led the five and declarer could see the three and four. South hoped that West would cash at least one more heart trick, on which the declarer would discard the blocking diamond seven or nine.However, West knew that if South thought it was right for North-South to play on hearts, it had to be wrong for East-West to do so too. West won with the heart ace and immediately switched to a spade.This condemned the contract. When declarer lost a trick in another suit, the defenders cashed their hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Glenelg consistently won draw controls, reached ground balls before the Lions, and seemed to have someone on the ball every time Queen Anne's (15-3) lost possession or had a pass miss connection.\n\"Lots of speed and explosiveness,\" Fitzgerald said of the Gladiators. \"And when you don't have lots of possessions you have to make every single one count.\n\"In the beginning of the first quarter we were,\" said Fitzgerald, whose team fell behind 2-0 in the opening 61 seconds, then cut that deficit in half with 8:46 left in the first quarter. \"We were working through some kinks on defense, and every time offense had it in the first quarter we were converting. And then it came down to the draw possessions, and just making sure we got the ball out safely. And we didn't do that as well as we have all season.\"\nGlenelg took a lead in never surrendered 34 seconds into the game when Kayleigh White (two goals) swept in the from the left and put a shot past Lions goalie Maddie George. Just 27 seconds later, Kamryn Henson (three goals) gained possession at the top of the box, dodged two defenders and stuck a shot into the right side of the net for a 2-0 lead.\nQueen Anne's, which entered the game on a 10-game winning streak in which it averaged 13 goals a game, didn't appear rattled, as it pulled within 2-1, when RJ Ensor set up Riley Klepper's goal. The Gladiators regained their two-goal cushion a little over a minute later, when Regan Kelleher (two goals, two assists) found Reilly Kelleher alone in front of the net for a goal. Maggie Metz (three goals) scored in transition, extending Glenelg's lead to 4-1 with 3:36 left in the opening quarter.\nThe Lions answered, as Baillie Pinder dished to Ensor to make it 4-2 with 52.4 seconds remaining in the first quarter.\nBut Queen Anne's wouldn't score again until Madison Brown's goal with 3:40 left on a running clock in the fourth period made it 13-3.\n\"Offensively, they were all moving,\" Fitzgerald said of Glenelg. \"Great off-ball movement. That's a strong team.\"\nA team that scored nine consecutive goals after Ensor's strike to build a 13-2 lead with 9:41 left in the contest.\nGlenelg had six different goal scorers before Henson netted her second off an assist from Emmy Dello Russo with 58.8 seconds left in the first half, pushing the Gladiators' lead to 8-2 at halftime. Chloe Key, Dello Russo and Regan Kelleher also scored in the first half.\nFitzgerald rotated George in goal with Emma Dulin throughout the game, both making big saves to keep the score respectable.\n\"Both those girls did an amazing job,\" Fitzgerald said.\nGlenelg tacked on three third-quarter goals, with Henson scoring once and Metz twice. Regan Kelleher and White scored one apiece in the fourth before Brown ended Queen Anne's scoring drought.\n\"I do know we have the makings of being right there with them,\" said Fitzgerald, whose team was bidding for its second state title in four years. \"Wasn't our day today. Super proud of the team. They have nothing to hang their heads about. We got here. We deserved to be here. And we'll be back.\n\"Every year we start out and try to figure out what the roles are going to be,\" Fitzgerald continued. \"This year we made those roles very apparent, very early; earlier than I ever have before. And that's what worked for us this year. Everybody fell into their role. I'm fortunate every year at Queen Anne's as their coach to just have amazing student-athletes.\"\nBASEBALLBRUNSWICK 26, COL. RICHARDSON 6FREDERICK — Derrick Mitchell had a pair of hits for Colonel Richardson, which had its hopes of a third straight Class 1A state final appearance end in Tuesday's semifinal round at McCurdy Field.\nBrayden Dadds, Caleb Rouser and Gavin Whitby each had one hit for the Colonels, who finished the season 20-3. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the capital budget decreased by about $6.3 million, which is roughly 58%.\nWithin the operating budget, Tolley said the operating government funds budget increased about $2.9 million, or 4%. She said most of that increase is attributable to a 5% \"across the board\" raise to county employees.\n\"That was one of the council's missions,\" she said. \"So therefore, that was one of the top priorities in this budget.\"\nTolley said that to balance this, other cuts needed to be made. She said those cuts were made in collaboration with department directors, and departments will still be maintaining full operations.\nThe county's proposed tax rates are the same as the fiscal year 2024 budget. The proposed real property tax is $1 per assessed $100 of value. The proposed personal property tax is $2.44 per assessed $100 of value.\nAccording to the draft budget document, within Cambridge, the real property tax rate is $0.9267 per assessed $100 of value. Within Hurlock, the real property tax rate is $0.9179 per assessed $100 of value. This is due to tax differentials for these two towns.\nTolley also talked about the grants budget during her presentation. According to the draft budget document, the county is leveraging $903,919 for $3.9 million in grant funds.\nAt the council meeting, the Dorchester County Council introduced the budget. Public hearings for the proposed budget will be held May 14 and May 21. A final hearing and adoption of the budget is set for May 28 during the regular council meeting.\nAlong with introducing the draft budget, the council passed a resolution that gives the county the authority to invest in the Maryland Local Government Investment Pool.\n\"I think it will give us some great returns,\" Tolley said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In other words, margins could be small if the prices stay at the low end of the estimate.\nWilley's presentation touched on wheat and weather. He said he didn't have any positive insights on wheat supply and use.\n\"So many Mid-Atlantic mills have closed,\" he said. \"What's been going on across the country is it's just not a pleasant deal.\"\nWilley said that in 2001, the United States had a total of 63 million acres of wheat. The estimate for 2024 and 2025 is 16 million less acres.\nTouching on climate change, Willey said extreme weather is becoming the norm.\n\"Don't be a climate denier,\" he said. \"There are a lot of people that are still denying that we have a climate problem. It's real.\"\nMichael Bostic Jr., a farmer in Church Hill, said he was not surprised by Willey's insights.\n\"It's our job to keep up on stuff like this,\" he said. \"It's all been in the pipeline for a while.\"\nBostic, who grows corn, wheat and soybeans, said he is trying to stay optimistic about what's to come this year.\n\"But it's not going to be great,\" he said.\nAt the end of his presentation, Willey encouraged the farmers in the audience to consider their supply chain in relation to value chain, or how much money is in a product.\n\"When somebody buys it, how much money does that generate and what percentage of it do you get?\" he said, explaining what value chain is.\nWilley encouraged the audience to consider artificial intelligence's place in all this.\n\"You guys are really good at knowing what your costs are,\" he said. \"With AI, I think we're going to find a way to not only know what the costs are, but we're going to find out, not only the supply chain, but what the value chain is. And remember, other people will be able to figure out what your portion of the value chain is.\"\nWilley said he thinks that in the next four or five years, there will be a trend in people deciding they want to raise prices on the things that go into producing a crop.\n\"Because there's so much money in the value chain, and they want more of it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of these items are to be completed to match the approved permit and site plan.\nWahl said Underwood and Associates is required to complete this phase of the project by April 19.\nIn December, the Commissioners of Oxford announced that although the Strand Beach project was signed off on in June by previous Town Manager Cheryl Lewis, the project had not been completed to the specifications that Underwood and Associates had originally presented.\nThe plan for the project was to create a berm, place hooks along the east and west areas of the Strand to bring in sand, create small islands in the water to reduce waves coming onto the beach and plant low marsh grasses on those islands. During the commissioners meeting in December, Commissioner Katrina Greer said not all the grasses had been planted on the islands and the islands were two feet higher in elevation than they were supposed to be.\nThat month, Greer brought together the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Underwood and Associates and the organizations that funded the project to ensure Underwood and Associates would bring down the elevation of the islands and take out the sand that goes out to the headlands at no cost to the town. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 26.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 9.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 3.1 cents in the last week and stands at $4.02 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.25 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.54per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 6.5 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.57 per gallon today. The national average is up 17.1 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 0.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nApril 8, 2023: $3.51per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.58 per gallon)April 8, 2022: $3.74per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.12 per gallon)April 8, 2021: $2.78per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)April 8, 2020: $1.98per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.88 per gallon)April 8, 2019: $2.68per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)April 8, 2018: $2.67per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.65 per gallon)April 8, 2017: $2.36per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon)April 8, 2016: $2.05per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.04 per gallon)April 8, 2015: $2.35per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon)April 8, 2014: $3.59per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.58 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.60 per gallon, up 7.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.52 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.72 per gallon, up 4.7 cents per gallon from last week's $3.68 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.58 per gallon, down 3.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.61 per gallon.\n\"After a brief break, gas prices have leapt back up, driven by extensive refinery maintenance on the West Coast, where prices have increased notably; only a handful of states have seen prices decline over the last week,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With oil prices rising to nearly $87 per barrel last week, their highest since October, we are not only facing the seasonal factors that push prices up — refinery maintenance, the switch to summer gasoline and rising demand — but also escalating crude oil prices as OPEC's production cuts continue to cause declining global oil inventories, with escalations between Iran and Israel adding to concerns of further destabilization.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They will also be asked to submit the proper forms such as a copy of a federal tax return and information from their insurance company.\nShe added that it has more success of being approved if it is $25,000 or under as well.\nIt's similar to the COVID-19 loan, she said. However with their new automated processing software, Tschanett hopes it will be easier for people to navigate the website.\nShe acknowledged their office heard complaints during the Covid-19 time period.\nFor anyone still overwhelmed maneuvering through the website, Tschanett invited them to talk to one of their many loan officers either via email or in-person at one of their three sites in our area.\nThere's plenty of help available, whether it be through their own loan officers, or their partners at SCORE (a business mentoring organization) or the Small Business Development Center.\nThey will answer any questions that pop up.\nFor instance, if a small business already has a Covid-19 loan can they still be eligible for this one?\nTschanett's answer was yes. A loan officer will work with the business owner to change the terms of the loan.\n\"They'll take you step by step,\" Tschanett assured the public.\nWith a December 30 deadline to get the information in, her advice is to start the application process early.\nShe predicted that businesses will look for grants before loans.

    "content": "Rep. Jamie Raskin comes to Cambridge for town hall\n\n March 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Energy was high as Eastern Shore residents packed the gymnasium at Mace's Lane Middle School Saturday for Cambridge Indivisible and Eastern Shore Indivisible's town hall event with Maryland U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).\"I know I was not your first choice,\" Raskin said over cheers from the crowd. \"I heard your congressman couldn't quite squeeze you in today.\"\nRaskin represents most of Montgomery County and part of Prince George's County. Cambridge Indivisible Co-Founder and Co-Chair Michelle Fowle said the organization invited Maryland U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) — who represents the Eastern Shore and lives in Cambridge — but Harris didn't respond.\n\"We made it super easy for him to be here, and he didn't even have the decency to formally decline,\" Fowle said. \"He just completely ignores us and just tells everybody that we're paid $40 an hour and bused in.\"\nAlthough Harris wasn't at the Cambridge Indivisible event Saturday, he is holding a telephone hall for residents on Tuesday, March 25. Those who would like to attend the event, which will be from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., can listen in by calling 833-380-0671 or can stream the event at harris.house.gov/live.\nDuring the town hall Saturday, Raskin expressed concerns with the Republican Party's priorities.\nHe brought up recent actions taken by President Donald Trump and the the Department of Government Efficiency. He said he is trying to \"stop this savage assault on American democracy.\"\n\"They're not opponents of corruption,\" Raskin said. \"They're agents of corruption.\"\nWhen it came to the question and answer portion of the town hall, residents asked what could be done in response to the Trump administration's actions.\nMany made a point to mention they were not paid to be there, referencing Harris' words following a rally Cambridge Indivisible organized in opposition to the congressman March 13. Harris told members of the media he didn't believe many of the people at the rally were his constituents, adding that he believed they were paid protesters \"brought in by buses.\"\nCommenting on the Saturday town hall, Harris said in a statement Monday that it's \"ironic\" that \"ultra-radical leftist\" Raskin is \"suddenly pretending to care about our farmers, watermen and people on the Eastern Shore after four years of voting for reckless Biden administration policies and radical environmental regulations — which almost crushed our Eastern Shore economy.\"\n\"If these protests weren't being paid for and influenced by radical Democrat activists, Jaime Raskin would have stayed on the western shore — right where he and his radical policies belong,\" Harris said.\nThroughout the event Saturday, volunteers were available with smart phones to capture residents' stories.\n\"Andy Harris can ignore our emails, he can dodge our phone calls and he can refuse to hold a town hall,\" Cambridge Indivisible Co-Founder and Co-Chair Andy Fowle said. \"But he cannot erase our stories.\"\nRetired East New Market resident Roscoe Handy, who attended the event, said he has concerns about the fate of Social Security, Medicare and the U.S. Department of Education. He said Harris needs to hear from his constituents and put a face to their name.\n\"I didn't necessarily vote for him. However, I'm in his district,\" said Handy, a Democrat.\nAt the end of the event, Raskin was asked if he has plans to run for president in the next U.S. presidential election.\n\"I will do whatever is necessary for us to save our democracy,\" he said in response as applause and cheers filled the room.\nThis report has been updated to include comment from Andy Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is a mother, she is working on a doctorate in education and she was recently appointed as president of the Preston Commissioners.And, she has just cut the ribbon on her new business support services building.\nWinston has turned a 3,900-square-foot old bank into a multifaceted space to incubate other businesses.\n\"We do administrative support services. So part of that is to offer the business center services, you can come in and get your copies made, fax, scan, notary,\" Winston said. She also offers call center services and tax returns.\nHer business's name is Van Tech Business Solutions. With it, she hopes to provide support to other local entrepreneurs.\nThe chamber of commerce has been a huge support in her efforts, Winston said, along with her friends, family and other community members.\n\"Tracy Snyder, director, she led the ribbon cutting ceremony. The whole community was there. People came from near and far. I had family that traveled in, and I had other businesswomen that traveled from the western shore to come over in support. My bishop was here to bless the building,\" she said.\nEntrepreneurs see potential where others just drive by, Winston said. She is hoping to employ five people.\n\"That was one of the goals behind purchasing this property. As well as carrying out the vision of the mayor to bring economic development to the town. For so long this building was vacant. It has been a great six months of development,\" she said.\nShe reached out to the Maryland Capital Enterprise Women's Business Center in Salisbury to get help with her loan. She shared her business plan and didn't have any problem getting the funding, she said.\n\"This is all part of my leadership is to empower women in business, to really get out there. If you have a business, don't be afraid,\" Winston said.\nWinston has a lot of space. Her own business needs only require about ¼ of the whole footprint. She plans to rent out the remaining space to long-term tenants as well as offer desks and office space for short-term business needs.\nShe has two renters already. One is Elegant Affairs event planning service and the other is Eternal Love Cleaning Service. There will also be a musical organ repairman, who will have his showroom in the back. She wants to open her front lot to food trucks.\n\"If you work from home or remotely, you can just come in and work in a different space or meet a client here. I also have more private office space you can rent by the day. Just go on my website and reserve your space for the day — you have a furnished office,\" she said.\nShe knows this will bring more businesses to town, another one of her goals, both as a businessperson and as a local elected official.\n\"If you want to see more businesses come to town, you have to lead the way,\" she said. \"... I am an entrepreneur. It is all about bringing the resources to the community and allowing others to also to grow and expand their business opportunities. Why not do it together? I love partnerships and collaboration,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The agency is still accepting survey comments, which can be accessed via the SHA project page. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEaston Town Council Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello, center, speaks to a State Highway Administration representative about potential improvements to Matthewstown Road. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He talked about a student who, over the last four years, went from not attending class, to arguing with Tucker to calling Tucker the reason they come to school every day.\n\"There were a lot of times that I didn't want to get up and come to school, but I thought (about) what you told me,\" Tucker said about the student. \"And it inspired me to get here. Maybe not on time, but I got here.\"\nThe graduation ceremony brought tears and laughter on Thursday evening. Along with the speeches, the CSD chorus performed \"I Lived\" by OneRepublic, and the students, along with some staff and administration members, performed \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey and \"The Time of My Life\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Washington Street and Peachblossom Road.\n\"I'm gonna miss every bit of it because I've been doing it all my life,\" Jenkins, who is best known by his nickname 'Nut,' said. \"Just like starting driving your first time, you want to keep right on driving. That's what I felt about this.\n\"I've enjoyed every bit of it, working with the community and working with my fine officers and everything. …(I) give them respect, and they give me respect.\"\nJenkins, 81, has 54 years of service at schools in Easton, along with over 20 years in the St. Michaels community on the weekends. He's been manning the intersection for decades, managing the chaotic, busy scene of buses departing, students walking home and parents picking up their children.\n\"Wait 'til I tell them to go, don't go on your own,\" Jenkins said of his longtime message to the students. \"Wait until I turn around to tell you to go, but they're great for that. They really do (listen).\"\nJosepha Price and Carla Beavers, who each have children that just wrapped up sixth grade at EMS, led an effort to honor Jenkins Tuesday morning. Price and Beavers worked with the school's Family Teacher Organization to have students and parents drop off cards.\nThey energized a large part of the Easton community prior to Tuesday morning with a Facebook post, which garnered hundreds of likes, and a wealth of appreciation for what Jenkins has done for pedestrian safety in Easton.\n\"He's tough on us parents that drive, but so soft and enthusiastic to our children,\" Price wrote. \"You know wherever he is, the kids will be safe, and I can't think of any greater purpose than protecting children.\"\nAs Easton Middle's early dismissal on its last day commenced, Price and others held up \"Honk for Mr. Jenkins\" signs in front of the Idlewild Park fountain, down the street from the school. Some students walked over to embrace Jenkins and say goodbye.\nOnce dismissal finished, EMS administrators, teachers and staff all walked down to the intersection to greet Jenkins, who was accompanied by one of his two daughters.\n\"They all respect me and everything with my work, and I respect all of them by being here,\" Jenkins said.\nIn 2022, he was presented a Governor's Citation by former Gov. Larry Hogan for his dedication to keeping the community safe.\nJenkins' plans moving forward are to spend time with his daughters and \"take it easy and relax.\"\n\"I just wish I was 30 years younger,\" Jenkins said.\nWhen asked if he would do it all over again for another 50-plus years, the beloved crossing guard had no hesitation.\n\"If I could, I really would,\" Jenkins said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's the plastic bottles the water comes in that are potentially harmful to our health and environment.The folks at the Mayo Clinic say we need to be concerned about BPA.Exposure to BPA, they say, is a concern because of possible health effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. The Food and Drug Administration suggests that very low-level exposure to BPA is safe; however, the agency is engaged in ongoing research. Sounds scary to me.Health issues are one thing, but the effect on the environment is another.According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2018, the U.S. generated nearly 36 million tons of plastic waste. This has been a problem for so long that Concord, Massachusetts, in 2012 became the first municipality in the nation to ban the sale of single-serving water bottles. San Francisco in 2014 implemented one of the strictest bottled water bans in the country by banning the sale of bottled water on public property.Extreme reactions? Perhaps, but 36 million tons of plastic waste is no small matter.If health and environment issues aren't enough to give us pause, consider that single-serve bottled water is not that great for our wealth, either. Do the math. It all adds up.Every day I fill my water bottle at least three times (it has a 24-ounce capacity). I find that I drink a lot more water just because this particular container is convenient, BPA-free and pretty cool, too. What do I like most about it? I don't have to tip it up to drink from it.Think of an adult \"sippy cup\" with a built-in straw and flip top.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Only bilingual law firm in Kent County celebrates 1 year\n\n April 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — The First Friday event of April brought friends, neighbors and visitors to downtown Chestertown. Some of those stopped by the law offices of Campbell and Furneisen to celebrate the company's one-year anniversary.Partners Bridget Campbell and Ivette Furneisen were both nominated for Eastern Shore's 2024 Women to Watch. And according to their website, Furneisen is \"one of very few Spanish-speaking lawyers on the shore, and possibly the only native Spanish-speaking. It continues, \"Furneisen has quickly gained a reputation as a friend to Hispanics and other immigrants in the area, helping with traffic and family court, visas and applications for citizenship.\"\nFurneisen said this anniversary is a significant celebration due to that distinction.\nOver sparkling beverages and catering courtesy of Happy Chicken, and while balancing conversation with friends and well-wishers, Furneisen shared why she feels like her work is more vital than ever.\nIt started, she said, 15 years ago. In her native country of Spain, she was working for a nonprofit doing immigration work. She extended that realm of her expertise by studying law at George Mason University. Ultimately, she and her husband, who worked for American Airlines, discovered Kent County.\nNow a year in to running her own practice advocating for Spanish speakers, she expressed concern for her clients, some of whom had been detained by immigration police being caught in offenses such as traffic violations.\nThese incidences, she said, are why she decided to pursue law further.\n\"Everyone deserves representation. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor,\" Furneisen stated.\nShe takes a lot of cases from the public defender's office for those who normally could not afford a lawyer.\n\"Now, I can be an advocate for them. And not just in the courts. I really care,\" she said.\nThe other half of the firm is Bridget Campbell. She handles family law, real estate, business formation and other practices.\nLike her legal partner, Campbell is grateful to be representing Kent County. With both of them working jointly, they cast a wide net of services.\nSome of the most rewarding work is representing children as a best interest attorney, Campbell said. It is her job to advocate for children, give them a voice, and from those assessments, persuade the judge to act in the children's best interest.\nThis involves talking to the parents, the therapists and the children, being present for them in their time of need, Campbell said. As a mother of three boys, this is very near to her heart as she reflects on her time studying law at Villanova, before attending Washington College.\nOriginally born in Pennsylvania, she has established roots here after studying law at Villanova and attending Washington College. She is president of the Kent County Humane Society, dedicated to promoting animal welfare, \"preventing unnecessary pain and suffering for domestic companions in the community.\"\nBoth attorneys see themselves reaching beyond their law profession to help those in need.\n\"Ivette and I find a way to give back to the community every way we can,\" Campbell said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Cooking for The King\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1061\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's column is being written from the heart. The month of August is always a busy month, but not too busy for me to reflect on the past.Those of you who know me also know this is the month I usually travel to Memphis and meet with worldwide friends to gather at Graceland and pay respects to Elvis.\nAug. 16, 1977 was the day we teenagers of the late 1950s and '60s lost one of our favorite idols. Hard to believe it's been 48 years since I heard the news that morning. As goes with all our idols, Elvis is just as popular today with fans of all ages.\nMy answer to those who ask why I liked him so much is easy to explain: My older siblings loved the late 1940s through the mid-1950s music, and when I became a preteen, my generation needed a change of dance styles and rock 'n' roll music. And we got it — to the horror of our elders. That is true for all generations.\nWhen I meet fans from Germany, some are my age, but some are 30 and 40 years old and remembering their grandparents and parents talking about Elvis serving in the Army in Germany.\nLet's explore some of the King's favorite foods. Elvis loved his mother's meatloaf, and I occasionally make this recipe.\nMEATLOAF\n2 lbs ground beef, one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, two minced cloves garlic, 4 oz crushed saltines, 8-oz can crushed tomatoes, 8-oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together ground beef with onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed saltines and crushed tomatoes. Mix well and form into a loaf and place in a baking pan. Bake covered, for 45 minutes. In the meantime, mix tomato sauce and ketchup and set aside. After 45 minutes of baking, remove the meatloaf and pour the ketchup on top and return to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes and serve with mashed potatoes.\nROAST BEEF\n2 tbsps black pepper, 1 1/2 tbsps salt, 2 tbsps garlic, 6 lb beef, 1 1/2 cups water.\nMix pepper, salt and garlic to form a paste and rub on this mixture on the beef. Place this roast in a baking pan, add water and place in a 350-degree oven. Bake for about 4 hours or until tender. You can steam some fresh vegetables to serve with the roast.\nSPANISH OMELETTE\n4 eggs, 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, salt and pepper.\nBeat eggs well and mix in bell pepper and onion. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded cheese of your choice with salt and pepper to taste. Cook in a greased skillet for about 4 minutes.\nHAMBURGER STEAK ELVIS\n2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHES\nSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES\n1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBefore I close the column today, I need to honor my late brother, Staff Sgt. (E6) Ollie L. Hitchens Jr., who would be celebrating his 78th birthday on Aug. 15. Ollie served 20 years in the U.S. Army and pulled three tours of duty in Vietnam.\nOllie and I had a lot in common — our likes, dislikes, love for Chevy cars, love of family, patriotic responsibilities, personalities and love for Elvis.\nOllie loved our mom's old-fashioned cooking and often wrote home about how he missed it. While on his many trips home Mom would make sure to have those foods ready — fried chicken, pot roast, pork chops, mashed potatoes, fried liver with gravy, chicken and dumplings, fresh lima beans with tomatoes, corn and potatoes and of course homemade biscuits. I have shared many of these recipes with you in previous columns.\nRest in peace, brother — as I always say, \"All gave some, and some gave all.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Residual bill passed by Caroline County Commissioners\n\n September 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 365\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — On Tuesday morning, the Caroline County Commissioners voted to approve the long-discussed bill that would establish county regulations for storing food processing residuals, animal waste from the food processing process.These residuals, particularly dissolved air floatation, or DAF, residuals have been the topic of several heated discussions in the county since residents began raising health complaints and environmental concerns over how the material was being stored by some in the county late last year.\nThe county came up with a permitting system. There will be a universal permit requirement in order to store food processing residuals. It creates limitations on how residuals can be stored and permits the county to fine violators.\nIt would require that those storing the material use closed-top containers, going a step further than recently passed state legislation.\nAttorney Stewart Barroll said commissioners and Caroline County staff had heard \"voluminous\" public comments that have been taken into account.\nPrior to voting, two amendments were approved by commissioners involving distances from the storage containers.\nCommissioner Franklin Bartz said he would prefer the storage distance and an occupied dwelling be increased to 2,000 feet measured horizontally rather than the 1,250-foot distance that was in the bill.\nAfter discussion, the commissioners unanimously voted to approve the change.\nCommissioner J. Travis Breeding requested a second amendment that would require the storage not to be within 500 feet of a well. This way, it would allow property owners to move wells somewhere else on their property to be 500 feet away from stored residuals to not contaminate water sources.\nCommissioner Larry Porter brought up the discussion of postponing voting on the act until the Maryland Department of Agriculture shares their regulations. The vote had been postponed at the prior two meetings so the commissioners could review the proposed amendments to the legislation.\nBreeding said there would not be a need to postpone for regulation changes because commissioners are acting well within the parameters of Maryland statue.\n\"There's only so much that the Department of Agriculture can do,\" Breeding said. \"Everything that we have done inside of this legislature is not in conflict with the statue that the state has.\"\nThe bill was unanimously approved by the commissioners and has been enacted into the county law. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Ford spun and went rear-first into the building at Jeffers Chapel, police said.\nThe Nissan overturned onto its driver's side, and the driver was taken by ambulance to Christiana Hospital. No other injuries were reported, according to police.\n\"A truck took out the whole front side of the building,\" Jeffers Chapel trustee Lisa Kennedy said, calling the incident \"devastating for my whole family.\"\n\"We are praying we can rebuild and fix it,\" Kennedy said.\nThe one-room historic Black church was built around 1894 by her ancestors, she said. Jeffers Chapel was established in 1894 by local families, and the church and surrounding grounds are still cared for and maintained by descendants of the original founding families, according to Kennedy.\nThe church was originally affiliated with the United Methodist denomination but closed for regular services due to low membership. In 1995, it was incorporated as a non-denominational house of worship, she said.\nThe church now opens about once a year or for special occasions, and the fellowship was preparing to celebrate the 103rd homecoming, she said.\nKennedy credited first responders, including the Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company, for swiftly stabilizing the building to prevent collapse and moving church items — including pews and bibles — into storage.\n\"It has just been an outpouring of help and we really, really appreciate it,\" she said.\nHomecoming celebrations are still planned, with neighboring churches offering space for services or with outdoor tents, according to Kennedy.\nThe church is awaiting insurance and structural engineering reports to determine repair costs, she said.\n\"We are confident that our little chapel can be restored and we welcome prayers and monetary donations to ensure we are able to reopen for our Annual Homecoming in the near future,\" Kennedy said.\nSupport can be made via GoFundMe under the title \"Support Jeffers Chapel's Restoration After Accident.\"\nFor more information about Jeffers Chapel, contact Lisa Kennedy at lisak2595@gmail.com \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass limits will protect their future\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALLISON COLDEN | Section: Columns \n \n 702\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This season anglers and commercial fishermen are following new striped bass limits in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic Coast.There's good reason.\nPersistent concerns about low striped bass numbers led Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission this May to take additional steps to address the number of striped bass that are dying after being caught and released, as well as unsustainable commercial fishing rates.\nThe commission's latest steps aim to get rebuilding efforts back on track. We must face the hard truth that striped bass are struggling. Concerns stem from below average numbers recorded over last five years by Maryland's juvenile striped bass survey — an annual count of the number of young striped bass in Chesapeake tributaries. The 2023 count was dismal — the second-lowest since the survey began in 1957.\nThe Bay's commercial striped bass catch has seen a decline of about 40 percent from 2012 to 2022. Maryland and Virginia's commercial harvest totaled 4.5 million pounds in 2012 and just 2.7 million pounds in 2022, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThese numbers make it clear: Without action now, there might not be a striped bass fishery in the future.\nNEW LIMITS\nTo address population concerns, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Striped Bass Management Board voted at its spring meeting to establish a workgroup to reduce catch and release mortality. The workgroup will explore the effectiveness of season closures, impacts of different types of fishing tackle and the reduction in fishing effort needed to reduce striped bass losses.\nEarlier this year, Maryland implemented emergency regulations to prohibit fishing for striped bass during crucial spring spawning times (April 1 through May 15). The state also closed fishing for striped bass during two weeks in late July, when fish are most likely to get stressed and die after release.\nTo meet additional the commission's requirements, all Atlantic Coast states implemented a one-fish limit for recreational anglers. In the Chesapeake Bay, keepers must measure between 19 and 24 inches.\nStates also implemented a 7 percent reduction in the commercial harvest.\nLEAVE THE BIG FISH\nWhat has everyone so concerned is the lack of smaller striped bass present in the Bay. The last time we saw a strong group of young striped bass was back in 2015 — which are the big fish being caught today. We must leave these fish in the water to reproduce and rebuild the striped bass population. As a recent Maryland DNR study shows, older, larger female striped bass produce far more eggs. There's extra risk in hot months when the water is warm and holds less oxygen, making catch and release mortality rates are high. When air temperatures are above 95 degrees, about 17 percent of shallow hooked striped bass died after release, according to a Maryland DNR study.\nAnglers in Maryland who care about striped bass can take the following steps to help ensure the fishery's future:\nAvoid targeting striped bass during summer (June through August) when high water temperatures stress fish and make them less likely to survive being caught. Anglers can reference Maryland DNR's Striped Bass Advisory Forecast to determine if air and water temperatures are safe.Practice careful catch and release tactics, such as using barbless circle hooks, keeping fish in the water, and supporting fish with two hands if handling.Try fishing for other species, such as invasives like blue catfish or snakehead. The upper Bay and its tributaries are prime for targeting pickerel, white perch, and yellow perch. In higher salinity areas, anglers can target cobia, red drum, speckled trout, Spanish mackerel, and many other species.\n1980s MORATORIUM\nForty years ago, striped bass numbers reached a crisis point. Fishery regulators implemented a moratorium that shut down Maryland's striped bass fishery from 1985 to 1989. Striped bass numbers rebounded through the 1990s, and the moratorium is considered a major success story for fisheries management.\nBut there are new factors challenging the current recovery of striped bass, including climate change, pollution, habitat loss, invasive species and overfishing. New fishing limits are one of the most immediate, effective actions that can be taken to rebuild striped bass numbers.\nMaking these sacrifices today will help us avoid another moratorium and ensure that the striped bass fishery has a future.\nAllison Colden is the Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gag order in Trump trial is wrong - COMMENTARY\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 704\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan overseeing United States v. Donald Trump issued a gag order prohibiting a leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump, from engaging in speech aimed at \"government staff,\" among others, during his trial.Listen, I understand the disdain some conservatives feel for the former president. I share the sentiment.But if you're cheering on a judge who's inhibiting political speech on rickety grounds, you're no friend of \"democracy\" or the Constitution.\"Mr. Trump may still vigorously seek public support as a presidential candidate, debate policies and people related to that candidacy, criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution is politically motivated,\" Chutkan explained. \"But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pre-trial smear campaign against participating government staff, their families and foreseeable witnesses.\"Who is Chutkan to dictate the contours of a presidential candidate's political speech? What if one of the \"participating government staff\" or a family member is compromised by partisanship?Moreover, preemptively suggesting that without gagging, Trump will engage in a \"smear campaign\" is as prejudicial to the case as any of the inflammatory things Trump has thrown around. It implies that any accusation now aimed at prosecutors is untrue.Trump contends that he is being railroaded by special counsel Jack Smith, the longtime federal prosecutor who works on behalf of Democrats and President Joe Biden. You might believe the special counsel is a chaste defender of Lady Justice, but there's ample evidence that partisan considerations are in play. Fears of a politicized Justice Department are real. As we speak, the head of the Democratic Party is being mollycoddled by the state in a very similar case involving classified documents.Whatever the case, the Justice Department now plays a big part in Trump's campaign for the presidency - and probably his legal case, as well.If the state's accusations can be spread throughout the media before a trial, why can't the defendant speak openly, as well?In the name of fairness, Chutkan contends that Trump does not enjoy unfettered First Amendment rights because he might intimidate witnesses.It's already illegal to intimidate witnesses.Charge him if he does it. Laws already exist to cover all the other premises Smith has used to rationalize the gag order.The notion that a jury pool is going to be impartial in a trial involving a divisive former president, who is not only a leading contender for the presidency but one of the most famous people on Earth, is absurd. And the notion a D.C. jury pool will be impartial when it comes to Trump is fantastical. There is little that can be done about it. But further gagging the defendant only feeds, at the very minimum, the perception that this is all politically motivated.Establishment media informs us that the gag order is just \"narrow\" and meant to \"protect the integrity of the trial and the jury pool.\" In her Solomonic wisdom, Chutkan cut the state's request in half. A \"narrow\" gag order limiting free speech is still a gag order limiting free speech. The fact that Smith was seeking even broader limitations only makes Trump's claims more plausible.Smith has argued that Trump should not be afforded \"special treatment\" because he's a candidate. He's right. No one's right to defend themselves or to engage in speech should be inhibited, not even during trials (though any good lawyer will tell clients, for their own good, to shut up). Still, gag orders are almost always an unconstitutional prior restraint. For years, the American Civil Liberties Union and similar groups argued the same.I'm sure many people simply believe Trump deserves it. Think, though, about the precedent: Administrations can now launch prosecutions against political rivals - calibrated to take place in favorable cities and timed to coincide with elections - and then demand gag orders be implemented on those running for office. If you think they won't do it to others, you haven't been paying attention.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

We're trying to be more transparent about what is going on down at Town Hall, and we want the public to be engaged.\"\nDuring Monday's meeting, residents voiced multiple times that the town needed to maintain more open communication with the public.\nEric Padgett, business owner and owner of multiple properties in Federalsburg, spoke passionately about the town's issues and about the good in the town.\n\"I've been walking around town. I watch everything that's going on. Nobody is held accountable for nothing,\" Padgett said. \"Count the town managers, every ... one of them have never walked around, drove around, asked anybody any questions about nothing. … The town needs to open up at 7 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. so these people who have a problem can go in there and do something about it.\"\nA proposal to have the Caroline County Sheriff's Office take over policing duties for the town garnered a lot of back-and-forth among residents.\nFormer Police Chief Donald Nagel spoke on the topic by asking how important police protection was to the residents by show of hands. All residents raised their hand indicating it was important.\n\"I worked in this town 24 years or whatever, and it was rough, and we had to bring it back, and we brought it back,\" Nagel said. \"I'm not here for any accolades or anything. I just know this town by word. You're not going to get the same service by having the sheriff's department in here that you have now. People know you're police officers, so please, don't do away with the police.\"\nMultiple residents thought differently about the police department. Some indicated the Sheriff's Office could offer better coverage to the town.\nResidents who spoke agreed on that property tax prices, wastewater problems and lack of transparency from the town government were pressing issues.\nResident Danielle Brodka acknowledged the town's efforts to be transparent, but without work, she doesn't believe the town residents' anger will change.\n\"Is it a wonder that everyone in this building is angry because there is so much that has been addressed?\" Brodka said.\n\"I don't want you to think that I'm saying it's each one of you individuals,\" she said to town officials. \"You all have different tenure, you all have different goals. But is it any wonder that everybody in this building is upset because there is a lot going on.\"\nBrodka and many other residents in the room expressed their support of the town's plan to hold quarterly meetings like the one Monday.\n\"I am glad that you are going to have quarterly meetings because they are absolutely necessary,\" she said. \"I am glad that you are telling me that there is going to be more follow through. But until we see it, I don't think anyone's going to believe it. I think this town is going to continue to be angry until we have results.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A battle royal at the library\n\n February 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 810\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I'm pretty sure I have William Shakespeare and Bernard Cornwell to thank for the fact the battle of Agincourt has long fascinated me, for it was after I read Cornwell's novel of the same title and saw Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" that I began to seriously ponder that battle's many imponderables. These are, in no particular order:In 1415, Henry V of England attacked France. His first goal, the seizure of the fortified town of Harfleur, took much longer than expected. By the time the city's garrison surrendered, Henry had lost a sizable number of his troops to disease, probably cholera.\nNow, knowing that the king of France had sent a great host to drive the English from his realm, Henry's only hope—if he was to avoid the destruction of his army and his own capture and imprisonment—was to race all the way across northern France toward the safety of the English-held town of Calais.\nBut before he set off on this desperate march through miserable weather, he had to weaken his army even further by leaving enough men behind to defend Harfleur, the prize won at such great cost.\nFor a while the two armies played cat and mouse, but, eventually, near a village called Agincourt, the French managed to place their much larger force between the English and the road to Calais.\nBy this time the English force was on half-rations, so the soldiers that faced the French the next the morning (Oct. 25, 1415) were hungry, exhausted and riven by disease (it is believed that the dysentery was so bad among Henry's troops that some of them went into action that day sans culotte).\nLooking at the odds—a well-fed, armor-clad French army of at least 15,000 men against an English force of, at best, 7,000, all of them half-starved and some half-naked—it's easy to see why everyone expected a great slaughter of Englishmen.\nYet the English not only carried the day, they killed so many Frenchmen that it took that country's nobility nearly a century to recover its numbers and sort out the property transfers necessitated by so great a mortality.\nAuthorities disagree on the precise numbers, but there is no doubt that thousands of Frenchmen died that day, while contemporaneous accounts claim only 30 English dead.\nThousands vs. 30. You would have thought Henry V had machine guns at his disposal, not bows and arrows.\nAnd if such a lopsided English victory isn't enough to make you scratch your head in wonder, there's one final conundrum that never fails to intrigue me: despite numerous attempts to do so, no archaeological evidence of the battle has ever been found—no hastily dug graves, no broken sword hilts, no dented helmets, not even so much as a thrown horseshoe.\nDespite the fact that, for centuries to come, the British would celebrate the victory and the French lament it, as far as professional archaeology is concerned, it never took place.\nAnd so it was that, when I learned Michael Livingston, a professor at The Citadel, had written a new book about the battle, I immediately did two things: (1) I used the \"Suggest a Title\" option on the Talbot County Free Library's website to ask our acquisitions librarian to purchase a copy for Talbot's collection, and (2) using our inter-library loan system, I ordered a copy for myself from the Anne Arundel County Public Library.\nI won't give away any of his conclusions, but I can tell you Livingston's exhaustive research has led him to propose a new site for the location of the battle (which, if he's correct, should solve the missing artifacts dilemma) and an English battle plan that helps explain Henry's improbable victory without making the French look like fools.\nBut Livingston's book does more than just solve the many mysteries surrounding Agincourt.\nIt ends up being an extended lesson in not just history but the making of history: how we study the past; how, in telling and retelling it, various biases inevitably slip into the narrative and how our view of the past is just as inevitably colored by our present, the intellectual paradigm that structures our study.\nPerhaps just as interesting, and far more disturbing, the book—which spares none of the senses in describing close quarters combat between men wielding axes, hammers, halberds and flails—makes us wonder, yet again, how rational human beings can so willingly engage in war (it was the older men, the veterans who had already experienced such battles, who were the most eager that day to enter the fray).\nFinally, Livingston's \"Agincourt: Battle of the Scarred King\" is a good story, well told. I brought the thing home from the library on a Friday and finished reading it before the fire on Sunday afternoon.\nBy the time this column is published, the Talbot County Free Library will own its own copy of Livingston's book. You should be able to find it on the New Books shelf at 944.0254 LIVI. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Together with their daughter Quin Warner and son-in-law Andy Warner, they transformed the hotel into a thriving family business venture.\n\"Well, we don't know how to have dinner together and not talk about work. But it's enjoyable,\" Quin Warner said. \"We all have the same vision… we're fully ingrained. We love it. And we have ideas, and it's just how we're going to execute these ideas. We all balance each other out, too.\"\nQuin Warner functions as business manager, and Andy Warner acts as general manager. Together, they balance all the weddings and significant events that keep the hotel booked.\nThe recently renovated Oaks Hotel dates back to the 17th Century. The entire plot consisted of 740 acres, and over the years, the property transformed into a premier waterfront venue for wedding receptions.\nIncluded in the renovation were interior and exterior changes to the main building. An additional four cottages were built on the property, and over 200 mature trees were planted.\nBut most importantly, the hotel's owners said, they sought ways to improve accessibility. Scott Wagner explained that they wanted to provide ways for potential grandparents to enjoy the weddings and family reunions often booked on the property.\nThey installed an elevator, created accessible handicap rooms and renovated the dock to make it easier to use for everyone.\nTracy Wagner describes the vision for the hotel as being comfortable and a fun place to welcome guests and locals alike.\nAndy Warner said the community has embraced them, and they have enjoyed hosting events for locals, including holding Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, hosting burger nights and galas, and opening the restaurant and bar to locals on Wednesday and Thursday nights.\n\"We have the best burgers in town, by the way,\" Andy Warner said, beaming with pride.\nLast December, they hosted a Christmas party of between 350 and 400 people. Scott Wagner described the experience as akin to a reunion. Contractors, families, friends and people from every walk of life joined in the fun.\nOverall, the owners look forward to having guests discover the beauty of the Eastern Shore. Whether walking through St. Michaels and Oxford or biking through nature, there's something for everyone, they said.\n\"We've done this for you. We've done this for Talbot County,\" Tracy said. \"We've done this for the brides, for the parents of the bride. And we are proud of this. And we are proud that we've had this opportunity to bring this to Talbot County and to keep this historical place. We've given it a whole new life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A better option for promoting Chesapeake Bay tourism\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 827\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A consortium of five Maryland counties — Anne Arundel, Calvert, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's and Somerset, recently released results of a $250,000 feasibility study on a new Chesapeake Bay passenger ferry system.The study concludes that passenger-only ferries — not vehicle-carrying ferries — serving Annapolis, Baltimore and the Eastern Shore destinations of Easton, Cambridge, Rock Hall, Kent Narrows, St. Michaels, Oxford, Chestertown and Crisfield are feasible.\nMembers of the consortium and other supporters of this new ferry system are well intentioned. The ferry feasibility study looks good on paper.\nUpon closer scrutiny of the Aug. 24 executive summary of the consortium's feasibility study, there are a number of unanswered questions. There is also one alternative that should be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding further. The questions and alternative include:\nWhy does the consortium only have two Eastern Shore counties — Queen Anne's and Somerset?\nWho will pay for projected start-up costs for a base line system requiring at least $8 million in ferry boat acquisitions and up to $5 million in necessary infrastructure improvements such as docks, passenger shelters, restrooms and attraction shuttle services at system destinations before ferry operations can begin?\nWho will pay for projected $5 million in annual operating costs for a baseline system that will be only partially offset by the feasibility studies \"suggestion\" that 50,000 ferry passenger riders will generate $2.5 million in revenue in the first season of operation?\nWhat is this suggestion of 50,000 riders based on?\nWho will cover this deficit if passenger revenue is below projections?\nWhat assurances are there this new venture will not replicate the historical record of cost overruns during start up and post start overruns on new transportation projects?\nWhere do the 67% of individuals live, who responded to a consortium-sponsored survey who expressed interest in the ferry service?\nWhere do the 62% of community partners live and/or operate, who have expressed interest in engaging activities for visitors to and residents of proposed ferry destinations?\nWere survey respondents made fully aware that a new ferry system would not carry vehicles and would thus likely have a minimal impact at best on enormous amounts of vehicular traffic going to and from Ocean City every year?\nAre consortium partners and supporters planning on state or local or government funding, for start-up and post start-up operating expenses? If so, how much?\nAre they acknowledging the following current and projected fiscal realities in Maryland? The state and local governments in Maryland are facing significant challenges in funding current programs including the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (Kirwan Plan). Current projections are the state deficit will be $1 billion in 2026 and 2027, $3.5 billion in 2028, and $4 billion in 2029. Maryland also has a deficit in the state six-year transportation plan deficit that does not yet reflect the loss in toll revenue after the Key Bridge collapse and the yet to be finalized amount of state funding needed to rebuild that bridge. Earlier this week, the state proposed new cuts of cutting $1.3 billion from the six-year transportation plan after previous cuts of $ 3.3 billion to the plan a year ago, cuts that were partially restored by tapping the state's \"rainy day\" fund and increasing vehicle registration fees. Gov. Moore recently told Maryland Association of Counties Summer Conference attendees, all new state spending will be facing \"extreme scrutiny.\"\nIs it realistic to assume state and local funding for the launch and operation of a new Bay ferry service will be a priority or even considered in Annapolis or with local governments in the near future, if ever?\nHas the consortium and supporters of more ferry service on the Chesapeake Bay given serious evaluation of an alternative to meet the goal of a new ferry service to promote tourism that could also help an endangered Chesapeake Bay way of life to survive and hopefully thrive?\nThere are over 400 charter boats registered in Maryland.\nOperators of these charter boats have been and are dealing with extraordinary hardships due to new state regulations limiting the size and number of rockfish that can be caught by recreational fishing enthusiasts who historically come from within Maryland and beyond.\nCharter boats could be more heavily promoted by destination marketing organization in the Chesapeake Bay region for Bay pleasure cruises. Charter boats can take clients anywhere they want to go, whenever they want to go, and for as long or as short a time as they want to go.\nCharter boat operators also can provide data on the actual demand for Bay cruises that may or may not match data from the consortium's surveys on the demand for passenger ferry boats.\nThe next best step for the consortium is to meet with a representative group of charter boat captains to discuss their interest in, capacity for, and feasibility of providing more pleasure cruises on the bay. Charter boats could be a cost-effective alternative to a new, costly and unproven Chesapeake Bay passenger ferry system as the way to generate more tourism and economic benefits for the Eastern Shore and the entire Chesapeake Bay region. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories — instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects — be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" … I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" … If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" … The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lions move closer to first North Bayside title in program history\n\n April 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1285\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The walls of Queen Anne's County High's gymnasium are plastered with banners celebrating past champions in just about every sport.But with the exception of the banner commemorating head coach Dee Fisher's 200th career victory last year, girls tennis is not represented on the gym walls.\n\"Girls tennis doesn't have anything,\" said Lucy Taylor, Queen Anne's No. 1 singles player. \"Sometimes those posters are kind of behind (in being updated). And we joke that it's like a forgotten sport. But we're out here showing we can win stuff too.\"\nThe Lions have shown they can win quite often this year.\nIt started in the season-opener, when Queen Anne's ended Kent Island's impressive 102-match win streak against Bayside Conference competition. The Lions defeated the six-time defending Bayside champions again Friday by a 7-0 count, this one moving them within a victory of their first North Bayside title in school history.\n\"At the beginning of the season we had like an inter-squad scrimmage and that was like the best thing ever,\" Fisher said after his team improved to 11-1 overall, 9-0 North. \"Because when I matched them up they were just pushing each other.\"\nWhat has also helped is having players who have won conference or division titles in other sports this school year.\n\"I have volleyball players who had a great (Bayside title) team,\" Fisher said. \"Basketball players who had a great (North Bayside title) team. Field hockey players that had a great (Bayside championship) team. Soccer (which won the North Bayside). So I have a team of winners basically. They win at every sport they play. So it kind of trickled over to tennis.\"\nBut Fisher admitted he did not see this coming after graduating nine seniors last year, most of which made up his starting lineup.\n\"We had a full team of juniors and sophomores,\" Fisher said. \"So this was going to be my get-them-used-to-playing year. Next year would be the year.\n\"A lot of the players hadn't played doubles and singles,\" Fisher said of his team. \"So this was a chance to get their feet wet. But our program has a lot of girls, so I always try to build that up through exhibition. I'm always encouraging exhibition matches, lot of practice, and just having fun.\"\nIn the process, Fisher's get-them-used-to-playing year has turned into the get-them-used-to-winning year.\"\nQueen Anne's got an early start on that Friday, sweeping doubles play for a 3-0 lead. Lucy Taylor and sister Meg Taylor, who have lost only once this season, defeated Jamie Tranquill and Isabelle Gamez, 8-2 at No. 1. The No. 2 tandem of Hayden Legg and Marylee Kline put together a similar 8-2 result over Gianna Tamburo and Taylor Harding. Sydney Pinder and Kara Ringold completed the sweep with an 8-4 win over Grace Turner and Jasleen Paquer.\n\"Last year we lost, what, nine seniors?\" Lucy Taylor asked. \"Most of which were in the lineup. This year, Hayden and Marylee have both come so far, and they have been able to pick up big wins for us. The same with Sydney and Kara. I think it's just like, keep building on those skills we learned freshman year. It's just amazing how much everyone has grown.\"\nQueen Anne's lead continued to grow through singles play.\nMeg Taylor defeated Gamez, 8-4, at No. 2. Legg was an 8-4 winner over Tamburo, and Kline earned an 8-2 win over Harding.\nIn the marathon match of the afternoon, Lucy Taylor, who lost both her singles matches earlier in the week, fell behind 3-0 to Tranquill. This wasn't exactly anything new for the Lions' No. 1, who rallied from a 4-0 deficit to win when her and Tranquill met in the season-opener.\n\"I was just thinking, 'I've done this before. I can get it back,'\" Lucy Taylor said. \"I used the same mentality I did last time which is just like, one point at a time, one game at a time. And then I was able to build off of that.\"\nTaylor rallied to take an 8-7 lead, but Tranquill showed she too could battle back, pulling even at 8-8 to force a tiebreaker.\n\"This time was a little harder because we went back and forth so many times,\" said Taylor, who won the tiebreaker 9-7. \"This one really felt good.\"\nA win over visiting Easton on Tuesday or against Cambridge-South Dorchester on Wednesday clinches the division title for Queen Anne's.\nDo the Lions feel any pressure one victory shy of history?\n\"I think they don't think about it,\" Fisher said smiling. \"I think they just go out and just play hard and have fun. No. We really don't talk about it.\n\"This is our throw-away year,\" Fisher said, referring back to this being a season of preparation for next year. \"I don't know how to explain it. We just go with the flow.\"\nPrimarily an exhibition player, junior captain Sydnee Carr said it's been a joy to be on the ride toward a potential first division title.\n\"It's hard for me to speak on it because I'm typically an exhibition player,\" said Carr, who has won all her doubles matches when Fisher has inserted into the starting lineup. \"But it has been fun to watch everybody improve. Definitely Hayden and Lucy and Marylee. Just seeing them come out the past two years and improve in so many ways, and then be able to be in the starting lineup and excel is really fun to watch.\n\"Being on the field hockey team and being on the swim team, our teams have a lot of banners,\" Carr continued. \"So it will be fun to see my third sport be represented up on the wall.\"\nGIRLS LACROSSE\nSSPP 21, SALISBURY SCHOOL 3\nSALISBURY — Sophomore Caroline Ewing scored five goals and set up another, and senior Morgan Quade distributed nine assists and scored twice Friday, as Saints Peter and Paul won its 10th straight.\nEden Zimmerman had four goals and Kendall Kroniser (assist), Avery McCall (two assists) and Eryn Callahan (assist) each recorded hat tricks for the Sabres (10-1, 6-0 Eastern Shore Independent Athletic Conference).

New on the board are Randolph Moore and Walter Palmer, and staying on are Carolyn Spicher and Jo Ann Staples.With deep ancestral roots in the county, Walsh was elected president of the society in 1987. His mission was to preserve the history, stories and, if possible, structures within the county. Under his leadership, 47 structures were restored, with many serving as tourist destination sites.Treasurer Carolyn Spicher credited Walsh with the solid financial footing of $1.3 million in the treasury.Two donors presented paintings to the society.Caroline native Clarence B. Mollock of Preston brought his 1988 painting of the Mill Dam at Linchester, where he used to swim and fish.Candi Minner of Denton presented a painting of the old Caroline High School by Bill Greenly, a longtime member of the society.Society member Kathy Mackel, Walsh's longtime partner, presented the annual report in a slide show depicting the society's current work projects, including the renovation of the historic Denton Fire House as a heritage center.Diana Lapsley shared memories of Walsh in a tribute that concluded with a suggestion that the center be renamed the JOK Walsh Heritage Center.Calling it \"an important legacy,\" Lapsley said this last project Walsh worked on \"is to be an information research center, a meeting place, a further opportunity to illustrate all of the county's rich heritage, and also a place to help visitors and locals to explore, learn about and enjoy all the other Caroline County historical projects.\" Becoming emotional as she commemorated her friend's legacy, Lapsley said, \"I personally thank JOK for his friendship and enthusiasm, tenacity, bravery and generosity, as I know well that, even when busy and under pressure, he would take time to visit, entertain and look after his friends.\" \"My hope is that we will all continue to get the work done that he started,\" she said. Quoting her granddaughter when she learned of Walsh's passing, Lapsley said, \"Who is going to tell the story of Caroline County now?\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCaroline County native Clarence B.

And Hitler at the Reichstag, yet. What about Napoleon on the 18 Brumaire at Saint-Cloud in 1799? Oh, wait, Trump never conquered Europe nor invaded Russia like Napoleon, leading to the deaths of 6.5 million people.\nWhat about Stalin at the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in April 1923 in Moscow? Oh, that won't work either, since Stalin has been blamed for the deaths of 10 million people, maybe more, they don't know for sure. What about Mao at Tian'anmen on October 1, 1949? Oh no, because they now think that Mao and his policies may be responsible for 80 million fatalities; no one knows the exact amount.\nThe only similar number of deaths that we have had in America since Trump first won the 2016 election is the number of babies aborted, which is in the millions. But they don't count, do they? Plus abortion is not Trump's fault, although if Democrats did not love abortion they would find a way to blame him for it, as they do other things.\nSo please stop comparing Trump to a mass murderer like Hitler. It does not insult Trump because it is so absurd, but it does diminish the real victims of the real Nazis, whose bodies are still being recovered in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe.\nAs for the complaint about Trump's executive orders, what about all the executive orders given by Obama and Biden? So Democrat presidents can issue executive orders but when Trump does it somehow the Constitution is being violated? I say to all Democrats, especially to Gov. Wes Moore and his lament over the \"chaos\" in Washington (Star Democrat, Feb. 5), please focus on fixing the chaos your policies have caused in our schools and in our cities, where too often violence reigns.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Occasionally, the bidding will tell you -- as here. North's double of three clubs was for penalty, not takeout, as it would be today.This old deal features a truly incredible defense -- one of the most imaginative ever. The deal was reported by Frenchman Jacques Blaizot, who was sitting West. He was in the Palace of Da Lat, partnering Bao Dai, then the Emperor of French Indochina. (Later, the palace was in South Vietnam.)Defending against three no-trump, West led the club ace. How do you think the defense went?West opened with a cautious three clubs. North doubled for penalties, but South, with his distributional hand, wisely didn't pass. (Three clubs was unbeatable.) Then, when North bid three hearts, South thought he was facing a heart-club two-suiter. So, rather than look for a nonexistent spade fit, he settled for three no-trump.This is how Blaizot reported the play: \"I led the club ace and under the eyes of the panic-stricken spectators, Bao Dai discarded the diamond ace! I continued with the club queen and he discarded the spade ace! Immediately, silence filled the room. Discreetly, the spectators, struck with fright, got up and whispered into each other's ears. Then, little by little, a disquieting rumor spread through the palace: 'The emperor has gone mad. He threw away all of his aces.' But no! Bao Dai wasn't playing to lose.\"If the emperor had kept either of his aces, South could have established that suit without letting West on play. Now, though, West had to win a spade or diamond trick and could cash enough club winners to defeat the contract.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Specific costs include contributions to teacher pensions and the state Department of Assessments and Taxation.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said it's \"simply a poor and inappropriate strategy for resolving the very real state budget crisis.\"\nLesher noted Tuesday that Talbot County isn't seeing the worst of the cost shifts — Dorchester County may be looking at more than $3 million affected, he said.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he testified at a Senate budget committee meeting in Annapolis and talked with members of the governor's staff.\nPfeffer says Department of Legislative Services recommendations to double the costs for counties to pay toward teacher pensions is particularly alarming. For Dorchester, it would cost $1.1 million compared to the previously estimated $550,000.\nGov. Wes Moore has said solving the budget crisis is an \"enormous task\" only made more difficult by constraints from the federal government. At a Feb. 28 Senate budget committee hearing, he emphasized that the budget bill is nowhere near final.\n\"While I still remain locked in on the destination, I come in moving in partnership to be flexible on the journey,\" Moore said.\nCaroline County Commissioners President Travis Breeding said the county may lose $1.1 million in income tax revenue if Moore's tax cut plan is approved.\nMoore has maintained that giving middle-class families tax relief is a critical component to the budget and state's economic growth plan.\n\"Marylanders are being squeezed. They're being squeezed by rising prices,\" Moore said Feb. 28. \"They're being squeezed by the rising cost of groceries, they're being squeezed by the rising cost of energy.\"\nAs session continues, Breeding says Caroline County has representatives in Annapolis fighting for relief from the potential cost shifts.\n\"We have a lot of heartburn with the proposed budget,\" Breeding said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Cambridge is working:' city staff talks about plans at Council retreat\n\n February 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 682\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Cambridge City Council and city staff looked both back into the past and forward into the future at a Council retreat Feb. 5.At the retreat, city officials reviewed the city's goals — which were determined a year ago — talking about the progress that has been made and what still needs to be done.\nThe first half of the meeting was dedicated to short presentations by city department heads, detailing the programs, initiatives and projects that they think contribute to the city's goals. The department heads talked about programs and projects that have already been started or completed, as well as those that are still in the works.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout called the written reports the department heads prepared, along with their presentations, \"excellent.\"\n\"Turning Cambridge around is not something that is done on a dime or is done in a month, or six months, or a year or even many years,\" he said. \"It is hard work that the staff has clearly put itself to — not only in preparing these documents, but in showing us what has been happening over this past year and what we look forward to in the coming months.\"\nThe city's goals, established last year, are to:\nBe inclusive, consistent and fair retaining, assisting and attracting businesses with consistently applied rules and processes.Improve the City of Cambridge's organizational efficiencies and effectiveness.Create a more beautiful City with better and healthier housing, improved gateways, a vibrant downtown and a sense of pride within the City staff and the community as a whole.Engage Cambridge's youth and foster meaningful work for young adults.Develop improved infrastructure, long-term projects and capital plans, including the preservation and restoration of the old City Hall structure at 307 Gay Street by 2026.\nThe initiatives and projects brought up by department heads at the meeting ranged from upgrades to the city's camera systems and sidewalks to improving housing through the Homeownership Works pilot program and the creation of a land bank.\nCity Manager Tom Carroll said the city is in the process of implementing the government software, OpenGov. City staff hope this software will improve efficiency and accuracy when it comes to things like code enforcement, work orders and permitting.\nCity Engineer Carl \"Bucky\" Jackson talked about upcoming projects to resolve sewer issues in the city. These projects include the replacement of the West End sewer, located in the lowest lying area of the city at Water Street and Hambrooks Boulevard, and the replacement of the Trenton Street Pump Station.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd talked about its priorities with community-oriented policing and plans for focusing more attention on high-crime areas. Todd also talked about goals to implement more technology in policing. He mentioned wanting to start a drone program.\nRescue Fire Company Chief Adam Pritchett talked about recruitment being a focus this year. He said the fire company wants to start its cadet program back up and get back into schools to try to recruit the next generation of firefighters.\nAfter the presentations, Rideout and commissioners discussed how to make these efforts known to residents.\n\"How do we get this information out to everyone else so they understand all the complexities, all the hard work that goes into this on some kind of a simplified basis?\" Rideout asked. \"Because I think its important for the community to become more engaged and to have a better understanding so that maybe they won't come and start picking on this one little thing when they know there's so much more that's being done.\"\nCommission President Lajan Cephas said the phrase \"Cambridge is working\" comes to her mind when thinking about how to approach this.\n\"Because I know everything is working,\" she said. \"We have a great city. We have great department heads, great employees, a great city manager. ... I guess to answer (Rideout's) question, is maybe if we have some sort of movement that says 'Cambridge is working.'\"\nCephas said its important that the council recognizes city staff is short-handed and overworked.\n\"So I think this year should be more of a year of trying to complete what we've started in the previous couple of years,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ironman brings economic boost to Cambridge\n\n September 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Cambridge residents may have noticed it has been trickier getting around this past week.Traffic has increased, reservations at their favorite restaurant are difficult to get and all hotels and Airbnb's from Salisbury to Annapolis are filled, according to Operations Manager at the Ironman Angie Hengst.\n1,250 athletes who will be participating in the Maryland Ironman on Saturday began making their way to Cambridge on Monday to preview the courses, enjoy their welcoming events and attend athlete briefings.\n\"Driving around town, it's about three times as busy as you would normally see it,\" Hengst said.\nA few years ago, the Ironman did an economic impact study on Cambridge and Dorchester Counting post-event that discovered the event has a $7.14 million impact on the community, Hengst said. This number may have increased since the study.\nThis is the 11th annual Maryland Ironman, an extreme triathlon race that requires approximately 1,200 volunteers to pull off. The Ironman Foundation has grant funding available for local nonprofits that volunteer for the race, per this year's Race Director Brian Snow.\n\"We have over $40,000 in nonprofit money, and it goes to volunteers and groups to help stimulate the economy with people participating as volunteers,\" Snow said.\nBoth Hengst and Snow said Friday that they were still looking for volunteers for Saturday's big race.\nThe race will include a 2.4-mile swim in the Choptank River in between Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh and the Yacht Club, finishing at the boat ramp at Gerry Boyle Park. Next, there will be a 112-mile bike ride through Dorchester County and the scenic Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. The race will finish with a 26.2-mile run through historic downtown Cambridge and beyond.\nSnow said athletes from all 50 states and over 30 countries will be participating on Saturday. He said every athlete generally comes with one other person considering the intensity of the race.\nBoth Snow and Hengst expressed their gratitude to the volunteers and residents of Cambridge and Dorchester County for being gracious hosts.\n\"I do want to put a huge thank you out to the community, you know, Cambridge, Dorchester County, everyone, for being so welcoming and supportive of the athletes,\" Hengst said.\n\"We're one of the smaller towns that hosts an event of this size, and we couldn't do it without the community's support. The athletes always comment about how nice everyone is and how welcoming it is here,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Salt of the earth\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: REV. DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s Methodist Church, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 272\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Matthew 5:13 recounts Jesus' words, \"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under peoples' feet.\"In the ancient world, salt had many functions. Of course, we know salt was widely used as a food preservative. It did not simply sit on the table waiting to cheer up a dull meal. It was also used as a \"rub\" of sorts for newborns (check out Ezekiel 16:4).\nStrictly speaking, salt cannot lose its saltiness because it (sodium chloride) is a stable compound. So, what is Jesus alluding to with this illustration?\nOne possibility is that the Lord is referring to the preservative function of salt — Christians are to live and act in the world to prevent its moral degeneration. But it has more than the negative function of stopping the world's deterioration.\nBy speaking and living the gospel, believers will improve the societies in which they live. That is, we sprinkle the salt of the gospel onto the world.\nChristians will turn the world aright when they submit to Christ. They should have no small ambitions; the whole earth will change through their salty influence. What was true for the first disciples is also true for us. We can serve Christ by applying the salt of anointed witness and service to the needs in our own locales.\nPray that we continue to salt our community with the salt of Christ's shed blood, that others may experience the true depth of God's life-preserving, regenerative power and not just the flavor of salt. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So let's gather into a huddle, wrap our arms around one another and take a collective deep breath.Dear Cheapskate: My comment is in response to \"Where to Keep Money for Mom?\" and Bonita in South Dakota, who was looking for input on how to invest $10,000 for her 62-year-old mother who has no savings, no life insurance and lives on disability.I would recommend they go to any funeral home and work with the person there who handles prepaid funerals.Essentially, you are purchasing an insurance policy to cover the funeral costs.We did this for my dad before he moved into a longterm care facility, which was going to drain his remaining assets to $0. A prepaid funeral policy is excluded from the asset base, is protected once the assets are gone and a person goes on medical assistance.With all the other drama that comes with aging parents, it is nice for my sister and me to know that the end is covered and won't create another drain/strain on everything. - Molly Dear Molly: Thanks for this wise advice. In fact, many elder law attorneys advise prepayment as a way to invest in assets that will not be countable by Medicaid or SSI.However, I want my readers to know that there are pitfalls on the road to prepaid end-of-life arrangements, which they need to know about in order to avoid falling into them.

A \"Day of Dance\" is one of the many gifts that Carole Cascio left to the community.On Saturday, Feb. 24, dancers, ages 12 and up, filled the Decker Theatre in the Gibson Center at Washington College in Chestertown for a free community event hosted by the Carole Cascio Fund for Mind and Movement Dance Connections.\nUpon arrival, registered dancers signed in and received a bag full of healthy drinks and snacks. All dancers were invited to participate in four master classes taught by special guest artists Kristi Schaffner (ballet) with piano accompanist Joann Moorer, Renee Gerardo (modern dance), Adrienne Kraus Latanishen (hip hop), and Melinda Bloomquist (composition/choreography).\nThis was the fourth \"Day of Dance\" sponsored by the fund. Both Chesapeake College and Washington College have offered their theaters to host these events.\nEach \"Day of Dance\" showcases different artists and a variety of dance styles with a mission of the Fund, \"to introduce students of all ages and levels to connecting mind, movement and dance, and to support developing artistry in young people through choreography and dance.\"\nLocally, Cascio was known as a beautiful artist for both watercolor and pottery, but many did not know about her former dancing career.\nPeter Pucci, a former dance student of Cascio, said, \"It was because of Carole that I became a professional dancer, a choreographer, a movement director, an artistic director, a professor of dance and composition, a dance filmmaker, a producer, a mentor to young dancers and finally the executive director of the Carole Cascio Fund at Carole's request.\"\nIn addition to dance and creating art, Cascio also taught Pilates at the Kent Island Senior Center in Stevensville and at Chesapeake College for many years. With a heart for creating and a love for the arts, Cascio was an inspiration to countless people.\n\"Carole and I had many conversations over the last five years of her life about how to bring dance into her community, to elementary schools, middle schools, high schools and to Chesapeake College,\" Pucci said. \"They were fun, lively conversations with all kinds of ideas being tossed about. Little did I know then that she was preparing me for the job of directing her foundation. It is truly a full circle endeavor for me and, in the great tradition of modern dancers, of giving back to the community just as she did to hundreds of dancers over her career.\"\nTo honor Cascio's dreams of bringing dance into the schools, Pucci is actively working with Queen Anne's County Public Schools to encourage and enhance the dance programs at the middle and high schools. To date, the Cascio Fund has planned, sponsored and held many dance classes, including a combined hip hop master class with Queen Anne's County High School dancers and with students from Centreville Middle School.\nThe Fund also brought a four-century-old dance style and India Dance Teachers Deepti Mukund Navile, Gowrie Velayudhapillai and Tulsi Rughoonundun to teach dance workshops at Kent Island and Queen Anne's County high schools.\nOn Friday, March 8, there will be a free performance courtesy of the Carole Cascio Fund by the New York Dance Project from New York City at the YMCA in Centerville from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. Seating opens at 5 p.m. For more information, visit newyorkdanceproject.org/programs/the-company.\nPucci shared this performance will be \"very serendipitous\" as Cascio donated the funds to create the new pickleball courts at the YMCA where the dancers will be performing. Before this event, there will also be a free ballet masterclass at QACHS for all dancers 12 and up. Pre-registration is required. See the website for more information.\nFor more information or to support the Carole Cascio Fund for Mind Movement Dance Connections, visit carolecasciofund.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay cleanup at a crossroads: new path or stay the course?\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEREMY COX Bay Journal | Section: State News \n \n 1014\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the Chesapeake Bay cleanup's leaders close in on a revised working agreement, many of the effort's most influential supporters are endorsing a major thematic shift: putting less emphasis on improving the estuary's seldom-seen deep waters and more on helping people and living resources in the Bay watershed.\"This is an opportunity for our movement to understand our successes and failures, and adjust accordingly,\" said Kate Fritz, CEO of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, in a letter to the Chesapeake Bay Program, the multi-state and federal partnership in charge of reviving the Bay. \"This means … intentionally including people and living resources at the center of the partnership's work.\"\nThat closely aligns with the recommendations of the Bay Program team that was tasked with drafting an update of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. A draft was released for public feedback on July 1.\nThe team urged the program to \"better incentivize practices that maximize benefits to living resources and people.\" This, they argued, could be accomplished largely through actions that target water quality improvements — long the effort's central focus — but only if local community concerns take precedent.\nMore than 80 people and organizations submitted comments on the draft agreement by the Aug. 30 deadline. The Chesapeake Executive Council — the governors of the six watershed states, mayor of the District of Columbia, chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency — is set to vote on a final draft during its annual meeting in December.\nThe revised agreement is intended to serve as a top-line strategy for cleaning up the Bay and its 64,000-square-mile drainage basin beyond 2025, when the deadline for goals in the current agreement expires.\nFor decades, the partnership has centered its work on reducing nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Bay. The main goal has been to shrink the annual \"dead zones,\" pockets of oxygen-starved water in the estuary's deepest waters where aquatic creatures struggle to survive.\nDespite billions of dollars invested in the effort, pollution reductions have been modest and slow in coming, according to the Bay Program's own calculations. Some advocates and scientists fear that the cleanup risks falling out of favor with the public if it doesn't shift toward more visible quests, such as restoring shallow waters along the edge of the Bay and its tributaries.\n\"Without renewed attention to those things that matter the most to people, we run the risk of leaving potential living resource benefits unaddressed and potentially losing public support for our efforts,\" wrote Larry Sanford, chair of the Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), on behalf of the panel.\nBut in remarks to STAC on Sept. 12, Sanford, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, described the new draft agreement as a \"compromise\" between two factions: those seeking a pronounced change in direction and those who want to stay the course.\nFor his part, Sanford said the program needs to maintain much of its existing work but also \"go back to the original reason for the Bay Program, and that was what was happening to the living resources.\"\nIf that recalibration is to move forward, it will have to survive a big test later this fall when the agreement goes before the Principals' Staff Committee — senior officials from the Bay states and DC, who sounded a note of caution about that approach when they met in March.\nMeeting water quality goals is a legal requirement, enforced by the EPA. The committee appeared concerned that de-stressing that goal could lead to potential lawsuits. Several members at the time also said they believed that those authoring the revised agreement had gone beyond what they had been authorized to do.\nA group of agricultural industry groups in Virginia, including the Virginia Farm Bureau, signed on to a letter that said they \"appreciate\" the draft's call to better address climate change and public engagement. But they are concerned that such measures would \"change the original intent and shared goals\" of the 2014 agreement. The state in its current two-year budget has set aside a record $207 million to reduce farm-based pollution.\nMeanwhile, several environmental groups touted how reorienting the program toward people and living creatures would support other important goals. Much could be achieved, for example, through tougher enforcement of state and federal water pollution control laws, according to a letter signed by Waterkeepers Chesapeake and several local waterkeepers.\n\"While the status quo elevates considerations of nutrient pollutants and the dissolved oxygen levels in the mainstem of the Bay, the path forward must elevate the role that enforcement of illegal pollution from point sources has on protecting humans and wildlife from toxic and carcinogenic substances,\" the waterkeepers said.\nThe needs of people and wildlife will be difficult to meet without more land conservation, said the Chesapeake Conservation Partnership, an alliance of land trusts and related organizations. Bay leaders, they added, should elevate land conservation to stand as a \"key guiding pillar\" along those already on that top tier: science, restoration and partnership.\nThe document being readied for the Executive Council's approval this December isn't the final revised agreement but rather a framework for a more detailed compact to be worked out in the future. The current draft doesn't call for a full revision of the agreement until the council meets in 2026.\nSeveral commenters urged leadership to put the finalized agreement on a faster schedule. To wait until late 2026 could lead to a pause or slowdown in oyster restoration activities in key Bay tributaries, said Oyster Recovery Partnership Executive Director H. Ward Slacum. It should be ready by the end of 2025 instead, he said.\nA group of about 40 retired Bay scientists and former public officials also weighed in. The coalition, calling itself \"Chesapeake Bay Program Veterans,\" echoed the push to have the revisions in place in 2025.\nAnd the program should look at the problems and benefits that arise from local, state and federal greenhouse gas reduction goals, they said. They suggested that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, for example, is likely to reduce nitrogen pollution that enters Bay waters from the atmosphere. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Next phase of Oxford's Strand Beach Project poses funding hurdle\n\n October 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 262\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Phase one of the Strand Beach Project has been completed, but the prospect of phase two is daunting for the town and its residents.The first phase was turbulent. Residents, commissioners and town staff were frustrated with the duration, expense and results of the project.\nFunding for phase one came from the state and Department of Natural Resources. Currently, there is no additional funding for future phases of the project.\nPhase two will cover stormwater mitigation, an Americans with Disabilities Act access ramp over the dune and bulkhead improvements.\n\"We're looking at funding options with the state to mitigate the stormwater on the roadway as well as town internal funds, which it's going to be likely that we're going to have to look at that, especially with mitigating the stormwater on the roadway and that failing bulkhead,\" Wahl said.\nEngineering work is underway to design stormwater mitigation, like removing standing water from the roadway, creating a swale through the parking lot to channel water away and improving the failing bulkhead.\nThe standing water between the beach access point and the parking lot, known through town as the \"perma-puddle,\" can be seen on sunny days and grows even more after a storm.\nIn addition, there's no ADA compliant entrance to the beach area.\nThese have been hot topics at recent town commissioner meetings. Commissioner Dave Donovan said it has been on the agenda every meeting for the past two months.\nOnce plans for the second phase of the project are ready, the town will seek permits. Whal said commissioners are unlikely to approve another contract with Underwood & Associates. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Escape or die - BI: 'Kidnapped, chained' woman escaped from cell built inside home\n\n August 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Molly O Brien; Herald & News | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 932\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An Oregon man faces interstate kidnapping charges after a woman - who police say was \"kidnapped, chained (and) sexually assaulted\" - escaped from a sound-proof, cinderblock cell constructed in the suspect's garage.Negasi Zuberi, 29, rented a house in the 1300 block of North Eldorado in Klamath Falls, Oregon, with his wife and two children, Klamath Falls Police Chief Rob Dentinger told the Herald & News. Klamath Falls is in southern Oregon near the California border.\"This woman was kidnapped, chained, sexually assaulted and locked in a cinderblock cell,\" Stephanie Shark, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Portland field office, said in a news release.\"We have identified three additional victims from other states where (Zuberi) has lived,\" Shark told the Herald & News.Information on the victims has not yet been released as the investigation is ongoing, Shark said.Zuberi is confirmed to have lived in 12 different states over the past decade.\"Those states could include: California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Alabama, and Nevada,\" the FBI said in a statement.The suspect's residence on North Eldorado Drive was rented to him by Klamath Falls Mayor Carol Westfall and her husband, Kevin, who own the house.The mayor told the Herald & News that she and her husband rented the property to Zuberi and his two children six months ago. There was no mention of a wife or roommates on the lease, Westfall said.According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S.District Court in Oregon, Zuberi solicited the woman, identified only as Adult Victim 1, in the early morning hours of July 15 to engage in prostitution along Aurora Avenue in Seattle, an area known for sex work.Afterward, Zuberi told the woman he was an undercover officer, showed her a badge, pointed a stun gun at her, and placed her in handcuffs and leg irons before putting her in the back of his vehicle, the complaint says.The suspect then drove the victim 450 miles to his home in Klamath Falls, sexually assaulting the victim during the trip, according to the FBI and federal prosecutors.A news release from FBI's Portland office said after arriving at his home, the victim was moved into a cinderblock cell constructed in Zuberi's garage. A metal door made it so the victim could not open the door from inside the structure.\"Once Zuberi left, the victim says she repeatedly banged on the door and was able to break the door open and escape the room,\" the release said.She said after she was moved to the cell, Zuberi said he was leaving \"to do paperwork.\" The victim \"briefly slept and awoke to the realization she would likely die if she did not attempt to escape the room.\" Punching the metal door, she managed to break some of the welded joints and create an opening big enough to climb through, Klamath Falls Police Capt. Rob Reynolds said at the news conference.\"When she was trying to escape the cell itself, she repeatedly punched the door with her own hands,\" Reynolds said. \"She had several lacerations along her knuckles.\" In Zuberi's garage, the victim managed to break into the suspect's vehicle and grab a handgun. She then escaped to the street, climbing over a wooden fence on which investigators found blood.The victim flagged down a passing motorist who helped her notify the police and the motorist transported her to the emergency room at Sky Lakes Medical Center.\"Her quick thinking and will to survive may have saved other women from a similar nightmare,\" Shark said in the news release.Evidence found at the suspect's residence included handwritten notes, one of which was titled \"Operation Take Over.\" Entries on the bulleted list included \"Leave phone at home\" and \"Make sure they don't' have a bunch of ppl in their life. You don't want any type of investigation.\" Investigators also found a handwritten document with a sketch for an underground structure using concrete blocks, foam insulation and waterproof concrete.After the victim's escape, Zuberi ran with his wife and two children to Reno, Nev.The criminal complaint said Zuberi and his family were located by two Nevada State Patrol officers in a Walmart parking lot the following afternoon, July 16.He was in his car holding one of his children in the front seat while talking to his wife, who was standing outside the vehicle. The complaint said Zuberi initially refused to get out of the car and attempted to cut himself with a sharp object which led to profuse bleeding. Zuberi also attempted to destroy his phone but eventually surrendered.The child was reported unharmed.The mayor said there were no indications of Zuberi's criminal activity.\"We had service people going there, and he would invite us in,\" Westfall said. \"It was incredibly brazen.\" \"He came into this town, but it's over for him,\" she added.The U.S. Attorney's Office for Oregon said the Klamath Falls man had been indicted on kidnapping and sexual assault charges.\"Zuberi, 29, also known as Sakima, Justin Hyche, and Justin Kouassi, has been charged with interstate kidnapping and transporting an individual across state lines with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement. \n \n Caption: FBI\n \nA man renting a home from the mayor of an Oregon town built a \"cinderblock cell\" and allegedly held a kidnapped and chained woman captive before her escape, according to FBI.\n \nFBI\n \nThe FBI says a kidnapped woman escaped from a cell (pictured) built inside an Oregon home.\n \nMOLLY O'BRIEN/HERA LD & NEWS\n \nThis is the house in the 1300 block of North Eldorado Avenue where Negasi Zuberi, 29, allegedly held a woman in a cinderblock cell in the garage. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The 2023 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race has finally arrived, with all the action broadcast live on NBC from the Phoenix International Raceway in Avondale, Arizona, Sunday, Nov. 5.After a regular season that saw veteran racer Martin Truex Jr. battling it out with rising star William Byron and Kyle Larson, the three racers have continued fighting for the top spot on the podium.Still among the favorites to hoist the Bill France Trophy in Phoenix, Truex Jr. managed to keep himself above the cut line in the Round of 8, placing ninth at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and achieving only his first top-10 finish in the playoffs. This came at the end of a disastrous pit strategy that almost looked to be the end for the No. 19 car.

Band Leader Matt Fullerton keeps all the moving pieces in order.The band brought its music to Thompson Park on Nov. 9 during the Waterfowl Festival, and band members commanded a range from flutes to thundering drums.\nBut the most significant diversity the band exhibits is not in its musical abilities, but in the ages of its members.\nMembers of the band range from high schoolers to those in their upper 70s. There are people from all different walks of life who come together to make music.\n\"We do this because we love music. If nothing else it is therapy. No, it is a lot of fun,\" Fullerton said.\nFullerton has been conducting since 1975 and has a masters in music. He taught the band at Easton Middle school for 30 years. He said he can play most of the instruments in the band.\nTracie Thomas, who plays clarinet, has been in the band since its founding in 2009.\n\"One of the best parts is getting to play with my old musical director from middle school, Matt Fullerton,\" she said. \"Just being able to play is the best part. We generally have a season, and we will have a repertoire for the season that we select for each concert. Of course we already have Christmas music out. We have started rehearsing for that.\"\nShe said they have everything from jazzy Christmas to sleigh ride Christmas music.\n\"We really try hard to be a part of the community. Our band is here to serve other nonprofits like we are today. Every concert we have played is no charge and often raising money for another organization. Everybody here is volunteering their time,\" Thomas said.\nThere was also a vast expanse of musical choices on display at the Nov. 9 concert, including a theme from the Disney film Fantasia \"Night On Bald Mountain,\" a medley of computer gaming songs, a march and a hoedown.\n\"It includes themes from Assassin 33, 'Bratja' from Full Metal Alchemist, 'Dragon Born' from Skyrims, 'Sadness and Sorrow' from Naruto and 'Baba Yetu' from Civilization 4,\" Fullerton said of the gaming medley.\nHe noted that Hollywood used to produce most music, but the successful gaming industry is paying composers to make the digital worlds come alive.\n\"The same backing that creates that, as they do for themes for movies. It is possible that more people hear these than some of the pieces more than some of the movie themes,\" Fullerton said.\nOf course the band also played a crisp \"Star Spangled Banner\" and got the crowd on their feet.\nThey practice at the Easton High band room every Tuesday at 7 p.m. They always looking for new players, even if they haven't dusted off their tuba in 10 years.

I am sure they were not fired for cause. They were fired because Elon Musk was given authority to fire government employees, and he appears to get his gets kicks doing that. (See his chainsaw antics at CPAC.)\nWhere are those two fired scientists going to get private sector jobs? As reported in the Chesapeake Bay Journal March 2025, Trump is destroying all Bay protection agencies. Musk is firing federal scientists everywhere. Will Harris name some private companies that are going to take over protection of the Chesapeake Bay? Tesla? Starlink? Meta? Amazon? Maybe the two Oxford scientists can get jobs at an Amazon warehouse.\nJobs for the thousands of employees working for Veterans Affairs have been targeted for firing. People have been fired from security agencies that protect us from Russia. What companies are going to do that work? United Heath Care? Pfizer? Maybe each person buying Trump's gold card for $5 million to enter the U.S. will be required to adopt two veterans and assign one person to provide cybersecurity for America.\nMr. Harris's answer that private sector jobs will fulfill these requirements is a tragic joke.\nMr. Harris is also quoted as saying what an honor it was for him to sit next to the leader of the free world. That can't be Trump. He directed the U.S. to vote with North Korea, Iran and Russia denying a resolution supporting Ukraine. A prominent Republican of old called North Korea and Iran part of the \"Axis of Evil.\" The free world, they ain't.\nMany countries in the free world are at economic war with us. Our free world friends, such as Canada, are being courted by China to get themselves out of Trump's toxic world order.\nThe free world is divorcing us, and it seems everyone knows that except Mr. Harris.\nIf you disagree with Musk disemboweling the government while gleefully prancing around and ruining lives, and you disagree with Trump catering to Putin while making economic war against allies, vote Harris out in 2026.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Earlier this week Matt Neff, the museum's curator of estuarine biology, introduced the new tank inhabitants, including four cownose rays.It was about eight years ago that an environmental group called Showing Animals Respect and Kindness — or SHARK — raised awareness about a local event at which cownose rays were clubbed to death for sport.\nNeff, who said he has had a love for all of nature's creatures since he was a small child, dismissed reports that the cownose rays, which are prevalent in the Chesapeake Bay region during the warm weather months, are pesky and invasive.\nRecently, Neff and other museum personnel traveled to an aquarium in Kansas City, Mo., and returned with the cownose rays, along with some Atlantic rays and skates. The creatures were kept in an aquarium during the 22½ hour trip back to Maryland.\nNeff explained that the Kansas City aquarium was the only institute that responded to Calvert Marine Museum's request for cownose rays \"when we had a need for animals to exhibit.\"\nThe cownose rays, all male, seem to be getting along fine in the circular tank at the museum with the other local waterway denizens.\n\"They're pretty docile,\" Neff said, adding that the rays \"were born in captivity.\"\nNeff, who grew up in the Mid-Atlantic area and went to college in New York, majoring in biology, has previously worked at a nature center and at the National Zoo.\nOf his job at the local marine museum he said, \"I do like that we only have native species here.\"\nNeff also showed off one of the museum's newest exhibits, a pair of eastern hellbenders, the largest salamander in North America. However, the hellbender, first discovered in 1803, can no longer be found in the Chesapeake Bay region.\nThe eastern hellbender can grow as long as 29 inches and weigh up to 5.5 pounds.\n\"It's kind of a fascinating animal,\" Neff said, noting that some of the factors, including development and pollution, \"ended up being a perfect storm\" and put the hellbender's population in peril.\nBonnie Farmer, the museum's communications and marketing coordinator, confirmed that the annual Sharkfest is coming up at the Solomons facility on July 13. The extremely popular event will feature live sharks for viewing at Corbin Pavilion. It's recommended that anyone wanting to attend Sharkfest 2024 purchase tickets in advance since the museum has limited capacity.\nFor more information about the Calvert Marine Museum, go to calvertmarinemuseum.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's been a lot of tremendous players, a lot of great assistant coaches, administration. A lot of people have helped me along the way.\n\"It's been an amazing journey,\" continued Hosler, now in his 13th season at the helm. \"We have great kids. They come out and they work hard every year. We graduate good kids, and good kids fill their shoes. So it's a good place to be. If it wasn't I wouldn't have lasted this long.\"\nWith their fourth win in five games, the Lions (5-3 overall, 5-0 North Bayside) remained in first place in the division via their fourth one-goal win of the season.\n\"It's always a little stressful,\" Hosler said of senior night. \"We didn't finish the ball, which makes it difficult. We finish a couple more early (chances) and it would be a different game. But we don't put the ball in the back of the net and it becomes a struggle.\"\nQueen Anne's got four corner-kick chances in the opening 15 minutes but couldn't convert. And though the Lions controlled possession for much of the first half, the Eagles (4-4-1, 1-4-1) found openings and opportunities, the biggest coming with 26 minutes, 18 seconds remaining, when Christian Chase drilled a strike off the crossbar.\nThe Lions cranked up the intensity on the offensive end, with James Rath sending a pair of shots on goal that North Dorchester keeper Jayden Coleman stopped. But with just under 18 minutes left before half, the Lions worked the ball down the right side and over to Kendall, who steered a left-footed shot past Coleman for a 1-0 lead.\n\"We had good pressure,\" Eagles head coach Gabe Guzman said. \"It's one of those nights where things don't fall your way and you have to live with the results. Unfortunately, we had one mistake in the back end.\"\nQueen Anne's continued building chances toward padding its lead in the second half. Coleman stopped Trey Moore's header with 27:27 to go. Kendall was denied with 13:30 remaining and Rath unloaded a drive wide left 2 minutes later.\nNorth Dorchester pushed into the Lions end in the final 5 minutes in a bid for the equalizer. Senior captain Chris Sanchez, who booted a number of long clears and balls into the Queen Anne's end throughout the game, drove a direct kick wide left with a little over 5 minutes left. The Eagles got a corner with 3 minutes to go, but couldn't muster a shot.\nAbout a minute later, the Eagles sent a through ball into the box. But Lions sophomore keeper Braeden Livingston sprinted off his line and scooped the ball before anyone else could get a touch.\n\"It makes it stressful,\" Hosler said of his team's one-goal wins. \"But hey, we're playing well. We're still undefeated in the North. And I'm proud of the way we grind. It's not pretty. We're not finishing as many opportunities as we would like, but we keep grinding. We keep fighting. And we find a way to win.\"\nGuzman also liked his team's fight, and with a little work, hopes to be a force in the Class 1A East playoffs.\n\"We're still working things out,\" said Guzman, whose team is 4-1-1 against 1A competition this season. \"Finishing is still a little bit of an issue. It's a work in progress. Hopefully come playoff time we won't have that issue.\n\"Kudos to them,\" Guzman added of Hosler and Queen Anne's. \"Hundredth win. That's a wonderful feat. Hopefully one day I'll be there. But they did their job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "EPA announces historic funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 576\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that $206 million in funding will be allocated towards projects aimed at continuing the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.The historic levels of funding reflect the Biden administration's increased investments in environmental programs and infrastructure projects.\n\"For a long time, the EPA's budget has been so small, roughly about $10 billion a year,\" EPA Assistant Deputy Administrator Mark Rupp said during a ceremony at the recently-built Lubber Run Community Center here. \"Between the\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, there's now over $100 billion flowing through our agency, and it really has been a game changer.\"\nWith $96 million of the funds coming from President Joe Biden's so-called \"Investing in America\" agenda alone, the announcement marked the largest single contribution to the Chesapeake Bay Program in its 41-year history.\nMaryland is expected to receive over $14 million from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's share of the funds, which in turn makes up 40 individual grant projects.\nGrant recipients include the Baltimore Tree Trust, which plans to educate city residents about planting trees in their communities.\nThe Severn River Association will be another recipient. The organization intends to increase and improve stormwater treatment practices on the Severn River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis.\n\"Agendas matter, elected officials matter, vision matters,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) said. \"For the sake of the country, thank God we have the 117th Congress and Joe Biden to sign those bills into law.\"\nAttending the ceremony were not only federal officials and members of Congress but also legislators from state and local governments around the Chesapeake Bay.\nLibby Garvey, chair of the Arlington County Board, said funds are going to be used in her community on a small tributary called Grandma's Creek.\n\"(The Grandma's Creek project) is a great example of community involvement and advocacy for a beloved neighborhood stream,\" Garvey said. \"This project is going to propose the installation of rain gardens to better manage stormwater and increase the protection of the creek.\"\nIn addition to rain gardens, the Arlington community will also have the opportunity to participate in organized tree plantings and pop-up educational events centered around nature, Garvey said. The funds for these projects will be derived from the Small Watershed Grants Program, one of three grant programs administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which is to receive $193 million of the $206 million.\nThe NFWF already has announced it will be giving $1 million to farmers in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, with the intention of implementing high-priority conservation practices that improve water quality.\n\"There are 40,000 farms in Pennsylvania, and many of them contribute nutrients and sediment to the bay,\" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virginia) said. \"So anything we can do to get Pennsylvania on board with Maryland, Virginia and Delaware will be incredibly important.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Trust, another non-profit grant-making organization, will receive the remaining $13 million from the EPA. The trust will use the money to assist local organizations involved with improving the bay.\nThis could include providing operational infrastructure like computers and other hardware, or funding employee training and professional development sessions.\n\"We have to do better on agricultural runoff, and we have to do better on stormwater runoff. We do well on sewage treatment and on other point source pollution,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) told Capital News Service. \"This $200 million is going to be heavily focused on grants that focus on non-point sources, and we should continue to see significant improvements.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The town of Denton was the lone town to make a request this year.\nHere are the requests made by Caroline County:\nLocal Legislative Requests\nThe county made a request that the state allow the county to designate a newspaper of record. A paper of record is the paper in a county that is designated by a government or entity to publish official notices, laws and public information.\nBond Bills\nDenton is requesting a bond upgrade for the town's wastewater treatment facility. According to the county's request, the facility's \"sludge drying system is nearing the end of its usable life and requires replacement. A Preliminary Engineering Study identified the best upgrade alternative, with an estimated cost exceeding $8 million.\"\nThe town applied for grants for three years but only received loan options with partial forgiveness. The request said state funding is critical.\nSharp Road Park Expansion\nDenton is also requesting a bond for a playground at Sharp Road Park. According to the request, the \"total project costs are estimated at more than $1 million. While the town has secured some funding from the Department of Natural Resources and submitted additional applications, further support is needed.\"\nItems of Concern\nRestore full funding for the Rural Maryland Prosperity Investment Fund. The Mid-Shore Regional Council and the Rural Maryland Council are requesting the state restore full funding for the Rural Maryland Prosperity Investment Fund to its intended level of $9 million in fiscal year 2027. The fund aims to help raise the overall standard of living in rural areas to a level that meets or exceeds statewide benchmark averages by 2030.State highway request to build Gay Street/Shore Highway intersection with coordinated traffic light. Denton has supported the construction of Commerce Drive, a roadway connecting Gay Street to Legion Road at the Walmart intersection. The Maryland Department of Transportation previously approved a signalized intersection at Gay Street and Route 404. While private partnerships to build the road have stalled, the town remains committed to advancing the project and requests county support.Renewal of highway user revenue. Denton and the county request the restoring of the highway user revenue. The request states how important the highway user revenue is for residents of Caroline County. \"Without these funds, roadway conditions deteriorate, creating safety concerns and vehicle damage for residents and visitors. Restoring local Highway User Revenues would provide the Town with the resources necessary to address road maintenance needs in a timely and responsible manner,\" The county said in the request. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With shows at 6:30 p.m. each night and additional 9:30 p.m. performances on Thursday through Sunday, this locally written and directed show promises a macabre experience that blurs the lines between reality and delusion.The production is recommended for ages 16 and up; guests under 16 must be accompanied by a responsible guardian. Tickets are available through the Avalon Foundation website at avalonfoundation.org/event/stage-fright-curtain-call.\nSet in 1997, \"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" invites audiences into the dark, twisted world of Lou Baker, a 95-year-old former showman tormented by a violent past and spectral figures. Facing release from a psychiatric institution after over three decades, Lou's story unfolds through a captivating, immersive theater experience filled with unresolved mysteries, dark humor, and a chilling confrontation between past and present.\nInspired by real ghost stories, the experience features sound and lighting effects, unique smells, special themed drinks and specially crafted Lyon Rum cocktails, making it an evening attendees won't soon forget. Mature themes and extensive walking are part of this production.\n\"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" is the thrilling final act of a trilogy, with each installment having been set in a different era — 1927, 1964 and now, at the turn of the century in 1997. The production explores the final days of Lou Baker, who is \"95 and can barely get out of bed on his own.\" When presented with one last chance to release the spirit of Marguerite, his long, lost love and the ghost of the Avalon Theatre, he is met with a harrowing twist in his spiraling and tortured tale.\nAttendees are encouraged to dress up in their favorite '90s attire or Halloween costume. The play draws heavy inspiration from '90s MTV, and The Factory invites guests to arrive as their best Britney Spears, Madonna, Notorious B.I.G., Spice Girls, and other '90s celebrities.\nCecile Strom directs the production, with Talley Wilford as assistant director and Casey Rauch as writer and co-collaborator.\n\"A key element of The Factory's immersive productions is the integration of film,\" Director Cecile Storm said. \"It adds depth, context, and atmosphere to the live experience. This production takes this idea to new heights. I don't want to give too much away, but expect the boundary between stage and screen to blur in exciting and unexpected ways.\"\nKatie Cox stars in the leading role, supported by the Beauty Shop Quartet: Jennifer Madino as Marguerite Gardot, Grace Vorosmarti as Shirley Boudreaux, Maddie Megahan as Vivian Baker and Jeri Alexander as Minnie Valentine. Art and production are managed by Maggii Sarfaty, and Ray Nissen leads the music direction.\n\"The acting is captivating and intense. The music is well done and is such a nice touch to this already so creatively awesome haunted house-like experience,\" shared an audience member from a past production. Another remarked, \"It was great to see how the connection is made and everything is so eerily familiar, seeing as it's about the ghost that has haunted the Avalon for many years right here in Easton.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium — the prime ingredient in heroin and other opiates.\nThe Taliban seized $7 billion worth of U.S. weapons and military vehicles and systems after the American retreat. More than 2,400 American troops died during the war and occupation and there more than 221,000 deaths overall, according to Uppsala University in Sweden.\nA U.S. State Department inspector general's report last month said the U.S. may have mistakingly sent as much as $293 million in foreign aid to the Taliban after the 2021 withdrawal.\nSince regaining power, the Taliban have put in place restrictive Sharia Law based on Islamic rules aimed at women and girls, including requiring full coverings of women's faces and bodies.\n\"Taliban have issued more than eighty edicts targeting the twenty million women and girls who make up just short of 50 percent of Afghanistan's population. Women and girls face draconian restrictions in public life, namely, on education, employment, access to the justice system, and activities and travel outside the home. These include prohibitions on education beyond sixth grade, veiling and dress codes enforceable by the morality police, and bans on leaving the house without a mahram, a male relative chaperone,\" the Council on Foreign Relations in a summary of the regime's actions.\n\"Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have issued a ban on women's voices and bare faces in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.\"\nThe new bans on women's voices and bare faces in were handed down last month after they were approved by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban set up a ministry for the \"propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice\" after regaining power in 2021.\nThe U.S. State Department also criticized the Taliban's actions.\n\"The Taliban's relentless, discriminatory edicts and extreme policies are unparalleled and self-defeating. We have made clear to them in the last three years that they have a forked road ahead. If they respect the rights of the Afghan people and abide by Afghanistan's normative obligations, that is the road to reintegration into the international community. But the path the Taliban are pursuing is the same approach that made them a pariah in the 1990s. Their institutionalized campaign targeting women and girls constitutes gender persecution. The world is losing patience,\" said Rina Amiri, the U.S. Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"I would say critically important,\" James Young, the event's publicist, said said about Douglass. \"He's one of, if not the most respected and important figures in the history of the region. I think it's important for anybody to know more about his life and his work but especially for people who come from where he came from.\"\nFrederick Douglass Day kicked off with a parade led by Grand Marshal Childlene Brooks, former president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. The parade featured local groups including Building African American Minds, Easton High School NJROTC Color Guard, Polaris Village Academy, and the Easton and Oxford Fire Departments and many more.\nThis year, a big focus for the Frederick Douglass Honor Society was getting the younger generation involved in celebrating Douglass.\nGabriella Thompson, the mistress of ceremony, described as a \"ambitious 14-year-old entering her freshman year of high school,\" and Javion Jones, a 15-year-old minister at Union Baptist Church, were some of the youth featured throughout the day.\n\"I would say there has been some effort to get new people involved. As you know, a lot of people on the committee itself are getting up there,\" Young said. \"So it's a thing that we want to keep going for the foreseeable future, and so at some point you've got to bring in some some fresh blood.\"\nMultiple local leaders attended and participated in Frederick Douglass Day.\nJaelon Moaney, vice chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture, recited a famous speech by Douglass. The honor society believes having connections like Moaney are important for the success of the society and the annual event.\n\"Having that connection to African-American history more broadly, as well as current African-American issues, I think is very important,\" Young said. \"That's also something that we try to focus on with the keynote speaker that we bring every year. It's somebody who can bring a perspective of speaking on Douglas but also how he kind of fits into the history of African-American intellectual philosophy.\"\nIn an email following the event, Moaney emphasized his own Eastern Shore roots, similar to those of Douglass.\n\"I, too, am from and decidedly of Talbot,\" Moaney said. \"The Bailey and Moaney families remain connected today. Although two agitators separated by time, my chest began to swell with inexplicable energy while echoing the words delivered on November 25, 1878 from exactly where he stood nearly two centuries prior. As the country commemorates the semiquincentennial and Talbot reaches its 365th anniversary next year, I'm both troubled and moved by the parallels of reality that this experience has revealed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While hurricane season hasn't been a factor yet, it's also just starting to get into its prime, and that does remain a quiet wildcard for now.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The idea of having objects draw themselves on a plate without the aid of an artist's hand is a concept that is foreign now, but that's exactly how one of the early inventors, William Henry Fox Talbot, described his Calotype process.Baker will make his case on the subject at the meeting, which is free and open to the public. This talk will examine how the context in which a photograph is viewed can have an effect on how the image is interpreted.Baker's photographs are in the permanent collections of more than forty museums, including The Smithsonian, The George Eastman Museum, The American Museum of Natural History, The Nelson-Atkins Museum and The Science Museum in London.He has published 9 books and numerous scientific articles and book chapters.His current traveling exhibition \"Hidden Beauty: Exploring The Aesthetics of Medical Science\" shows the beauty of medicine and the human body and will be going on a museum tour in 2014-2023. His latest book \"Perambulations\" was published in 2022 by Man & Lion Press. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Two plays later, Junior Council ripped off a 25-yard run to set the Eagles up with a first-and-goal. Xavier Granado then took it in from four yards out to give the Eagles their first lead of the game with 7:12 remaining.Granado credited his offensive line for helping him find the holes necessary to get the go-ahead score.\"I love my line,\" Granado said. \"They got me anywhere I needed to go and that's all you can hope for in a playoff game.\" After another defensive stop on the ensuing Colonel Richardson possession, Bohemia Manor found its in familiar territory as its offense had the ball in the final minutes with a chance to seal the victory.The Eagles did just that as a key 18-yard run by Granado, followed by Chris Harris' quarterback keeper on a third-and-3 resulted in a first down. Harris' rushing touchdown in the second quarter put the Eagles within a point at the half.\"I just let my running back and my o-line do the work,\" Harris said. \"Let them get the yards, burn the clock, get the first downs and seal the win.\" Colonel Richardson head coach James Jackson thought his team made too many self-inflicted mistakes down the stretch that cost them in a close game.Colonel Richardson led for the majority of the game after taking an early 7-0 lead in the first quarter on quarterback Tarron Hammond's 5-yard touchdown run.\"We were our own 12th man,\" Jackson said. \"We had some bad snaps and got behind in the distance on drives and it hurt us. It's been like that for us all year but in a playoff game you can't have that.\" Bo Manor head coach Vince Ricci praised his team for its gritty performance and not letting the results from the previous two weeks carry into the playoff openere. The Eagles entered Friday's contest coming off back-to-back losses against Perryville and Fallston.Bohemia Manor scored a combined two points in the pair of losses.Perryville defeated Bohemia Manor 42-2 in the regular season three weeks ago.\"We knew coming in that we needed to get back to being gritty and playing Bo Manor football,\" Ricci said.\"It takes us back to those first couple weeks when we were winning by grinding out the end of game situations.\" \n \n Caption: KYLE INGERSON/CECIL WHIG\n \nBohemia Manor's Drew Lenz (4) is wrapped up by a trio of Colonel Richardson players during Friday night's Class 1A East Regional playoff. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Haunts throughout the country attract large crowds year-round, especially around Halloween.\nIn its 2023 Haunt Industry Report, HauntPay, a haunted attraction ticketing platform, reports 33% of haunts were expecting to receive upwards of 10,000 visitors, a notable increase from 2022. That year, 42% of haunted attractions saw visitor numbers between 1,000 and 5,000.\nVenture beyond the grave and visit some of America's scariest real-life haunts to celebrate the season.\n12 Terrifying Places in America to Embrace Your Spooky SideFrom abandoned prisons to historic homes and even a zoo, these are 12 of the scariest haunted locations in America worth visiting this month.\nEastern State Penitentiary, PennsylvaniaExplore the supposedly haunted grounds of Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary — if you dare. This abandoned prison once held famous criminals like Al Capone and Willie Sutton before closing in 1971 and falling into disrepair.\n\"Visiting Eastern State Penitentiary is like stepping into a real-life horror movie,\" says Partners in Fire owner Melanie Allen. \"The desolate, crumbling halls and long-abandoned rooms hold an unyielding tension.\"\nVisitors can tour the prison year-round. The facility also hosts seasonal Halloween Nights, which feature haunted houses, spine-tingling tours, themed bars, and live entertainment.\nThe House of the Seven Gables, MassachusettsThe House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668, is among Salem's eeriest attractions. Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel of the same name mainstreamed the property.\nThe home is a must-visit for those interested in colonial architecture and Salem lore. Every October, tourists can enjoy autumnal storytelling performances that heighten the unsettling atmosphere ahead of Halloween.\nWaverly Hills Sanatorium, KentuckyGhost-hunting enthusiasts flock to Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a former tuberculosis treatment center operational from 1910 to 1961.\nMany visitors report supernatural encounters, from doors slamming on their own to sightings of a young ghost boy. Delve into the property's dark past on a guided tour, or pack a tote with essentials for a private overnight investigation.\nWaverly Hills Sanatorium also hosts a terrifying haunted house during the fall, made scarier by the sanatorium's paranormal reputation.\nStanley Hotel, ColoradoThe Stanley Hotel opened in 1909 as a getaway for guests seeking upscale accommodations in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Its reputation faltered in the 1970s, but one visit from author Stephen King changed everything. King later wrote his horror classic The Shining, drawing inspiration from Stanley Hotel.\nGuests often claim to hear disembodied laughter, feel phantom touches, and sense ghostly presences. Amp up the scares during your overnight stay with a theatrical séance or nighttime tour.\nLincoln Park Zoo, IllinoisIn addition to the zoo animals you'd expect to see, Lincoln Park Zoo is reportedly home to several spirits. Lincoln Park was once the site of Chicago's official city cemetery, and some say thousands of bodies remain buried there today.\nThe zoo hosted its first official paranormal investigation in 2013 after reports of apparitions and disembodied voices in the Lion and Primate Houses.\nOctober visitors can join an evening Haunted History Tour to learn more about the zoo's hauntings. Wear comfortable shoes like boots to enjoy the eerie surroundings while exploring the zoo after dark.\nOhio State Reformatory, OhioThe historic Ohio State Reformatory operated from 1896 to 1990 and is the ideal destination for supernatural lovers. Visitors may recognize it from The Shawshank Redemption, filmed there in 1993.\nThere have been many documented instances of dark figures and incorporeal voices at the Ohio State Reformatory, even among inmates before its closure.\nThe reformatory boasts an impressive program for those seeking a supernatural encounter, including group ghost tours and private, hours-long investigations.\nThe Mark Twain House, Connecticut\nStep back in time at the Mark Twain House in Connecticut, where the famous writer and his family lived in the late 1800s.\nThis Victorian home is a hotspot for unexplained phenomena, including sightings of a ghostly woman in white — possibly the spirit of one of Twain's daughters who died there.\nGuests eager to explore this haunt can embark on a Graveyard Shift Ghost Tour to learn the home's most fascinating tales from beyond the grave.\nSt. Augustine Lighthouse, Florida\nThe spirits of several young children who died there in 1873 supposedly haunt Florida's St. Augustine Lighthouse.\nSome lighthouse employees and visitors claim to hear giggling and see ghostly apparitions, while others feel an otherworldly presence throughout the site.\nHear spine-chilling stories of the lighthouse's hauntings on a group tour, or bring ghost-hunting equipment to conduct a private nighttime investigation.\nWinchester Mystery House, CaliforniaThe Winchester Mystery House is among San Jose's strangest attractions. The owner, arms company heiress Sarah Winchester, began the bizarre multi-decade renovation following her family's death. She expanded the home to 24,000 square feet, installing 160 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, and six kitchens.\n\"Doors open to nothing, stairs lead to solid walls, and there seems to be an overall feeling of chaos and unsettling vibes that bothered me when visiting,\" explains Chantelle Kincy of Flannels or Flipflops.\nOver the years, many guests have claimed to see specters and hear footsteps in the Winchester Mystery House. Visitors can see areas of the home on year-round guided tours or embark on a seasonal haunted maze through four of the mansion's floors.\nBonaventure Cemetery, GeorgiaWhile southern Georgia's Bonaventure Cemetery is among the world's most beautiful cemeteries, it's also incredibly unsettling.\n\"It was extremely quiet, and there was an overwhelming feeling of sadness as we walked around,\" Jessy Hamel of Brighter Things shares about her visit.\nVarious local legends surround the cemetery, including voodoo rituals and a child spirit that roams the grounds. In October, the cemetery allows guests to embark on a full moon tour, enhancing the creepy atmosphere.\nThe Conjuring House, Rhode IslandSee the terrifying real-life home that inspired The Conjuring movie universe. The house's haunted history stretches back centuries since its construction in the 1730s.\nIn the 1970s, the Perron family bought the home and immediately started having ghostly run-ins. At one point, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren took an interest in the house.\nAccording to the Perron family, at least two spirits — a married couple who passed away in the 1800s — haunt the house. Interest in the property spiked following the 2013 release of The Conjuring, a hit horror movie that spawned an entire franchise.\nThe current homeowner offers a variety of spooky experiences, from guided daytime tours to overnight investigations where you can bring a blanket and settle in for a night of ghost-hunting.\nSan Fernando Cathedral, TexasSan Fernando Cathedral, established in 1731, is a beautifully haunting church. It's the oldest of its kind in Texas and is said to be among San Antonio's most haunted locations.\nNumerous bodies lie within the cathedral walls, and visitors have reported spectral sightings of dark silhouettes and mysterious orbs. Many San Antonio ghost tours visit the historic cathedral to highlight its storied past.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But I like our chances.\"\nA chance created Tuesday night, when Thomas Wilson Jr. banked home an off-balance fadeway jumper with 7.3 seconds left to boost the Vikings to a 65-63 victory over Liberty in the semifinals. A chance that was created on the SEED side of the ledger about two hours later, when Khaled Al-Matten Evans banked in a winner with 8 seconds remaining to help the Sabers complete a 60-59 come-from-behind victory over defending state champion Edmondson-Westside.\n\"I saw them play Edmondson last year,\" SEED head coach Edward Green Jr. said of Cambridge-SD Thursday during a phone interview. \"I've been keeping up on them all year. So of course, very good team. Back in the title game, so that says a lot about their program. So that loss last year in the final, and to be able to come right back and reach the final again, I have a lot of respect for them doing that. I think they have overall good team size, and they're very talented.\"\nA talented team that will bid for the school's first state title since 1996, and can have a different scoring leader any game.\nA senior, the 6-5 Ennals has averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds an outing this season, while 6-4 junior Semaj Pinder comes in averaging 19 points a game. Junior guard Sterling Perkins Jr. has scored 15 a game, and Wilson, who has emerged down the stretch, had averaged 10 per contest. The Vikings have also gotten big contributions from seniors Anthony Hughes and Jaden Harris, and sophomore K'Marion Hall.\n\"We're a year older,\" said Tucker, who noted his team leaned heavily on graduated guard LaShaun Moody last season. \"Our juniors were sophomores last year and they were out there just playing. Now, they're out there understanding our goal.\n\"And we're better this year because we had a guy like Thomas Wilson on our roster, and nobody knows about him,\" Tucker continued. \"The kid can shoot the cover off the basketball. And he's getting opportunities. Now, he's been in the starting lineup and nobody really talks about him.\"\nGreen may have wondered if anybody was going to talk about his team after the Sabers suffered a 59-43 loss to St. Vincent Pallotti on Jan. 28. But SEED hasn't lost since and arrives to its first state final in program history riding a 10-game win streak.\n\"In our last loss to St. Vincent Pallotti, we didn't really step up and show our best selves,\" Green said. \"So it was as matter of us not taking advantage of opportunity in the big games. As a small school, we're trying to make a name for ourself. But every opportunity we got against like an A Conference school, or we'd play Philly teams and teams in Virginia, and we didn't play our best basketball.\"\nThe Sabers played some of their best ball Tuesday against No. 2 seed Edmondson-Westside, erasing a seven-point, third quarter deficit en route to upsetting the defending champs.\n\"It's about understanding our identity,\" Green said. \"And we have a defensive identity.\"\nSEED has also established a winning identity since February. In addition to junior shooting guard, Al-Matten Evans, the backcourt features sophomore point guard Chase Pralieau and junior Tyler Dubose. Senior Ahmad Evans, a 6-8 center, 6-8 junior forward Merdi Tshiabide and 6-5 junior sixth man Omar Williams will look to make impacts inside and on the boards today.\n\"We just have to be true to ourselves,\" Green said. \"I think defense travels. If we can limit some of the things they like to do, maybe take one thing away from them, I think it will give us a chance. But they have a lot of guys who can contribute. So we can't really focus as much on what they're going to do as much as what we have control over.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobson.\nThe A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus, located on Mistletoe Drive, will be 7,200 square feet and provide state-of-the-art training opportunities for all first responders.\nAs the rendering showed, a building on the training campus will be named after Paul Prager and his wife, Joanne. The Pragers donated $500,000 to the project.\nForte said Thursday that $4.5 million has been raised in the last two-and-a-half years, nearly all of the project's $5 million goal. Project leaders hope for the campus to open by the end of this year.\n\"(It's) taken many, many years; many, many people; many hours; many ideas,\" Forte said. \" … Raising the money was the hardest thing.\"\nAfter the event, Brown said in an interview he's impressed with the coordination between the different first responder agencies in Talbot County.\n\"Often people think small, rural community on the Eastern Shore, 'how busy does it get?'\" Brown said. \"But clearly the numbers show that they're busy. It's important to stand ready. The facility that is going to be built is going to help them do that.\"\nWhen asked afterward if the First Responders Celebration is becoming a tradition, Prager had no hesitation.\n\"It's gotta be, absolutely,\" Prager said. \"These people do thankless jobs. And there's not a whole lot you can do to enable them to make their lives better. So I think if you at least just say thank you, that goes a long way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Family fights Dunkirk cemetery's plan to move plot\n\n December 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 508\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to her daughter, it was in 1989 that Gloria Moseley purchased two plots at Dunkirk's Southern Memorial Gardens. It was supposed to be a modest resting place in a quiet rural setting.Laura Dodgson, Moseley's daughter who now lives in North Carolina, said her sister died in 1994 and her brother died four years later. Urns containing their ashes were buried side-by-side on the site.\nGloria Moseley died in 2002 and eight years later her husband, Robert, passed. Both were laid to rest at the family gravesite.\nSouthern Memorial Gardens has had different owners since 1989, when the Moseleys purchased the plots.\nNow the cemetery owners say mistakes have been made. Their solution has brought distress to the family.\nIn a letter to Southern Maryland News, Dodgson said she received a phone call from cemetery officials back in September.\n\"They stated that my family had been buried in the wrong plot and that they would have to be dug up and moved,\" Dodgson wrote.\nDuring a phone conversation with Dodgson after the letter was received, Southern Maryland News learned cemetery officials, via mail, told her to sign papers for moving the family members to another location.\n\"I don't want them moved,\" Dodgson said.\nWhen Southern Maryland News contacted the cemetery about the situation, the employee answering the phone provided contact information for the business's attorney, Kevin Vitelli.\n\"It happens at every cemetery,\" Vitelli said of the Moseley family's situation. \"Mistakes were made in 1989. We're just trying to make it right.\"\nVitelli, whose law practice is based in Pennsylvania, said the relocation of the family's plot would be done at no additional cost.\nThe local cemetery has a well-documented history of problems.\nNearly 20 years ago, fraudulent activity on the part of former owner, Larry Deffenbaugh, came to light after a Maryland State Police investigation. Deffenbaugh was later convicted of defrauding over 500 people out of funeral and memorial items.\nHe had entered an Alford plea, which is not an admission of guilt, but an acknowledgment that prosecutors have evidence to support a charge, received a 15-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay restitution to the victims.\nDeffenbaugh's story then gets more convoluted, as he was summoned back to court for a violation of probation hearing but failed to appear. Apparently not wishing to go to prison, Deffenbaugh reportedly fell off a fishing boat. He was, however, recaptured in 2010 and sent to prison.\nDodgson said her late sister's daughter, Pam, filed court papers to have her mother's urn removed from the cemetery and given over to her. Dodgson and another family member confirmed that the urn was flooded with water.\nDodgson said she fears the disturbance of the plot could result in the collapse of the vaults where her parents' coffins are laid.\nThe family has been in contact with attorneys for a possible breech of contract and gross negligence lawsuit.\n\"There were some mistakes made by prior owners,\" Vitelli said of the Southern Memorial Gardens situation. \"We have to correct those mistakes.\"\nThe attorney added that while aggrieved plot owners have been urged to file suit, \"nobody has filed any action against the cemetery.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Don't let challenges overcome your Christmas season\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Christmas is a joyful season but always has some challenges.The place of Christmas is often a question. Mary and Joseph ended up in Bethlehem when Jesus was born. They had gone there to pay taxes. Paying taxes is never fun but something we have to do. The place they ended up when Jesus was born was probably not their desired location to bear their first child, but they made the most of the location.\nLocation trips a lot of people up on Christmas. Many have no choice. They will spend Christmas in the nursing home or jail. Many have no options. They may be too elderly or sick to travel. They may not have any place to go. If you have options then be thankful. If you have a place to spend Christmas then this is one of your best gifts of all. Don't fight about the place where you will spend Christmas. Make the best of wherever you end up and celebrate with whoever is around.\nThe presents of Christmas are often stressful. Presents are expensive and often we don't know what to buy and how much to spend. You may have a lot of gifts to buy or maybe you don't have a single person for whom you will buy a gift. If you can afford to buy gifts and want to then enjoy the opportunity. If finances are meager this year, then be honest with yourself and others and say our list and budget is very limited this year. Don't put yourself in financial jeopardy by spending money you don't have. The greatest gift is the baby Jesus. Focusing on Him will bring more peace than a house filled with gifts.\nThe pageantry of Christmas often becomes work. How many lights can you string on your roof or around your shrubbery? I enjoy putting up lights on a warm day but despise taking them down in January. Just remember what goes up must come down, eventually. Try to find a mild weather day, and you won't feel like the grinch.\nThe pressure of Christmas gets to a lot of people. People die in December. Loneliness takes over. Stress becomes paramount. People get depressed. Christmas should never be a time of loneliness, stress or pressure, but it was a difficult time for Mary and Joseph. They were poor people. Bringing a child into the world in a stable would not be considered an option for most of us. Traveling was a hassle and very difficult back then. While they were overjoyed with the baby Jesus, life's circumstances were not easy. Later, they would flee to Egypt for the safety of their family which had to add to their pressure.\nThe person of Christmas must be our focus in order to truly celebrate this season. Let's not lose sight of the main character in the Christmas story. If we do, then we will focus on the place, presents, pageantry and pressures of Christmas. Thus, we will miss out on the real joy that the heavenly host proclaimed to those shepherds watching their sheep.\n\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" (Luke 2:14). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Brewster's books honor first responders\n\n June 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1168\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Writers' Association created the Writers' Round Table Program to encourage writers, poets, playwrights and authors through monthly articles and activities.The Notable Maryland Author articles and associated Fun With Words writers' prompts are the centerpiece of the program. Each month, Southern Maryland Newspapers will feature a Maryland Writer's Association article about an author. Marylanders are encouraged to read the articles and try their hand at the writing prompts each month.\nAuthor: James Burd Brewster\nGenre: Children's picture books. Books contain pictures or illustrations that complement the story, often mirroring the plot. Both the text and the illustrations are important to the story. The pictures get the reader's attention and the text tells the complete story.\nSample reading list: \"Uncle Rocky — Fireman: Fire!\" \"Sparky Protects, Ice Rescue,\" \"Officer Jack: Underwater, Baby's Breath, Tourniquets for Heroes, La Plata Maryland — Team Effort; EMT Morales: Clamshell Stretcher, Deep Snow.\n\"Glad to do it!\" — James Burd Brewster\nBrewster was born a twin in Rochester, N.Y., on Dec, 8, 1954. Raised in Albany, he attended the United States Coast Guard Academy. Assigned to Wilmington, N.C. after graduation, he met and married Katie Spivey and careers later led them to Baltimore in 1987.\nHoping to give his sons a desire to help others, he began telling \"Uncle Rocky — Fireman\" stories.\nTwenty-two years later, the family moved to Pomfret and after their youngest son Sam Sam left for college, they took a Wayne Karlan creative writing course at the College of Southern Maryland where the idea of turning the Uncle Rocky stories into books bubbled to the surface. With St. Mary's County illustrator Christina Allen and the support of Yvonne Medley's Life Journey's Writer's Guild, the couple started a publishing company and published their first book, \"Uncle Rocky — Fireman\" in 2013.\nInitially, Brewster made up the stories and only had firemen books but at their first book show, a woman told him about a fire rescue her father had performed in New York City and Brewster realized he should base his future stories on real rescues. Her story evolved into \"Face Mask\" in the \"Uncle Rocky — Fireman series.\"\nOther first responders later asked Brewser to write about them and to date, the \"Glad to do it!\" series consists of 21 books, 10 about firemen, eight about police, and three about EMT.\nThrough a grant provided by the Maryland State Arts Council, Brewster customized a \"Glad to do it!\" book specifically for the La Plata police department, titled \"La Plata, Maryland — Team Effort.\"\nBrewster joined the MWA in 2017 and a year later initiated the Notable Maryland Author series as part of its 30th anniversary.\nNext month's Notable Maryland Author article, the 77th in the series, will be the last as Brewster and his wife are moving to be closer with their grandchildren.\nFor more information on the \"Glad to do it!\" books, go to www.GladToDoIt.net.\nFun With Words\nThe MWA invites writers to have fun writing children's books about first responders like Jim Brewster. Using up to 100 words, pick a first responder service and write dialogue between first responders before, during, and after the dispatcher calls them.\nTitle your work and send to https://marylandwriters.org/Notable_Maryland_Authors by June 30th to receive an MWA Fun With Words submission certificate.\nLast month, readers were asked writers to write metafiction like John Barth and in 100 words pick a literary convention and parody it or explore a relationship between literature and reality, life, and art.\nHere are some regional selections:\nAnything Goes in our Town\nThis fairy tale it may sound 'Grimm', but The Princess Bride has heard/\nThat Don Quixote he has said \"I Want to Kill a Mockingbird.\"/\nAnd Uncle Remus has just crossed, The Bridge Over The River Kwai/\nHe's on The Hunt for Red October, with The Catcher in the Rye/\nAll their noise stirred Rip Van Winkle, who is no longer fast asleep/\nFrom Wuthering Heights he asks us now, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?/\nThen The Maltese Falcon shared, a lesson from The Mouse That Roared/\nThe author's pen it really is, much more mighty than the sword. /\nSteve Baker, Waldorf\nFolly's Wisdom\nIn ancient Baghdad there lived a scribe named Abeez. Every day he scratched down with a distracted qalam on papyrus grain counts half-heard. Truly, he wished to write stories but lacked plots.\nOne day he learned in the Storytellers' Precinct of the Plot Djinn. This magical being knew tales yet told. From that time on, Abeez searched for the storied spirit.\nTen years later, he found the djinn haunting ruined Antara.\nAbeez said, \"I desire original plots.\"\n\"Turn around,\" the djinn said. \"What do you see?\"\n\"My footprints shadowing dunes.\"\nThe djinn smiled. \"In them find the stories you seek.\"\nLawrence McGuire, Waldorf\nChatter Boxing\nYou hear continuous chattering through walls pretty thin. What you hear is from two male dwellers, Bosco and Letague. Between the chatter you hear music playing, tenors singing opera or show tunes. The music prompts more activity like furniture moving, clatter of dishes.\nI recognize Bosco plainly. He sounds louder and even caustic. Letague, a more gentle soul, is meek in manor and does not retort.\nSounds are shadows not permitting a full picture. Bells tinkle, doors close, and at middle age they rarely leave home. They are occupied by daily events between sunrise and sunset.\nHow I came to adopt these two parakeets is another story.\nChristine Hickey, Deale\nHappy Endings\nWithin the zeitgeist of modern culture, three forms of \"happy endings\" abide: The satisfying organic resolution to a real or fictional narrative that begins fraught and concludes well; the overwrought and over-written Hallmark Network tear-jerking formulaic caca-show that requires a complete suspension of belief and rationality; and the mirthless carnal conclusion to an unlicensed and medically useless non-therapeutic massage by a bored and contemptuous \"masseuse.\"\nI remain a fan of two out of three of those. It's silly, I know. Cannot help it. I bubble up, start quivering and soon need a Kleenex. If that's a crime, arrest me.\nJon Ketzner, Cumberland\nScenes from (Not Quite) True TV Detective\nThe night was dark, no stars, no moon. The building stood before them, a hulking half-acre maze of pitch-black rooms and hallways. The perps were in there, somewhere. Ignoring the obvious need for support, the detectives entered, the beams from their tiny flashlights dancing off the walls and corners.\nI want to scream, \"No, you idiots! Wait for backup! Or at least turn on a freakin' light!\"\nWho writes this stuff?\nThen…\"Clear!\"\nWait, what's clear, that room you scanned for two seconds without looking in any closets or other obvious hiding places? That's clear?! Who writes this stuff?!\nJim Coleman, Ridgely\nTrain Encounter\nAs Maggie sat down, the woman next to her whispered. \"Hello, Maggie.\"\nMaggie turned. The woman looked familiar. \"Do I know you?\" she replied.\n\"I am Lilly, the mousey woman from Strangers on the Beach. I just loved being in your novel. It was a best seller, but basically a beach read, don't you think? Not up for a Pulitzer,\" the woman replied.\nMaggie stared at her.\n\"Another thing, if you put me in a novel again, could I have big boobs and ooze with sex appeal?\" The train bumped.\n\"Gotta go,\" she said exiting her seat. Maggie sat stunned.\nBeth Smith, Cockeysville \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "USDA awards MARBIDCO funding to assist with expansion of livestock processing\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 545\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - The United States Department of Agriculture recently announced it is awarding $3.8 million from its Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program to the Maryland Agricultural Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation to finance the start-up and expansion of independent meat and poultry processing facilities in Maryland.MARBIDCO is a quasi-governmental economic development and financial intermediary organization with a mission to serve the commercial farming, forestry and seafood industries of Maryland.The USDA Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program awards funds to financial intermediaries, like MARBIDCO, in the form of a grant to allow them to establish specialized revolving loan programs. The objective of the MPILP is to strengthen the financing capacity for small-and midsized independent meat processors, and to create a more resilient, diverse, and secure U.S. food supply chain.MARBIDCO is supplementing the USDA grant with another $1.3 million of its own funds to establish a special pool of lending capital of approximately $5 million.The Maryland Livestock Processing Loan Fund is designed to assist with the expansion of livestock and blue catfish processing capacity in Maryland. Farmers raising cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs still are facing very long lead times to get their animals processed, while blue catfish is an invasive fish species in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries that is having a very detrimental impact on other species of fish and shellfish. Increasing commercial harvest and consumption of these catfish is one way to significantly reduce their numbers.Businesses engaged in the processing of livestock, or the invasive blue catfish can apply for a Maryland Livestock Processing Loan, which may also include an equity incentive grant of up to 10% of the project cost. Loan and grant proceeds can be used to purchase livestock processing and cold storage equipment, build or upgrade meat processing facilities, as well as purchase real estate on which the livestock processing activity will occur.MARBIDCO's Livestock Processing Loan Fund can offer standalone financing or work in conjunction with other financing provided by commercial lenders.\"This should be an incredible win for Maryland. The addition of new or significantly expanded meat processing facilities will positively impact many people within the food supply chain, from farmers and commercial fisherman to consumer's tables with these locally produced protein products,\" said MARBIDCO Executive Director Steve McHenry. \"We are delighted to be a USDA grant recipient, and we want to thank the Maryland Department of Agriculture and our State's entire Congressional Delegation for their support of our application in what was a very competitive nationwide process.\" Loan amounts can range from a minimum of $250,000 up to a maximum of $2,500,000. MARBIDCO will charge a below-market fixed interest rate of 4% and will work cooperatively with borrowers on establishing other appropriate loan terms and conditions.An equity contribution of at least 7.5% of a project's total cost is required by the borrower (which can be matched dollar-for-dollar with a grant, not to exceed 10% of the project's total cost). The available equity grant match is coming from special funds appropriated to MARBIDCO by the State of Maryland to help enhance livestock processing capacity and cut down on long wait times.Further information and the program application form is available on MARBIDCO's website: www. marbidco.org. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CONNIE CONNOLLY\n \nBlue catfish fillets await skinning at the only USDA processing facility on the Eastern Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Grant was named General of the Army of the United States, the first officer to hold the rank.\nIn 1943, Benito Mussolini was dismissed as premier of Italy by King Victor Emmanuel III, and placed under arrest. (He was later rescued by the Nazis and re-asserted his authority.)\nIn 1946, the United States detonated an atomic bomb near Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in the first underwater test of the device.\nIn 1956, the Italian liner SS Andrea Doria collided with the Swedish passenger ship Stockholm off the New England coast late at night and began sinking; 51 people — 46 from the Andrea Doria, five from the Stockholm — were killed. (The Andrea Doria capsized and sank the following morning.)\nIn 1960, a Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina, that had been the scene of nearly six months of sit-in protests against its whites-only lunch counter dropped its segregation policy.\nIn 1978, Louise Joy Brown, the first \"test tube baby,\" was born in Oldham, England; she'd been conceived through the technique of in vitro fertilization.\nIn 1994, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein signed a declaration at the White House ending their countries' 46-year-old formal state of war.\nIn 2000, a New York-bound Air France Concorde crashed outside Paris shortly after takeoff, killing all 109 people on board and four people on the ground; it was the first-ever crash of the supersonic jet.\nIn 2010, the online whistleblower Wikileaks posted some 90,000 leaked U.S. military records that amounted to a blow-by-blow account of the Afghanistan war, including unreported incidents of Afghan civilian killings as well as covert operations against Taliban figures.\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump had a second phone call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which he solicited Zelenskyy's help in gathering potentially damaging information about former Vice President Joe Biden; that night, a staff member at the White House Office of Management and Budget signed a document that officially put military aid for Ukraine on hold.\nIn 2022, on a visit to Canada, Pope Francis issued a historic apology for the Catholic Church's cooperation with the country's \"catastrophic\" policy of Indigenous residential schools, saying the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\nToday's Birthdays: Folk-pop singer-musician Bruce Woodley (The Seekers) is 83. Rock musician Jim McCarty (The Yardbirds) is 82. Reggae singer Rita Marley is 79. Musician Verdine White (Earth, Wind & Fire) is 74. Model-actor Iman is 70.

    "content": "Listen to the rhythm at the Chestertown Farmers Market\n\n July 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTEROWN — Each Saturday morning at the Chestertown Farmers Market on High Street, customers can find a refreshing variety of items from produce to baked goodies and handwoven crafts.Last weekend, among quilters, painters and wood carvers, author Marianne Laino Sade was selling her children's books, \"TAPUM\" and her latest \"TA DA\".\n\"TA DA\" is especially welcome as baby's first book, recommended for ages 0-4 and their caregivers. \"Children need their parents, grandparents, caregivers and guardians to read to them. It is so important for fundamental growth,\" Sade said.\nSo the books need to be interesting to the babies and those reading to them. And they certainly are.\nSade's offerings Saturday were each signed by the author. The artwork in her book is created in a collage style, using cut outs and concepts gleaned from her experiences as an English major and librarian across Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania.\nHer first book published in 2022, \"TAPUM\" features a colorful drum on the cover and each element within the drum: the sun, the sea, a lion, are all pages in the book.\nDone in that unique collage style, using patterns and dark and light contrasts, there is great attention to detail on each page.\nYou can hear the song playing along as you read.\n\"TAPUM!\" is the sound of the drum in the world all around. Can you hear its rhythm? \"TaPUM, Tapum, TaPUM!\",\" the back panel reads.\nSade said \"TAPUM\" came to her while awaiting a bus in New York in the 80's and just hearing that sound repeated. She was again inspired from attending a drum event featuring many world drummers including Babatunde Olatunji, hailed as the father of African drumming in the United States.\n\"TA DA\" came about a little differently. Sade combined animals and music, visualizing frogs, dogs, birds and other colorful critters wanting to be a music band. With a nod to the Chester River Packet, the animal band perform at the end of High Street by the water.\nThe book talks about the universal appeal of music: \"TA DA\" celebrates the joy of making music together\" and is a companion book to \"TAPUM\" following a musical theme.\nBoth books have thick, durable board pages and were appealing to families passing through the market such as Joseph and Amanda Carchi and their baby daughter Marie and son Owen. Little Marie smiled widely pointing at the pictures while Joseph read to her.\n\"These are very cool,\" Amanda noted.\nSo far, \"TA DA\" is doing well in sales too, selling at least 100 out of the 500 they ordered, Sade's husband Chris pointed out.\nAnd perhaps as many authors tend to do, she is toying with a trilogy.\nSade said she has been reflecting about her childhood but would say nothing further, not wanting to spoil the big surprise.\nCheck out her books at msadeart.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Save a blue crab, eat a blue catfish\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The blue crab population has been struggling. For the last four years, experts say, it has experienced significant declines, negatively affecting the economy and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay.Yet, for some studying blue crab populations, the answer to preserving the species is simple.\nAllison Colden, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland, said one of the best ways to help preserve and uplift the rise of blue crabs in the Chesapeake Bay is by eating more blue catfish.\nColden explained that blue catfish are an invasive species that has been a primarily threat to the blue crab population on the Eastern Shore.\nHarvesting and eating more blue catfish can help reduce their numbers and alleviate some of the predation pressure blue catfish are placing on important species like blue crabs, allowing blue crabs and other native species a better chance at survival and growing their low population numbers, she said.\nThere is agreement among environmental organizations, political leaders and watermen that creating a more streamlined path from harvesting blue catfish to getting them to market and table is key to getting control of their numbers.\nMany watermen suggest establishing a whole new fishery of blue catfish alongside striped bass, blue crabs, oysters and other Bay produce. But for commercial fishermen, who have the capacity to harvest thousands of pounds of blue catfish, jumping through the regulatory hoops currently in place can be daunting and discouraging.\nTilghman Island Seafood in Talbot County is the only USDA-certified blue catfish processor on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nAccording to the state's website, Maryland is a prominent producer and processor of seafood and is the national leader in supplying blue crabs. The Chesapeake Bay provides about 50% of the total blue crab harvest in the United States, and each year, the Maryland seafood industry contributes nearly $600 million to the state's economy.\nColden said that 2022 had the lowest number of crabs on record according to a dredge survey by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and Maryland Department of Natural Resources documenting population growth from 1990 to the present. These numbers have left experts concerned about the species.\n\"What has been concerning over the past couple of years is that we're seeing lower numbers of crabs that are staying low,\" Colden said. \"In particular, the number of juvenile crabs is now at four years in a row below that long-term average, which is a concern because those juvenile crabs, which are sampled in the wintertime, are the ones that grow up to support the blue crab fishery in the fall.\"\nColden said this would mainly affect people who are fishing for crabs. Low numbers would impact the fishery and impact profits.\nAccording to the 2024 dredge, there was a total crab abundance of 317 million blue crabs, a slight decrease from last year's estimated population of 323 million. However, it is still above the 2022 record low of 227 million crabs.\nIn 2024, the adult female crab population decreased to 133 million compared with 152 million last year. According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this number falls far below the target of 215 million adult female crabs needed for a healthy population and sustainable harvest in the Chesapeake Bay.\nJuvenile crab numbers improved slightly compared to 2022 numbers, but the juvenile population remained below average for the fourth year. Male crab numbers decreased from 55 million in 2023 to 46 million in 2024 despite male harvest limits instituted last year.\nChris Moore, executive director of Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in a statement, \"While juvenile population estimates can vary greatly from year to year, it is encouraging to see a slight increase in this segment of the population. However, given the population estimates from this year's survey, there remains a significant need to continue to protect adult females and critical nursery habitats, like underwater grasses, in order to help ensure better numbers in the future. \"\nColden said she understands that they will not be able to eradicate blue catfish, but eating more of this invasive species would help alleviate factors that are negatively impacting blue crabs, which would give the blue crabs the best chance to bounce back from these low numbers.\n\"The Department of Natural Resources in Maryland is encouraging people to get out and eat catfish; they're delicious to eat, they're fun to fight if you're a recreational or commercial angler, and it will help reduce the impact that they're having on our native species — blue crabs,\" Colden said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His charges stem from a fire he started at his home in November 2022.At a sentencing hearing Friday, Judge Thomas G. Ross also handed Rider a 20-year sentence for first-degree arson with all but the time he's already served suspended. Rider was given five years of probation with conditions that include attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and completing an abuser intervention program.\nIn August, Rider pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment for a fire started at his home in Easton on Nov. 24, 2022. He faced up to 30 years in prison and $50,000 in fines for first-degree arson and up to 25 years in prison and $25,000 in fines for the five counts of reckless endangerment.\nRider had also been charged with second-degree arson, first-degree malicious burning, two counts of arson threat, two counts of malicious destruction of property, obstruction of emergency assistance and two additional counts of reckless endangerment. As part of a plea deal, the state did not prosecute Rider for those nine additional charges.\nForty-five firefighters responded to the fire in Rider's two-story, single-family home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton. Through investigation, officials classified the fire as incendiary.\nAccording to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put the firefighters who responded in danger.\nAt Rider's plea hearing, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Joyce Jones said Rider blocked his two driveways with vehicles before setting fire to the house.\nThat night, Rider was located a short distance from his home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care. Rider's attorney Christine DuFour said at the plea hearing that Rider was under the influence of alcohol during the incident and had slit his wrists.\nAt the sentencing hearing Friday, Jones asked that Rider's sentencing include incarceration. She said the fire was a planned event, citing threatening texts he sent his wife, Kari Rider, who is currently in the midst of a divorce from Trey Rider.\nAt the sentencing, Kari Rider said the night of the fire has caused her and their two sons lasting emotional and psychological effects. She said she and Trey Rider had been in a \"horribly abusive relationship\" and he had been destroying her things for years.\nA restitution hearing, which Kari Rider asked for Friday, is set to be scheduled after the divorce proceedings.\nDuFour, Trey Rider's attorney, said that over the past seven months, Trey Rider has put in hard work at a recovery center and a sober living home. She said that while he has a ways to go, Rider's goal is to become a sponsor for others struggling with addiction. DuFour said Rider also hopes to participate in reunification therapy with his sons.\nA variety of people gave statements on Rider's character during the sentencing, including friends, family and counselors.\nRider said he was ashamed of his conduct, which has \"caused immense harm and pain\" in the lives of his wife and children. Before apologizing to his family, he said he has \"fallen very far\" and has reached out to get as much support as possible so he can continue down a road of recovery.\nBefore handing down the sentence, Ross called Rider's actions the night of the fire \"calculated,\" \"planned\" and \"self-serving.\" He said Rider has been given opportunities that most people don't get, including getting to begin rehab before being sentenced. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Several Mid-Shore owners, trainers and breeders performed well in those events as well as others on the card.\nIn the first parimutuel race on the card, trainer John Wagner of Centreville sent out a solid tandem that would garner second and fourth, respectively. Tony Babe (Jonathan Roberts) lived up to his billing as the 3-5 favorite to score in 1:55.4, while Wagner trainees Petes For Real (Fern Paquet Jr.) and Cloggs For Real (Corey Braden) finished second and fourth, respectively.\nThen two races later in the $87,500 MDSS final for 3-year-old colt and gelding trotters, Wagner trainees Geralds A Keeper (Trae Porter) and K J Dash (Victor Kirby) finished one-two as expected. Geralds A Keeper lived up to his role as the 3-5 favorite when he overcame post six to gain command early to carve out all the fractions en route to a 1:58 score, his sixth in seven starts this year.\nThen two races later in the $87,500 MDSS final for 3-year-old filly pacers, Yourgracefoundme (Eric Davis) finished second as an overlooked 36-1 shot as prohibitive 1-9 choice Fancy Like That (Johnathan Ahle) led throughout to prevail by seven lengths in 1:56 for owner-trainer Kasey Bendix. A sophomore daughter of Mr. Apples owned and bred by Jeffery Clark of Centreville, Yourgracefoundme sports a lifetime bankroll just shy of $100,000 from 21 starts.\nThen just past the midway point of the Wednesday card, Sinatra De Vie (Ahle) lived up to his role as the 4-5 favorite in the $12,000 Open Handicap Trot when he overcame his assigned post eight and rallied from last year and widest of all down the backside and through the far turn en route to a three-length score in 1:55.1.\nA 4-year-old son of Southwind Frank owned and trained by Eric Foster of Ridgely, Sinatra De Vie has won all four of his starts at Ocean Downs this summer and now sports eight wins and roughly $67,500 banked from 18 seasonal outings overall.\nSeveral races later, Walden Woods (Hugh O'Neil) easily lived up to his billing as the even-money favorite in the $10,000 Open II class for older pacers when he gained command immediately from the coveted rail and led throughout en route to a three-length score while stopping the timer in 1:54.1. A 6-year-old Betting Line gelding owned and trained by Samuel \"Wayne\" Young of Church Hill, Walden Woods recorded his third straight score over the seaside oval.\nThen one race later on the same card, Full Send (Russell Foster) easily lived up to his role as the even-money choice in a non-winners of $4,501 last four starts class for older pacers when he gained command through the clubhouse turn from the rail and led throughout en route to a three-length score in 1:52.4. A 7-year-old Western Ideal gelding trained by Eli Scott Jr. of Warwick, Full Send recorded his fifth win from 18 seasonal tries.\nLast Thursday evening at Harrington Raceway, a half-mile harness racing oval in southern Delaware, Curtsyforpurrseco (Tim Tetrick) easily lived up to her role as the 3-5 favorite in the $110,000 Delaware Standardbred Breeders Fund final for 3-year-old filly pacers when she overcame post eight to gain command before the opener in 28.4, carved out honest fractions then drew clear late to a four-length score while stopping the timer in 1:56.1.\nA sophomore daughter of Roddy's Bags Again trained by Jim King Jr. for owner Jo Ann Looney-King and bred by Winbak Farm in Chesapeake City, Curtsyforpurrseco completed a sweep of the DSBF spring series at Harrington and now owns five wins and just over $100,000 banked from 12 seasonal outings. She has also now won exactly one-half of her 22 career outings and boasts lifetime earnings just north of $200,000. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There, police found 24-year-old Tyuane Johnson of Cambridge with a gunshot wound to the right side of his head.Over 30 spent shell casings were observed by police in various areas around the scene.Police attempted lifesaving measures while waiting for paramedics.Johnson was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Dorchester, where he was pronounced dead.Autopsy results from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled Johnson's death a homicide from a gunshot wound.According to Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, police identified Savage in surveillance video of the shooting.L eonard said Savage fired a gun in the area, then fled toward a home on Greenwood Avenue.Savage was already prohibited from owning a firearm due to a previous conviction.During the shooting, Savage also sustained a gunshot wound to his left foot and left a trail of blood from the scene to Greenwood Avenue.In recommending the maximum penalty on the firearm charge, Leonard said Johnson's family was still not satisfied.In the months after the shooting, nearly a dozen men were arrested and charged in connection to Johnson's death and the chaotic scene that unfolded that night, including Savage.Charges against two of the men were eventually dismissed; others received time served sentences after pleading guilty to lesser charges. Three men were handed sentences ranging from 18 months to five years, to be served in state prisons.In September, Deondray Stanford, 23, of Cambridge, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter, the most significant punishment in the case.But to the family, no plea would ever fill the hole left by Johnson's death, Leonard said.Defense attorney Andrea Jaskulsky agreed that Johnson's death was a tragedy, but asserted that Savage was the intended target of the fatal shooting. Other men charged in connection to the shooting were upset with Savage for not intimidating a witness in a different court case, she said.It was \"impossible\" to tell what was going on from the surveillance video, Jaskulsky added.Savage spoke briefly, saying that he was only walking out of his front door and didn't intend to hurt anyone.Both Savage and Jaskulsky asked the judge for consideration for a work-release program, which was opposed by Leonard and denied by Dean, though Dean said she would recommend work programs for him.Savage will receive credit for the 16 months already served in the county jail since his arrest last July.He will also be required to submit to mental health and substance abuse evaluations. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Suicides are at record levels in the U.S.; Men, specifically white men, are driving the wave\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record number of Americans killed themselves last year, according to new suicide numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Who is driving the contemporary surge in suicides?\"Middle-age white males,\" said Dr.Caroline Fenkel, chief clinical officer and co-founder of Charlie Health Inc., a Bozeman, Montana-based mental and behavioral health provider specializing in virtual and outpatient care for kids, teens and young adults.Men made up 79.4% of the record 49,449 suicides committed nationally last year, according to the CDC. White men make up 30% of the U.S. population.They accounted for 60% (29,847) of the suicides last year, according to the CDC.Fenkel said men, especially white men, can feel the pressures of societal and throwback gender role expectations - and still not show stigmatized weaknesses of their mental health.Gender roles associated with career expectations in a market-based economy also play a role, Fenkel said, pointing to how society can look down at working class and lower-income men employed in some lower-paying service sector jobs.\"They are constantly told that they should be successful. That they should be making a lot of money. That they should be providing for or having a family,\" Fenkel said.Men tend to use guns to kill themselves compared to women who use other means such as attempting overdoses.\"Women are attempting suicides more often but don't succeed, while men tend to complete suicides at much higher frequency,\" said Dusti Linnell, an associate professor of practice with Oregon State University's College of Health. She helps lead the university's community mental and behavioral health efforts.\"The completions are associated with firearms,\" Linnell said.Guns were used in 54.6% of all U.S. suicides last year, according to the CDC data, outpacing other methods such as poisoning and overdoses (11.6%) and suffocations and self hangings (25.8%).Fenkel said men are more impulsive in their decisions to kill themselves - and are less likely than women to talk about their mental health challenges openly.\"They are really more likely to self-treat and to self medicate with alcohol,\" she said. \"I think they are less likely to ask for help in general.I think asking for help as a male is seen as a weakness.\" UPSETTING UPSWINGSuicides have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2000. There were 29,350 suicides reported by U.S. health agencies in 2000. They have increased 68.4% since then and 4.1% since 2019 before all the stressors and shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.The 2022 increases include noticeable jumps from 2021 among those ages 45-64 (6.6%) and 65 and older (8.1%) as well as Asians (5.7%) and Hispanics (4.3%).Those all outpace the overall 2.6% jump in suicides from 2021 to 2022.Linnell said she's seen worrisome increases in suicides and suicide attempts by farmers and others working in rural and outdoor vocations as well as continued mental health stigmas and a pronounced counselor shortages making it difficult for those in need to find help.Farmers, farm workers and others working outside have to deal with extreme weather changes including warmer temperatures as well as pesticides and other chemicals.Linnell said lingering stigmas about talking about mental health and suicidal thoughts can be magnified along with social isolations in smaller towns and rural regions.\"One of the most difficult things to say to another person is that you are thinking of killing yourself or harming yourself,\" she said.Fenkel said the shortage of mental and behavioral health workers is so pronounced that as many 150 million Americans live in \"mental health deserts\" where access to services and treatment can be scarce.SOLUTIONS?So what can be done?The growth of telehealth services born out of and magnified after the pandemic has improved access to mental and behavioral resources and sparked the growth of groups such as Montana-based Charlie Health, which was established in 2020.That can allow more therapists and counselors to live and work in smaller towns and rural areas while also seeing patients in bigger cities.It also can offer some privacy for those with mental and behavioral health challenges they might not trust sharing with family or employers. \"It can be embarrassing,\" Linnell said.She said Oregon State is part of efforts in the Pacific Northwest to implement and grow peer-based mental and behavioral health programs.Whether its middle-age or older men or teenagers, it can be easier to talk about sensitive topics such as suicide and self-harm with a friend than family members or employers.High schools and colleges are implementing peer-based mental health programs.Linnell said Oregon State is looking to grow peer-based \"Mental Health First Aid\" and QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) programs.The former entails a six-hour training programs to help participants to build skills to help friends and others in need while the other has shorter 90-minute programs aimed suicide prevention.A key goal is for those considering or recovering from self-harm to believe they can get better.\"It's so important for people to know that recovery is possible,\" she said. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/LENART LIPOVŠEK LENART /UNSPLASH.COM\n \nMen made up more than 79% of total suicides in the U.S. last year, according to provisional data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control. White men, who make up 30% of the total population accounted for 60% of the 49,449 suicides nationally, the agency said.\n \nAP PHOTO/MARK LENNIHAN, FILE\n \nA sculpture called the \"Vessel\" at the Hudson Yards development in New York City saw a series of suicides after opening in 2019.

It's the only municipality in Talbot County that does not have one.\n\"This would allow any municipality to have up to one Class E establishment, so that way, residents of Trappe would have the same access to a store that others in the county have,\" he said.\nTown residents currently have to drive to Easton or Cambridge to shop at a liquor store.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher emphasized that the council does not issue liquor licenses — the county liquor board does — but the bill enables that the board to be able to review one for the town.\n\"Without this legislation, a new business would not be possible,\" he said. \"So this is enabling legislation for sure.\"\nThe bill was approved unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But after some discussion from town residents, rules regarding chickens could change.\nAccording to town staff, the conversation has been ongoing through the past couple of months, but it gained traction after residents began preparing petitions and presentations on chickens.\nMason Sparks, a resident of the town, gave a presentation to the town on chickens at the commissioners' August meeting. At Monday's meeting, Sparks said that he knocked on 471 doors and received 178 responses from residents, 87.6% of whom were in favor of allowing chickens.\nResident Andrew Meyer also spoke on Monday in favor of chickens being allowed within the town limits.\n\"I just want to start by saying that I strongly support allowing chickens in town,\" Meyer said. \"There's towns and cities all over the country that currently allow chickens. Today, more and more people want to know where the food's coming from, and raising backyard chickens for eggs is one way that people can ensure that they have healthy raised source of food.\"\nMeyer addressed some concerns he said he has heard about chickens.\n\"As far as noise, hens are no louder than barking dogs or children playing. As far smells, a small backyard coop that's kept clean would have minimal smell. It's no more disturbing than any other farm smells that town is currently surrounded by. I think the benefits outweigh any small disturbance that would cause to any neighbors around the town.\"\nAfter hearing from residents, the commissioners voiced their opinions.\n\"It seems like the residents are definitely in favor,\" Commissioners Chad Leister said. \"I know that I personally reached out to all our neighboring town councils and spoke to them, mainly just to see, some I guess bad feedback they would have for the chickens, and, as you know, there wasn't really a whole lot of it. So, I think I'm willing to be okay with it.\"\nThe commissioners made a motion to work on the legal wording of the town code to draft an ordinance to allow chickens within the town. The ordinance is expected to be presented at the next meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We are so proud of and inspired by the veterans and service members on our team. This is just a great opportunity to honor them and let them know what they mean, n to us.\"In addition to lighting buildings and other meaningful landmarks, residents, businesses and other organizations are encouraged to participate by simply changing one light bulb in their home to a green bulb.This can be an exterior light that neighbors and passersby see or an interior light that sparks a conversation with friends.\"Operation Green Light is a gesture of support and appreciation for the public service of our veterans,\" said NACo Executive Director Matthew Chase. \"With hundreds of towns and counties coming together to light everything from bridges to courthouses, we know veterans across the country will see and feel the gratitude we all feel for their service and sacrifices.\"Counties and residents across the country are sharing their participation on social media using the hashtag #OperationGreenLight.For more information on Operation Green Light, visit https://veterans.mary-land.go v/op e ration-g reen-light/. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
