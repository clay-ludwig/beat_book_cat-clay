Duffy criticized the current air\u2011traffic\u2011control system and said, \u201cWe're at a point where we can do this fast\u2014three and a half to four years for a brand new air traffic control system. Gold plated. Envy of the world,\u201d promising a rapid upgrade. He added, \u201cIt will greatly improve our safety\u2026but it's also going to improve the efficiency that we have in American air travel, which I think will mean less delays, less cancellations, and again, better safety.\u201d Meanwhile, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has said the investigation will continue to \u201cdetermine what happened\u2026the how and why,\u201d reassuring travelers that \u201caviation is incredibly safe\u201d while acknowledging the need for improvements.",

The process will first remove the bridge deck over the river, then demolish sections over Hawkins Point and Sollers Point, with no controlled detonations. The demolition will also strip deck, barriers, parapets, girders, piers, and ultimately the north and south abutments, using excavators, concrete saws, vacuums, cranes, trucks, and an on\u2011site concrete crusher to recycle materials. Nearby communities will see tug and barge operations, heavy equipment, and safety buoys, with typical construction noise from 7\u202fa.m. to 7\u202fp.m. and baseline noise/vibration monitoring already underway; speed restrictions and safety zones will be posted to protect vessels and the public. The Authority will continue to update on any impacts and has requested permit modifications and a categorical exclusion reevaluation to reflect changes in pier design and environmental effects.",

The primary objective when we purchased this was the fact that it\u2019s 6.48 acres, in the middle of Four Corners, which is where we\u2019re growing and where our primary routes are.\u201d The building\u2019s strategic position within a nine\u2011mile radius of most calls helps deputies avoid traffic on 19th Avenue and Huffine Lane, and Springer highlighted that 70% of calls occur within that zone. The tour also included memorials for fallen deputies and a glimpse of future expansions such as a search\u2011and\u2011rescue building and a larger training campus.",

Ahlstrom, a mental\u2011health counselor with 25 years of nonprofit experience and a Master of Science in Counseling, said: \u201cI hope to help mitigate the upward trend in Human Trafficking by expanding For All Seasons Rape Crisis Center's outreach; and strengthening the medical, legal, social service, and mental health collaboration that has already been established to support survivors.I believe my counseling and education background, along with strong communication and networking skills will help facilitate the most effective trauma-informed response to serve victims and their families in the Mid\u2011Shore region and beyond,\u201d Ahlstrom said. She will coordinate with experts statewide to strengthen support networks and use her EFT/tapping skills to assist survivors. The article explains that the Eastern Shore\u2019s transportation links and seasonal economy make it a hotspot for trafficking, urging communities to learn how to identify victims. The organization invites people to learn more or request a presentation at WeSupportSurvivors.org or by emailing Ahlstrom.",

    "content": "Kevin McClain, 53, was arrested Oct. 27 in the 700 block of Race Street on 36 charges, including armed carjacking, armed robbery, assault, use of a firearm, reckless endangerment and theft. Police said the charges stem from an Oct. 3 incident where officers responded to the 400 block of Caribbean Avenue around 1:40 a.m. regarding an armed robbery. According to police, the victim reported that after leaving their residence with a friend, another male subject came from the side of the residence, approaching the victim and knocking them to the ground. Police said the victim reported that the teen pulled out a handgun pointing and threatening to shoot them as he went through the victim's pockets, taking their wallet and vehicle keys. An investigation determined the suspect with the gun was a 17-year-old boy from Cambridge who was arrested and charged as an adult, while McClain was identified as the \"friend\" of the victim. After being processed by CPD and having an initial appearance before a court commissioner, McClain was transported to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond.",

Hurley of the Fraternal Order of Police warns that Maryland\u2019s new juvenile-justice rules mean a youth who \u201cnot be charged with any crime is under 10 years old\u201d and that those under 13 can only be charged for violent crimes, leaving theft, burglary, drug and gun offenses unpunishable. He says officers must release even kids caught with loaded handguns or stolen cars, cannot interrogate anyone under 18 without a lawyer, and can only offer a social-services referral\u2014so gangs are already recruiting children as \u201ccareer criminals.\u201d",

She alleged Cabrera obtained the images from her while she was underage and distributed them on the messaging app Telegram, with the photos also surfacing on Instagram and Twitter. Cabrera was initially held without bond before posting $1,500 bond March 3; a preliminary hearing is set for March 31.",
