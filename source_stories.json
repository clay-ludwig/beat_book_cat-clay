Cawley spoke about the safety issue of cars driving too fast down Tilghman Street.To address these concerns, the town will be putting in stop signs at the intersection ofTilghman Street and Bank Street. On Thursday, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said in a text that the stop signs will be installed in the next few weeks.\"I think the first step really is to put up a stop sign at Tilghman and Bank,\" Commission President Tom Costigan said at the meeting on Tuesday. \"A three-way stop. Let's see if that works.\"Cawley came to the commissioners with speed data collected over a 13-day period in August as well as a proposal for a speed study from Traffic Concepts Inc. He said that in doing research, he found that the first step in getting the speed lowered from 25 miles per hour on Til-ghman Street would be to have a speed study done.\"Once the speed study is done, then we can reevaluate what the recommendations are and see if we can make some changes to get the speed lowered,\" he said.Cawley asked that, in the meantime, the town get speed feedback signs installed on the street.According to the speed data collected by the Oxford Police Department in August, of the 3,225 total vehicles counted, there were 73 speed violations. The max speed recorded was 36 miles per hour.During the meeting, Cawley pointed out that Tilghman Street is 17-feet wide without any shoulders or a continuous sidewalk.Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner said that sidewalks would be a benefit, considering all the pedestrians walking down Tilghman street in the summer.\"People walk up and down that road, tourists and locals alike,\" he said. \"Sidewalks would be a great thing to look at. But I also know that putting in sidewalks is not as easy as saying, 'We want a sidewalk.'\"The speed study proposed by Traffic Concepts Inc. would cost the town $3,100. From it, the town would receive the speed study results, the engineering firm's observations and a report \"that details the steps and reasoning used to establish the recommended speed limits.\"Costigan and Cawley agreed that if town opts to do the speed study, it should be done in the summer, when traffic is at its peak.Costigan said that while he didn't disagree with doing a speed study, putting up stop signs is a good first step.\"It's not an easy process,\" Costigan said about getting the speed lowered. \"But it's one we can certainly look into and try.\"Kellner said that once the stop signs are up, there will be a \"period of education\" for people to get used to the change before they begin ticketing people for failing to stop.Costigan said getting the stop signs installed now, rather than in June or July, is better because it will give drivers time to get used to the stop before the busy summer months.\"And who knows,\" he said. \"They may even like it.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGlE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nOxford resident Will Cawley speaks about his concerns with people driving too fast down Tilghman Street at a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Nov. 14. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was found guilty on all counts \u2014 which included first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, robbery and firearms charges \u2014 in both trials.\nA motion for a new trial for the death of Fields, filed by Williams' defense in late January, was denied at the sentencing hearing Monday.\nAccording to court documents, Williams' defense argued there was insufficient evidence to support that a robbery had occurred and that Williams had intended to kill or harm Fields. His defense included in the motion that evidence related to Daniels' death was \"unintentionally admitted and sent back\" to the jury in the trial for the death of Fields.\nAccording to court documents, in response, the state said the motion for a new trial should be denied because the evidence \"clearly supported a conviction on all counts,\" and said none of the jurors had knowledge of the Daniels case.\n\"'Taijay Daniels' would be nothing more than a 'John Doe' to the seated jurors,\" the state's response to the motion says.\nAt the sentencing hearing, Jones denied the request for a new trial. He said there was sufficient evidence to prove that Williams was responsible for the death of Fields.\nJones said there was an extensive voir dire to make sure no jurors in the Fields trial knew anything about the Daniels case. He said that when the document related to Daniels' death was given to the jury on the Fields case, the jury was told to disregard it.\n\"And they did,\" he said.\nBefore the sentencing was handed over on Monday, Williams was given the opportunity to speak. He said he was sorry to the families of Daniels and Fields, and maintained his innocence. Williams said he thought he could benefit from going to a psychiatric hospital.\nThe events that resulted in the deaths of Daniels and Fields took place on Dec. 8, 2022. That day, the Cambridge Police Department responded to two shootings in the span of a few hours.\nDuring the trial for Daniels' death, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said Daniels was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds on Pleasant Street, one of which was fired at close range.\nSurveillance footage shown in court showed Daniels' last minutes walking past a corner market, followed by Williams shortly after. A video from an apartment complex on Pleasant Street showed a man identified as Williams approaching Daniels with a gun. Daniels dropped his phone as Williams extended his arm, shooting him in the back.\nThen, Williams shot again, striking Daniels in the head twice before taking his belongings and leaving.\nDuring the trial for Fields' death, Leonard said Cambridge police had found Fields lying in his front yard. He had been shot once in the head at close range and robbed of the keys to his Chrysler 300, she said.\nPolice testified that Fields' car keys and Daniels' phone were recovered from Williams the night he was arrested.\nAt the sentencing hearing, members of both Daniels' and Fields' families spoke.\nDaniels' mother, Barbara Gabbin called her son a giver, adding that he was \"full of love.\"\n\"Taijay was my world,\" she said.\nFields' daughter Lauren Davis wrote a letter to her deceased father, which she read at the sentencing.\n\"I have been so lost without you,\" she said, later adding that she would give anything for just one more day, one more second with him. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The woman has yet to be located.Kenneth Stefan Bradley, 41, is charged with kidnapping, assault and related charges in connection to Tiyavauna Britt's disappearance.\nAn arrest warrant indicated Bradley was arrested in Anne Arundel County on Monday, Feb. 19. He was ordered held without bond during a bail review in Glen Burnie District Court that day, according to court records.\nBritt, who was first reported missing to the Easton Police Department on Tuesday, Feb. 13, remains \"critically missing,\" according to charging documents authored by a Maryland State Police sergeant.\nAccording to charging documents, Britt's mother told police she had attempted to contact her daughter several times between Jan. 31 and Feb. 13, but had not been able to reach her. Several other family members were unable to make contact with Britt, her mother told police.\nBritt's mother also told police that the car typically driven by Britt was found unoccupied in the Dollar Tree parking lot in Easton.\nThe car was found unlocked with Britt's belongings inside, including her phone and wallet.\nBritt's mother said she found a note in the driver's side door of the car that appeared to be \"a list of couple goals,\" according to charging documents. Police wrote that the end of the letter said \"No phones, no kids, just us.\"\nIt was not clear who authored the note.\nAccording to charging documents, Britt's mother believed her daughter was with her ex-boyfriend, identified as Bradley. The mother feared for her daughter's safety, citing previous domestic violence history between the two.\nBradley is currently on probation for a previous assault conviction related to Britt in Talbot County.\nIn early September 2021, police responded to an alleyway in Easton, where they found Britt crying. According to charging documents in that case, Britt told police Bradley was chasing her in his truck after the two got into an argument.\nBritt told police that Bradley pulled her hair, grabbed her by the throat and choked her. He also reportedly held a pillow over her face and mouth, threatening to kill her, and told her not to leave.\nBritt was found to have abrasions on her neck consistent with being choked, along with abrasions on her wrist and redness to the back of her neck at her hairline, police wrote.\nWhile that case was still pending, police were called to an apartment in Hurlock in April 2022 for another altercation between Bradley and Britt, though that case was later placed on the stet, or inactive, docket.\nBradley was convicted of second-degree assault in Talbot County Circuit Court in June 2022 and was sentenced to 10 years, with all but time already served suspended.\nHe was placed on three years of supervised probation and ordered to complete an abusers' intervention program, though a violation of probation report filed on Feb. 16 indicated he had not provided verification of completing the course.\nIn further investigating Britt's disappearance, police spoke with three other people who knew her, all of whom said they had last heard from or seen Britt on Wednesday, Feb. 7.\nBritt's employer told police she was seen leaving work in Delaware around 3 p.m. Surveillance footage from her employer showed Britt wearing a black coat and black sweatpants, police said.\nA woman who identified herself as Britt's cousin told police she was with Britt that afternoon and heard her and Bradley having a verbal argument on the phone before the couple planned to go to dinner at Portside in Cambridge.\nThe cousin told police Britt dropped her off in Hurlock around 6 p.m., according to charging documents. The two spoke on the phone for several minutes afterward.\nPolice said a man who identified himself as an acquaintance of Britt said he received a phone call from her shortly after 7:30 p.m. The man told police he briefly spoke with Britt before hearing a male voice, adding that he believed the man with her \"started to assault\" her before the call suddenly ended.\nDetectives obtained cell tower records for Britt's phone, giving police a timeline of events leading to the last time her phone was active, according to charging documents. Police wrote that Britt was in downtown Cambridge and Great Marsh Park that evening.\nThe last known cell tower location placed Britt's phone at Great Marsh Park shortly before 8:30 p.m. Feb. 7, police wrote.\nPolice also obtained cell tower data for Bradley's phone number, which placed him in the same area and locations as Britt during that time frame.\nOfficers from the Cambridge Police Department reviewed surveillance footage between Portside and Great Marsh Park, which showed a dark-colored Chevrolet Suburban pulling into the park shortly before 7:30 p.m.\nAccording to charging documents, a Black male was seen exiting the vehicle with a woman who appeared to have her hands bound. The man walked the woman to the rear of the vehicle, opening and closing the hatch, and walked her to the front of the vehicle \u2014 out of view of the camera, police noted.\nFurther review of the camera footage revealed audio of male and female voices. Police wrote that \"sounds of loud thuds\" also were heard, which \"appear to be consistent with forceful strikes.\"\nPolice interviewed a man connected to Britt on Feb. 16, who identified the voices as Britt and Bradley.\nCharging documents said a \"dark object\" was seen lying on the ground in front of the vehicle as it drove away shortly before 8 p.m. The same vehicle was seen returning about 25 minutes later.\nPolice wrote that the footage showed a male driver leaving the vehicle and walking toward the object. Within minutes, the man was seen \"carrying and dragging\" what appeared to be a \"small statured, light skinned female\" consistent with the woman observed in the videos.\nThe man later carried the woman's \"limp body\" to the rear cargo area of the vehicle, placing other unknown items there before leaving at 8:30 p.m.\nPolice have not shared further information on Britt. Anyone with knowledge of her whereabouts is asked to contact Maryland State Police.\nBradley is set to appear for a preliminary hearing in Dorchester County District Court on March 12. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many of the children involved utilized their entire budget to purchase gifts for their families instead of themselves.\nFortunately, their kindness did not go unnoticed and was rewarded. The chaperoning officers found it in their hearts to give them a little extra so everyone left with a gift of their own.\nIn addition to the officers chipping in, there were a few shoppers passing by who also donated their own funds to the cause.\n\"This is a good place we live in,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said. \"I've seen these kids looking out for their families instead of themselves, our officers reaching into their own wallets to make sure no one is left out, and even just some local townspeople going out of their way to do the same. It is really moving, and I'm proud to see it all.\" After the shopping was completed, the group returned to the Elks Lodge to get wrapping.\nTape, wrapping paper, bags and scissors were all deployed simultaneously as the officers, and their companions took all the gifts and did their best to make everything look beautiful enough to go under the tree.\nOnce completed, the officers and children enjoyed pizza and snacks together, before wrapping up the day by playing a spirited soccer match on the lawn outside.\nIn all her years organizing the event, Henckel said she always sees familiar faces among the officers.\n\"You see a lot of returning officers and you know that's because they care. It's nice to see their eagerness to be here with the kids,\" she said in a news release. \"They really make a difference to these kids, and around our community.\"\nHenckel thanked the Elks Lodge for donating the space, the Easton Walmart for making the event possible and the three police departments for joining forces.\n\" To have their support over the years means more than you know,\" she said. \n \n Caption: GREG MUELLER/TOWN OF EASTON\n\n Officer Cordero Proctor of the Easton Police Department does some holiday shopping alongside his partner at Walmart in Easton for the Talbot Optimist's Shop with a Cop event. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A K-9 search discovered \"suspected heroin/fentanyl mix,\" crack cocaine and ecstasy, police wrote.\nDuring the stop, police said Black was on his phone. Investigators eventually determined that Black called Wilson during that time. Black had Wilson make a call to 911 and report a fake shooting at the Easton Walmart, police said.\nOfficers went to the Walmart but found no evidence of shots fired.\nAccording to online court records, Black and Wilson both posted $10,000 unsecured personal bond since their arrests, meaning they will only have to pay the full amount if they fail to appear for a court date or break other conditions imposed by the court.\nWilson has a trial scheduled for Nov. 5 in Talbot County District Court. She faces four total charges: obstructing and hindering, making a false statement to officers, and two counts of possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.\nBlack's trial is scheduled for Nov. 3 in District Court. He faces the same four counts as Wilson.\nBlack, in a separate case in Talbot County Circuit Court, is also facing two felony, six misdemeanor and 11 traffic counts in connection to the same April 4 traffic stop. A jury trial for those charges is scheduled for Dec. 8.\nIn that case, he's charged with two felony counts of possession with the intent to distribute narcotics. Black posted $10,000 unsecured bond for those charges back in July. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

There were no deaths or injuries reported.One affected structure was a former butcher shop and storage building, and the other was a wooden-frame farm house next door. The combined loss of both buildings was estimated at $600,000. The contents within were valued at $250,000.\nIt took 75 firefighters three hours to control the fire, according to a release from the office of the State Fire Marshal. The Tanker Task Force was called in for additional water.\nAccording to the fire marshal's report, \"The fire originated inside the butcher shop shortly after the owner had been doing work inside. Embers from this fire landed on the cedar shingles of the vacant nearby 100+ year old home eventually spreading to the remainder of the house. Both structures are considered a total loss.\"\nThere were no smoke alarms present. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Human trafficking expert hired by For All Seasons\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A14 | Section: News \n \n 444\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - For All Seasons is part of the Governor's initiative, the Maryland Regional Navigator Program, serving human trafficking victims under the age of 24 in the Mid-Shore of Maryland.Although For All Seasons has been working with victims of human trafficking for years, this program connects its new human trafficking navigator, Susan Ahlstrom, with experts across the state to better support human trafficking victims on the Mid-Shore.Ahlstrom brings experience as a mental health and wellness counselor and is a certified EFT/tapping practitioner, most recently working as the T.A.M.A.R.(Trauma, Addiction, Mental Health, and Recovery) coordinator for female detainees at the Dorchester and Caroline county detention centers.She has over 25 years of experience working in nonprofit development, community building, education and youth advocacy.She holds a Master of Science in Counseling from the University of Hartford and a Bachelor of Arts in English from William Smith College in New York.\"I hope to help mitigate the upward trend in Human Trafficking by expanding For All Seasons Rape Crisis Center's outreach; and strengthening the medical, legal, social service, and mental health collaboration that has already been established to support survivors.I believe my counseling and education background, along with strong communication and networking skills will help facilitate the most effective trauma-informed response to serve victims and their families in the Mid-Shore region and beyond,\" Ahlstrom said.Human trafficking involves using force, fraud or threats to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act against a person's will, often for little or no pay, or something of value such as food, shelter, clothes, or drugs. It is a crime whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of adults or children. All persons under age 18 who exchange sex for something of value are human-trafficking victims regardless of the presence of force, lies or threats. A child cannot legally consent to commercial sex.The Eastern Shore is an attractive place for trafficking because of its geographic location in proximity to transportation routes by land, air and sea that offer opportunities for human traffickers to go undetected.Major highways like I-95, Routes 40, 50, 301, and 13 all make transporting victims and meeting buyers easy. In addition, three major international airports, inexpensive bus transportation, train service, and a high rate of seasonal work, make Maryland attractive to human traffickers.To learn about how to identify possible human trafficking victims, the industries where human trafficking most likely occurs, and ways to help, visit WeSupportSurvivors.org. If you would like more information or would like to request an anti-human trafficking presentation for your place of work or community, email Susan Ahlstrom at sahlstrom@forallseasonsinc.org. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nSusan Ahlstrom is For All Seasons' new human trafficking navigator. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a great little town.\" \"I'm going to stay and watch this thing grow, and continue to give excellent service to the citizens and the town,\" Trams said.\"We're very proud to have you, and you're doing a fantastic job,\" Town manager Tammy Kelledes said.Several town employees attended the ceremony. Paugh thanked them and said, \"I want to thank you guys for taking your time out of your busy Monday to join Lenox on his special day. It's been a long time coming.\" \"Even though it's been a short period of time in Greensboro, you definitely made an impact in the community,\" he told Trams.\"I'm always stopped and told about how well you're doing and how you interact with the community, and that's huge. And that's who you are. You're Mr. Community Policeman,\" Paugh said.\"You've done some amazing things, and you're worthy of the rank.\" Trams joined the Greensboro Police Department with Paugh seven months ago.Most of their law enforcement careers were spent with the Easton Police Department.Trams, 48, was a police officer in Easton for 22 years, completing his career there as a school resource officer at Easton Middle School.Paugh, 50, a 26-year veteran of the Easton Police Department, is leaving soon to join the Caroline County Sheriff's Office as commander of criminal investigations and a lieutenant, the same rank he attained with the EPD.In only seven months, Paugh said, \"We made a big impact.\" \"We completely redid all the cars - the technology in them. Everything is up to date,\" he said. \"We got a new CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system, new body cameras, new in-car cameras, all new computer systems\" - all updates the department \"very, very much\" needed. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nGreensboro Police Chief George Paugh, right, pins lieutenant bars on uniform of Lt.

Wes Moore (D) to \"immediately demand the resignation\" of Vincent Schiraldi, secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services.The Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline County sheriffs, along with all but five other Maryland sheriffs, voted Monday to have the Maryland Sheriffs' Association send the governor a letter to this effect.\n\"Since Schiraldi's appointment in 2022, his extreme policies and lack of leadership as the Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, have directly made communities less safe in Maryland,\" the letter reads.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" it later states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nA statement from Moore's office noted that \"over the past year,\" the governor has made a \"concerted effort\" to hold youth accountable and rehabilitate offenders. The statement highlighted a \"26% decline in juvenile homicide arrests and 46% decline in non-fatal shootings of juveniles\" statewide.\nThe statement did not directly respond to the Maryland Sheriffs' Association's request for Moore to call for Schiraldi's resignation.\n\"The governor is fully committed to working with local elected officials, law enforcement, the judiciary, and community leaders to improve public safety by holding youth accountable and rehabilitating them,\" it reads.\nThe Department of Juvenile Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the sheriffs' letter.\nSchiraldi, who was officially appointed to the position by Moore in March 2023, has indicated in other media interviews that he has the governor's support and is planning to \"stay in his job.\"\n\"Gov. Moore has been extremely supportive,\" Schiraldi told WBAL-TV on Friday afternoon. \"He's gotten us additional funds this year \u2014 $17 million to make community safer by expanding programs \u2014 and I want those community members who are calling for my resignation to feel safe.\"\nSHERIFFS WEIGH INThe Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot sheriffs said their votes to send the letter to Moore were prompted by negative impacts on local communities during Schiraldi's tenure as Department of Juvenile Services secretary.\nDorchester County Sheriff James Phillips said he \"lost all respect\" for Schiraldi following an in-person community meeting the secretary attended around a year ago.\n\"He had the audacity to tell us, \u2026 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nPhillips said in Dorchester County, \"we're dealing with the same people, the same names, the same age kids.\"\n\"The law-abiding citizens are suffering because of their ignorance and stupidity in protecting these criminals,\" Phillips said. \"And that's all they are. They might only be 15 or 16, but they're thugs.\"\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble says there's \"no accountability,\" noting that his office was recently involved in a vehicle chase in which a juvenile had an ankle monitor with batteries that hadn't been replaced for two months.\nGamble said the Mid-Shore has \"good\" juvenile services workers, \"but they're being hampered by the secretary.\" He pointed to Talbot Teen Court, a first-time program for juvenile offenders of misdemeanor crimes, as more successful in rehabilitating youth compared to the state's services.\n\"They're getting more community service and stuff out of Teen Court than they would ever get out of DJS,\" Gamble said. \"It's just a failed system. And it's being led by what the Sheriffs' Association believes is a bad pick by the governor.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker said recent justice reform \u2014 particularly Maryland's Child Interrogation Protection Act \u2014 has decreased the ability of police to hold juveniles accountable.\nThat act, enacted in 2022, restricts police from questioning a child without first talking to the parent or guardian's attorney or the Office of the Public Defender. Baker said it's a \"shame when parental rights are superseded by the legislature.\"\nBaker, who serves on the state's juvenile justice reform commission, believes the General Assembly has a \"role to play\" in improving juvenile reform moving forward.\n\"Juvenile reform needs to be a high priority to help take the steps needed for them to have accountability for when they step into adulthood,\" Baker said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That continues to be the case,\" Weber said. \" \u2026 There's a complexity to human trafficking that it doesn't really know county boundaries.\"\nWeber and Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications, each said the organization has a special role given its wide reach. For All Seasons' presence in the five Mid-Shore counties \u2014 Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot \u2014 is critical to providing victims with essential services.\n\"We know that human trafficking knows no boundaries and that it affects people of different backgrounds, races, genders,\" Theeke said. \"We have seen several cases come through our doors, and it comes from Talbot County. It comes from neighboring counties. We really aim to be the connector to get those people the help that they need.\"\nCouncil Member Keasha Haythe asked if For All Seasons is seeing a decline in human trafficking numbers. Weber said it's a \"double-edged sword.\"\n\"A year ago we sat in front of you and said, when we look at our rape crisis center data, a good fifth of what was coming in was having at least one indicator of human trafficking,\" Weber said. \" \u2026 That persists.\"\nThe organization has noticed a shift in how many people are recognizing signs of human trafficking and making those reports, Weber says.\n\"The folks that are self-referring, we're seeing a decline,\" she said. \"But we're seeing a real rapid incline in folks coming to us and saying, 'Hey, I know more and now I've seen something.'\"\nWeber said that since September, more than 120 people have taken For All Seasons' free, online anti-human trafficking course.\nFor All Seasons is an official regional navigator for the Mid-Shore area, Theeke said, meaning it works on task forces and serves youth and young adults that are victims of trafficking.\nAt the end of the discussion, council members thanked the For All Seasons representatives for their work and presented the organization with a proclamation Tuesday declaring January as National Human Trafficking Awareness Month.\n\"We know that even one victim is too many,\" council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"We appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As other units arrived, a perimeter was set up and K-9 units were called to assist along with aviation units.After about three hours of law enforcement officers' searching the area, Hockensmith was unable to be located.Investigators learned the vehicle Hockensmith was operating had been reported stolen, according to the police report.\"The vehicle was reported stolen to the Denton Police Department by Hertrich Chevrolet (in Denton), and we actually located another vehicle on the property that was stolen from them that they didn't even know about,\" Baker said.On Monday, Aug. 21, Delaware State Police posted on its Facebook page a request for help from the public in locating Hockensmith, who \"has three active felony warrants for his arrest for a host of offenses, including theft, burglary and a police pursuit.\" The Caroline County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigation Division responded back to the Marydel property where the incident began. A second vehicle was located and recovered that also had been reported stolen through the Denton Police Department.As a result of the on-scene investigation, deputies arrested a female associate of Hockensmith identified as Danyeal L. Shahan. Shahan is being charged with motor vehicle theft and related charges. Shahan was wanted through the state of Delaware. She is being held on bond at the Caroline County Detention Center, according to Baker.The Caroline County Sheriff's Office has active warrants for Hockensmith \"for the two motor vehicle deaths (of) two brand new cars from Hertrich Chevrolet here in Denton,\" Baker said.This is an active investigation and anyone with information is asked to contact the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515. \n \n Caption: TODD RANDALL HOCKENSMITH\n \nDANYEAL SHAHAN \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the snapshots were proudly displayed on her walls.\n\"I cried, cried, cried,\" Demdy said as she watched firefighters extinguish the last remaining embers at 17 South Locust Lane, many of her belongings strewn across the front yard of the early 20th century house. \"I had everybody's picture on the wall. My walls were just full of pictures.\"\nDemdy's home of 27 years was one of two houses that caught fire a little before 3 p.m. Saturday. It was the second house fire that Demdy had experienced in her life. Her home a few streets over had been lost to a fire three decades prior.\nFirefighters were dispatched to the blaze at 3:07 p.m., by which time, neighbors said, flames were spreading quickly between the two structures.\nBoth Demby, who lived alone, and the family who lived next door were able to make it out of the houses, and emergency officials on the scene said that no serious injuries were reported.\nIt took firefighters a little more than two hours to control the blaze. Responding fire departments began to gather their equipment and leave the scene a little before 5:30 p.m.\nSeven local fire departments responded to the fire \u2014 the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, the Cordova Volunteer Fire Company, the St. Michaels Fire Department, the Preston Volunteer Fire Company, the Oxford Fire Company, the Queen Anne-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company and the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, along with local EMS and law enforcement personnel.\nThe state fire marshal is conducting an investigation into the fire and its causes, the results of which will be available at a later date.\nThough exact damages are yet to be determined by the fire marshal, both houses sustained significant damage, and all residents of the structures were displaced.\nDemdy said she would be staying with a relative near Salisbury, and arrangements were made for her neighbors. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's not all fun and games,\" Tyree said. \" \u2026 When they go into a situation, there's a lot of thinking behind it because they can't violate procedure. If they violate procedure, they can't be a police officer.\"\nJunior Canin Parks said he took the academy to learn more about law enforcement since he is considering entering the field. His favorite week was the virtual reality simulator, during which students were posed with the virtual task of helping people in distress.\nJules Stepp, a Saints Peter & Paul junior, most enjoyed learning about Talbot County's crisis response unit, or SWAT team. Students were shown the inside of a SWAT van and learned about the materials and techniques used in situations that call for crisis response.\n\"It was like we were there with them,\" Stepp said. \"We got to live vicariously through them.\"\nStepp said she recommends the academy to anyone interested. The academy made it clear the extreme level of detail that policing requires, she said.\n\"I was surprised how much detail went into every little thing, and how one little thing can cause a problem so they had to backtrack and think about what the consequences could be,\" she said. \"And how they have to go through so many processes to get grants, peace orders, protective orders and all that type of stuff.\"\nFollowing Tuesday's 10th and final class, Maj. Steve Elliott thanked the students and called them a \"great group\" for the first ever citizens police academy. Lt. J.R Dobson said it was a fun 10 weeks.\n\"I think from day one \u2014 when (Sheriff Joe Gamble) was giving you guys a lesson on when the first sheriff of Talbot County was \u2014 until now, I've seen you all loosen up,\" Dobson said.\nGamble thanked Lori Stepp, the grants administrator for the Sheriff's Office, for procuring a grant to make the police academy possible.\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office is now fielding applications for its second citizens police academy. This round is open to county residents 18 and older. Classes are held every Tuesday for 10 weeks beginning April 8. Applications are open until March 31.\nGraduates of the inaugural Talbot County Sheriff's Office citizens police academy:\nYvonne Herrera Hernandez, North Caroline High School.\nIan Knopp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEric Loredo, Easton High School.\nSofia Miller, St. Michaels Middle High School.\nCanin Parks, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nJules Stepp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nCarson Tyree, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEvelio Urdaneta Delgado, Easton High School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hosted by Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 108, the event's location has varied through the years. It was held this year at the Centreville United Methodist Church.\nThe event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence led by Sheriff Gary Hoffman. Senior Pastor Rev. Karen Handy of Centreville Methodist Church welcomed and addressed families, friends and community members.\nChase Armington, past president of Lodge 108 and current Queen Anne's County deputy began, \"Tonight, we gather to honor our fallen heroes. It is our duty to never forget them, for they have paved the path forward with their lives. The path leading us here tonight was born from tragedy. Incredible losses. Unbearable pain for our families, friends, and the community. These honored in front of you served our community with pride, dignity, and honor. Knowing their lives could, at any moment be taken, so that we may live. So that we may continue on the path they have now paved.\"\nSue Nickerson, who lost her son, Centreville Police Officer Michael Nickerson, in 2001 explains, \"The FOP from QAC started (this event) and they will always have it on February 13, the night that Michael (Nickerson) and Jason (Schwenz, Queen Anne's County deputy) were killed. But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County.\"\nAs a mother who lost her son, this event is near to her heart. Nickerson said, \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\"\nFirst responders marched in for the Presentation of Colors, holding flags to honor those lost in the line of duty.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson spoke about stoicism and how it applies here. \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\"\nDuring this powerful remembrance, family members came, first responder representatives saluted and all placed long-stemmed red roses by the framed photographs.\nThe names of the fallen heroes were read along with the date of their End of Watch.\nTen Queen Anne's County residents and fallen heroes' pictures filled the front table: Queen Anne's-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company's Daniel Lister, Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company's \"Buck\" Clough, Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department's \"Dougie\" Thomas, United Community Volunteer Fire Department's David Brinkley, Centreville Police Department's Michael Nickerson, QA Sheriff's Deputy Jason Schwenz, DNR Warden Charles Rider, and Maryland State Police troopers Thomas Noyle, Philip Russ and Wallace Mowbray.\nRadio transmission echoed for all to hear to mark the ultimate sacrifice given on that fateful Feb. 13, 2001, \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Bagpipes played 'Amazing Grace' from the balcony overhead. Silence filled every space of the church.\nHandy closed, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

An autopsy revealed that Woolford died from a single gunshot wound from a .40 caliber firearm.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard provided a statement following the sentencing of Johnson.\n\"The State recommended a sentence of life imprisonment, suspending all but forty years of active incarceration,\" the statement read. \"The Court heard heartfelt victim impact statements from three members of the victim's family, each expressing their choice to forgive Mr. Johnson, and each requesting the Court consider a lesser period of active incarceration for Mr. Johnson given his cooperation and remorse.\n\"The State continues to offer condolences to all family and loved ones impacted by the loss of Ja'Len Woolford, and thanks the Court for its mindful consideration of all circumstances at sentencing.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It caused some havoc in a few of our schools, Breeding said. \"I think Colonel Richardson Middle, Colonel Richardson High, and Greensboro Elementary had to react and make some changes. But I think all in all we got through it okay.\"\nCaroline County and the town of Denton offered warming shelters for those without power. Wharves of Choptank Visitor & Heritage Center and General James F.

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Also taking the oath of office was Greensboro Police Sgt. Jake Smith. The ceremony and meet and greet preceded the town's first meeting of 2024.\nTrams, 48, has a 25-year career in law enforcement. He joined the GPD in March 2023. \"(Chief Paugh) did a lot of work to get us up to standards,\" Trams told attendees, adding he would continue that trend.\nTrams said he wants to fill out the department with three more officers. \"We want the best officers who can do the job that the town deserves,\" he said.\nSeveral of Trams' former colleagues from the Easton Police Department were on hand to applaud Trams' swearing-in, including Spencer, who was EPD police chief before retiring in Dec. 2022; Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner, Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker; and former Greensboro Police Chief Lt. George Paugh, who hired Trams to the GPD and moved on in November 2023 to become commander of the criminal investigation division in the Caroline County Sheriff's Office.\nSeveral of Trams' family members attended, and Trams' law enforcement colleagues shared their thoughts.\nUpon joining the EPD, Sgt. Al Orrison said Trams offered him his trademark strong handshake and \"took me under his wing. My kids actually call him Uncle Lenox. I love this man.\"\nOrrison said Trams had not become cynical after so many years in law enforcement.\n\"When you get to that 15-, 20-year mark, you become very cynical, and it's hard to have compassion all the time,\" he said. \"But Lenox Trams always has compassion for everyone. He treats everybody fairly, and he's just an incredible human being.\"\nEPD Sgt. David Trevino said Trams has \"endless energy\" and \"never stops giving to people\" through mentoring and volunteer work.\n\"The town of Greensboro is very fortunate,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 2025's first quarter alone, she was deployed 17 times, making six drug arrests alongside her handler, Pfc. Mark Schinault.\n\"She has that drive for her reward, her toy after she does a good scan,\" Schinault said. \"That means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\"\nKnox is part of Easton's new guard of K-9s. Last year, three dogs trained in marijuana detection were forced into early retirement due to the legalization of recreational cannabis use legalization in Maryland, which took effect July 2023.\nEaston is not the only agency looking to rebuild its K-9 team in the wake of the legislation. Across the state, law enforcement agencies are working to fund and fill their K-9 units, which serve crucial roles not only in deterring crime, but also in connecting with the community.\nPolice officers largely agree that dogs trained to sniff marijuana can't be used to detect drug offenses any longer, nor does the dogs' expertise hold up in court.\n\"I really didn't want to go down the road because I didn't want to be challenged in the courtroom,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\nKnox joined K-9 Waylon in Easton, and soon two other young dogs not imprinted on marijuana will fill out the town's K-9 unit. Lt. Tim Larrimore said it has been a \"complete rebuild\" for the unit since the law passed.\nTrained dogs can sometimes cost around $14,000, Larrimore said. Younger, untrained pups are significantly less, though they require major time commitments for training and certification.\nAcross the state, the work of K-9 dogs \u2014 depending on their training \u2014 often includes drug sniffing, tracking of suspects or missing subjects, and explosives detection. Knox is certified in drug detection and on her way to certification in tracking.\nSchinault and Knox completed more than 60 hours of one-on-one training before she was certified in drug detection. Easton opted to go with untrained dogs to save costs and build rapport between K-9s and officers.\nWhile Maryland K-9s are no longer sniffing for marijuana, Larrimore says their work is more important than ever in combating drug offenses.\n\"This odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search. Now that's out,\" Larrimore said. \"So now you need the ability to smell something that the human nose isn't necessarily good at detecting. It's the dog that gets you there.\"\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nKent County Sgt. Scott Lockerman has a passion for not just his K-9 partner, Khari, but for all police dogs across the state. He is president of the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps police agencies buy, train and protect their four-legged workers. The foundation paid for one of Easton's new dogs.\nLockerman said that after the legalization of cannabis, there was roughly a 60-40 split of agencies that could quickly get their K-9 units back on track versus those that were more affected by unexpected retirements. But he said progress is being made across all departments.\n\"Most of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\" Lockerman said.\nAt the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, one K-9 retired early after the cannabis law was passed, while multiple dogs retired shortly before. The agency worked ahead to bring in replacement dogs not trained to detect marijuana so the state legislation didn't present too many challenges.\n\"We saw it coming,\" Sheriff James Phillips said. \"It was on the horizon.\"\nSix K-9s currently work for the Dorchester Sheriff's Office. Three can assist in patrols and narcotic detection, two work in narcotics only, and one bloodhound specializes in tracking. Phillips said the office has adequate funding to fill its seventh and final spot for a K-9 trained in detecting explosives.\nFunding often comes from grants, local donations, organizations such as the K9 Foundation and county councils. Phillips said it's \"mind-boggling\" how generous people have been in donating dogs to the Sheriff's Office.\nIn addition to purchasing the dogs, agencies pay for safety equipment (like bulletproof vests) and health payments. Departments are also on the hook for vet costs incurred by retired dogs, per state law. For a retired K-9, departments could pay up to as much as $2,500 a year, capped at $10,000 per dog.\nLarrimore, the Easton lieutenant, says that hasn't yet presented a major funding challenge, though it could down the road.\n\"It hasn't hit us yet,\" he said. \"These dogs are just retired last year. They're young, they're healthy.\"\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT\nWhen the highly-skilled dogs aren't working a case, they're often out in the community showing more of their friendly side.\nIn Dorchester County, Sgt. Steve Twilley says the K-9 unit bridges the gap between the Sheriff's Office and the community. The dogs especially help police build trust with kids.\n\"Next thing you know, that kid's come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school,\" Twilley said.\nSchinault and Knox attended a recent Coffee with a Cop event this spring. Schinault said they're very involved with community policing efforts.\nPhillips and Twilley say the same is true in Dorchester County. Whatever dollar amount is spent on police dogs, Phillips says, comes back to the Sheriff's Office \"10 times over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people.\"\n\"I think an agency that's trying to do today's police work and doesn't have the K-9 ability out there, I don't think they're a full police agency,\" Phillips said. \"I think it completes the police agency by having the K-9s.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Life-saving measures were initiated; however, Parsley was pronounced dead at the scene.\nIn a statement issued by the Sheriff's Office Wednesday, Oct. 8, police said detectives from the Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigation Unit immediately launched an investigation, working closely with multiple federal, state and local partners. The investigation was conducted with the collaborative support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Baltimore-Annapolis Field Office, the Chesapeake Bay Safe Streets Task Force, Homeland Security Investigations' Baltimore Eastern Shore Field Office, the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, Centreville Police Department, Delaware State Police, Delaware Information and Analysis Center, Delaware State Police Governor's Task Force, Delaware Probation and Parole, Seaford Police Department and the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office.\nAfter an extensive investigation, the case was brought before a Queen Anne's County grand jury. The grand jury returned indictments, and on Oct. 6, arrest warrants were issued.\nAndrews, of Seaford, Delaware, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (two counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (four counts), second-degree assault (four counts), reckless endangerment (four counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (four counts), handgun on person (two counts), handgun in vehicle, loaded handgun in vehicle, and possession of a firearm as a minor.\nLawson, of Queenstown, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (four counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (five counts), second-degree assault (five counts), reckless endangerment (five counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (five counts), conspiracy to alter physical evidence to avoid criminal prosecution, handgun on person (two counts), loaded handgun on person, possession of a firearm as a minor, and possession of a firearm without a serial number.\nLissau, of Centreville, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (four counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (five counts), second-degree assault (five counts), reckless endangerment (five counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (five counts), conspiracy to alter physical evidence to avoid criminal prosecution, loaded handgun on person (two counts), and possession of a firearm without a serial number.\nAll three were taken into custody and held without bond.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said, \"This has been an incredibly difficult time for Chris' family and for our entire community. The effects of this tragedy have been deeply felt, and our thoughts remain with those who continue to grieve. This investigation reflects the strength of collaboration between our community and our law enforcement partners.\n\"As the investigation continues, every tip, video, and witness account remains vital to bringing closure for Chris's family and our community. We have zero tolerance for crime in Queen Anne's County and will always stand up for victims who no longer have a voice.\"\nThe investigation into the death of Parsley remains ongoing.

Brian McNeill, two cadets from the police academy and one current Sheriff's Office deputy.\nAt prior meetings, town officials expressed that Federalsburg was pursuing the agreement with the Sheriff's Office to save money on policing services as part of a plan to tackle the town's $5 million debt.\nThe agreement is set to last for a year, and council members said at prior meetings that regular check-ins will be held with the public.\n\"We felt as we wanted to give this MOU situation a try for a year, and throughout that year we want to have quarterly meetings with the public,\" Council Member Brandy James said at an Aug. 3 meeting.\nAccording to the MOU, the cost of the Sheriff's Office coverage for one year would be about $863,000. The town currently pays $1.146 million for the Federalsburg Police Department annually.\nThe cost saving of $280,000 is slitting less than the projected savings made at a prior public forum. On July 21, Council Member Ian Furgerson said if the town were to sign an MOU with the Sheriff's Office, it would save the town between $300,000 and $500,000 per year.\nAccording to town officials, during a meeting with Sheriff Donnie Baker, there were discussions of potentially utilizing half of the police department building as a space for the town and the other half to house the Sheriff's Office deputies.\nUnder the draft agreement, the town would provide its police vehicles for the station officers, with line items to be paid by the town for gas and maintenance. The town would pay a $15,000 line item for uniforms for officers.\nThe Sheriff's Office would manage press releases for criminal events, while the town would handle releases related to town events.\nA motion was made to move forward the modified agreement after Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan makes some modifications for clarity. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Funds will be used for traffic calming measures, bicycle network improvements, sidewalk enhancements and pedestrian safety measures near Mount Rainier Elementary School.\nThe Town of Brentwood received $160,000 to develop a Vision Zero Action Plan.\n\"As a historically disadvantaged community, we're grateful for this federal investment and support of our county and state partners so that we can deliver safety for our residents, businesses and visitors,\" Brentwood Mayor Rocio Treminio-Lopez said. \"While a small town, we have urban issues that need collaborative approaches to solve.\"\nBaltimore County received $3.5 million to put toward developing a Vision Zero Action Plan.\n\"Investing in our roadways not only improves vital infrastructure, but prioritizes the safety and wellbeing of our residents and communities,\" Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski said. \"We are grateful to our federal and state partners for their help with the critical planning projects supported with this grant - and for helping to ensure Baltimore County's roads are safe for years to come.\"\nQueen Anne's County received a grant of $280,000 to develop a comprehensive multimodal safety plan.\n\"This federal grant will help our local, state and federal partners combine knowledge and resources to create a comprehensive highway safety plan that will improve safety for our citizens and everyone traveling though Queen Anne's county,\" Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jim Moran said.\nThe City of Cambridge received a grant of $320,000 for research on ways to reorganize its streets to make them safer and more pedestrian-friendly.\n\"We have a number of streets and intersections that are really quite dangerous, especially to pedestrians,\" Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said. \"We're grateful for the funding.

According to reports from local police, the accident is still under investigation.Onlookers from the scene said it looked as though the truck carrying a load of corn tried to cross in front of the oncoming train.\nUltimately the tractor-trailer made it successfully only half way across the tracks before being struck by the train. Nealson Street at Broad Street remained closed for hours while clean up was conducted. No injuries were reported.\nLeon Guin works as a jockey driver at Amick Farms on Nealson Street near where the accident happened. He said he saw the accident just after it happened.\n\"Our security guards heard the accident,\" he said, \"and two of our outside drivers saw and heard it also. They were bringing the chickens in at that time.\"\nFrom Guin's point of view, he could see the truck cab and front portion of the trailer wrapped around the side of the train. The covered load had spilled alongside the train tracks and the truck cab twisted so it looked as though the truck was driving on the tracks.\nPresident and General Counsel for Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company Cathrin Banks stated she had reason to believe the operators of the train did everything they were supposed to do approaching the crossing.\nPolice had to close access at the Nealson Street entrance of Amick, but operations continued via the Route 392 and Delaware Avenue entrance. Four hours later, Guin was leaving work and clean up operations were still continuing, he said.\nAt press time, Hurlock's Chief of Police Bruce Jones said he was not yet able to release further details of the accident, including the name of the truck driver and company they were hauling for. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No injuries occurred, according to the Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nThe church, located east of Trappe in the village of Bruceville, suffered $25,000 in damages, the fire marshal reported.\nThe Rev. Gary Moore said the damage is \"very, very significant\" for the small church, which dates to the 1880s.\n\"I was there last night,\" Moore said in an interview Wednesday. \"Assessing the building will be a difficult decision as we move into the future.\"\nThe Trappe Volunteer Fire Company was assisted by local fire departments in extinguishing the fire. It took around 20 minutes to control, the fire marshal's report stated.\nMoore thanked fire crews for their quick response.\n\"It's what makes living in Talbot County a joy,\" he said.\nSunday morning services at the Bruceville church will be moved to Trappe United Methodist Church on Maple Avenue, Moore said.\nOTHER DAMAGES\nElsewhere in Talbot County, around nine trees fell due to the storm, according to Talbot County Emergency Services Director Brian LeCates. There were also downed wires, some flooding and minor car accidents, he added.\n\"We had a total of 24 incidents that were storm-related,\" LeCates said. \"Most of them are trees down with wires and then just flooding on streets down in Oxford and here in Easton.\"\nCommerce Drive in Easton was temporarily closed due to flooding Tuesday night, according to the town's Facebook. It reopened shortly after closing.\nThe St. Michaels town office will be closed Thursday due to repairs to an electric pole lost in the storm, the town announced Wednesday. Repairs won't cause any other outages, the town said.\nJimmy Windsor, Dorchester County's emergency management planner, said there were no reports of major flooding or significant storm damages. He said there was tree damage in northern parts of the county, but no serious incidents.\nIn Caroline County, a few trees were downed but mostly cleared out of roadways by mid-Wednesday morning.\nAn Easton Utilities spokesperson said two customers experienced power outages Tuesday night. Easton Utilities President and CEO John Horner cited the organization's efforts to provide reliability.\n\"Every upgrade we make strengthens our system, reduces outages, and ensures we're prepared to meet growing demands,\" Horner wrote in a statement.\nThunderstorms in the area are expected to continue Wednesday. According to a briefing from the National Weather Service's Mount Holly/Philadelphia office, Caroline and Talbot counties are under a flood watch alert from 5 p.m. Wednesday to 2 a.m. Thursday.\nLeCates stresses residents should avoid driving through flooded waters and take precautions even when home during thunderstorms.\n\"Prepare your homes for loose objects that will be blowing around,\" LeCates said. \"Secure loose objects.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This week's Star Democrat headlines make that clear.In Ridgely, town employees and officials have filed a motion to dismiss a federal lawsuit brought by the town's former police chief and officers. The plaintiffs argue the town violated their due process rights when the entire department was laid off last year, while the town maintains it was acting according to its charter and applicable laws.\nMeanwhile, in Greensboro, the police department has tripled in size this year. Police Chief Lenox Trams, who in January was the department's sole officer, welcomed a third officer this month who joins the department from the now-defunct Federalsburg Police Department.

Thompkins began striking the woman with his fists, then brandished a knife to stab her neck.The woman ran from her vehicle and collapsed in the front yard of a nearby house. Thompkins cradled her while holding the knife to his own throat, Franklin said.A witness attempted to help the victim but Thompkins threatened them, pointing the knife at them and yelling for them to get back.Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police and Maryland Natural Resources Police, responded to the stabbing.Franklin said Thompkins punctured his own neck with a knife while running to the woods, evading officers.After 15 minutes and the use of multiple non-lethal methods, including a taser, to diffuse the situation, a state trooper was able to knock the knife out of Thompkins' hand to detain him, police said.Both Thompkins and the woman were flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore for treatment of their injuries.Following his arrest, a judge found Thompkins incompetent to stand trial in April 2022.He was committed to the Maryland Department of Health until August of this year, then transferred back to a local detention center upon being found competent, according to court filings.In court Monday, Franklin said he will recommend a 30-year sentence with all but 15 years of active incarceration suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation and special mental health conditions.State sentencing guidelines recommend five to 10 years, said Jesse Hicks, Thompkins' attorney. The plea is not binding, meaning a judge has the ability to impose a higher or lower sentence than what is recommended.Sentencing will be deferred until Feb. 1, 2024. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER\n \nPolice on scene in Preston for a reported stabbing Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The woman, who is not named in court filings, is seeking relief from the court for physical, psychological and emotional injuries she said she incurred while seeking treatment for her child in his office in 2023.\nAccording to court documents, the woman was touched inappropriately and in a sexual manner while in the treatment room with Ramirez and her daughter. Following the encounter, which she said she tried to rebuff, the woman notified office staff and subsequently filed a report with the Chestertown Police Department.\nIn September 2023, the woman made a formal complaint to the Maryland State Board of Physicians.\nThrough the course of the board's investigation, four former employees \"all testified to a pervasive environment of sexually abusive, unethical, and inappropriate behavior,\" according to the investigation report.\nThe investigation found Ramirez, on multiple occasions, sexually assaulted at least three female employees of his over the course of several years. The investigation further found that he sexually assaulted at least one other mother while in the course of treating her child.\nFollowing the board's initial inquiry into the allegations in April, the board ordered a summary suspension of Ramirez's license, concluding \"the public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action in this case.\"\nAs a result of the board's investigation, Ramirez permanently surrendered his license to practice medicine, according to a letter Ramirez sent to the board.\nAs listed by the Maryland Board of Physicians, Ramirez, 65, graduated from Universidad de El Salvador Facultad de Medicina in 1988. He was first licensed in Maryland in 1998.\nRamirez opened his first office in Chestertown in 1999. According to information on his practice's website, he opened a second office in Centreville in 2004 to \"better serve the Queen Anne's and neighboring communities.\" In February of 2015, he moved this office to the Shore Medical Pavilion in Queenstown. Hospital affiliations include the Anne Arundel Medical Center and Chester River Hospital Center.\nThe woman, named Jane Doe in the court filings, is represented by Schlachman, Belsky, Weiner & Davey of Baltimore. The complaint was filed by Michael J. Belsky and Catherine A. Dickinson.\nIn a statement released to the press, the law firm attorneys state Ramirez grabbed their client's breasts, vagina and buttocks in the course of examining her daughter. The attorneys state it is likely there are other victims.\n\"As alleged in the Complaint, Dr. Ramirez was a serial abuser of women. Our office is actively investigating these instances of abuse, especially against mothers who were assaulted while the doctor was treating their children. It goes without saying that this behavior is not acceptable, and we intend to hold the doctor accountable for his actions. We encourage anyone with information on these allegations to reach out to us,\" Belsky and Dickinson said in an interview with the Kent County News.\nRamirez's office is not taking phone calls. A message on his website states, \"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my office has closed permanently. Due to unforeseen circumstances, and after careful deliberation, I have decided to retire and close my practice. I assure you that this decision was not made lightly, and I am deeply saddened that I will no longer be able to serve you and our community as a pediatrician.\"\nHe continues, \"I would like to thank you for your time and the trust you have given me during our many years of operation in Chestertown. Taking care of your family was an honor and a privilege for me and my staff. My years here have been filled with countless rewarding experiences and the most remarkable patients. These shared moments will be remembered fondly, and will always be with me.\"\nContacted Tuesday morning, Kent County State's Attorney Brian DiGregroy was not able to immediately respond to inquires regarding any criminal charges. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Crankshaw-Quimby noted that the shelter has yet to reach its busiest time of the year for kitten, which is in the later summer months and early fall.\n\"This is a trend we are seeing across the country,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"I am the president of Professional Animal Workers of Maryland, the state association of shelters and animal control agencies, and we are seeing crisis level intake in our larger municipalities.\"\nA similar trend is being seen in Caroline County.\nKaren Culotta, director of the Caroline County Humane Society, said the number of dogs at the animal shelter has increased significantly over the past four years.\nThe shelter is currently at 95% capacity. Though Culotta said they spend all their efforts caring for all the animals they can, the influx has overwhelmed the shelter.\nCulotta acknowledged that it is difficult to determine the exact reason for the influx. She said it seems to go beyond issues of pets going without being spayed or neutered. She speculates that it could be economically driven.\n\"For some people, with the cost of vet care going up, with the cost of everything going up, or, since the pandemic, sometimes (people) can't afford to feed their animals or can't afford to get vaccinations, which is required of every cat and dog in the state of Maryland,\" Culotta said. \"It's very challenging for everybody here.\"\nCrankshaw-Quimby said that the Talbot County Shelter has embedded essential programs to help address the large number of animals the shelter is facing.\n\"We work very hard to keep animals out of the shelter with our robust assortment of programs; however, being an open admission shelter that turns no county resident in need of surrendering their pet away, as well as performing the role of animal control, one large animal control seizure or a wave of animal surrenders could put us over the top,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"This is why the foster, spay/neuter and intervention programs are so very important.\"\nCulotta said she has contacted directors of other local shelters, and they have noted the \"odd\" rise in intake.\n\"It's definitely a crisis here on the Eastern Shore,\" Culotta said.\nCulotta and Crankshaw-Quimby encouraged residents to partake in spray/neuter programs and to sign-up to take in foster animals, particularly dogs, at a local shelter. Participating in these programs can assist shelters as they go through high animal intake, they said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Organizations on the Shore hosts count of people experiencing homelessness\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 From Queen Anne's County to Dorchester County many churches, libraries and senior centers assisted as various organizations hosted a point-in-time, a count of all experiencing unsheltered and sheltered homelessness.In Caroline County alone, approximately 142 people were reported to be in attendance on Wednesday. Jimmy Morris, continuum of care housing specialist for Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said the count in Dorchester County recorded its highest ever number of people experiencing homelessness. Finalized numbers for the Mid-Shore will not be available for several weeks.\nMorris said large efforts were made to reach this specific population, from media outreach to visiting encampments. He said this larger effort was made due to the growing population of homelessness on the Shore.\nOver the last few years, the population of people experiencing homelessness has skyrocketed on the Eastern Shore, and organizations focused on assisting this population are working to have a proper count in order to better secure funds to provide resources.\nAshley Kessinger, continuum care manager at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said this winter the organization's shelters were filled with people trying to stay warm.\n\"It's been a crisis,\" Kessinger said. \"Our shelters are completely full, and they stay full all the time. They're all working off of waitlists. They're all trying to find other ways so that people that come to them, don't have to turn them away. But they're just full and we don't have enough.\"\nAccording to Kessinger, the results of the data gathered by each jurisdiction will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and can be used to secure grant funding.\nYvette Robinson, grant manager at Neighborhood Service Center, was distributing information at the Fredrick Douglas room of the Talbot County Free Library in Easton, one of the locations for the county Wednesday. Robinson said homelessness on the Eastern Shore looks different in comparison to homelessness in major cities. One of those contributing factors, she said, is resources.\n\"The numbers are growing, the resources are not,\" Robinson said. \"We rely on community partners to try to collaborate so that we can see what's working, what may not be working \u2026we're just trying to get the information out that there are variable resources.\"\nAccording to Robinson, since Nov. 24, 2024, Neighborhood Service Center has given out 9,000 pounds of food and served over 600 families, a majority of which were homeless.\nKessinger said a contributing factor to the growing homeless population has been a lack of affordable housing on the shore. Many of the people served at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health either have no income or they receive funds from Social Security which can be about $900 a month.\nA lack of affordable housing has made the issue worse but it is the mark of homelessness that will make it difficult to get landlords to consider working on affordable housing alternatives.\nIn her experience, there are some landlords that refuse to help customers that her organization works with because the customers have experienced homelessness. Kessinger said there is an assumption that the customers will be bad tenants or bad people in general.\nFor Kessinger, everyone deserves help and people shouldn't treat those experiencing homelessness differently because of their circumstance because it can happen to anyone at any time.\n\"People think homelessness looks a certain way and we have seen people from all walks of life and it does not look a certain way,\" Kessinger said. \"There's a lot of stigma on the shore about homelessness and some people just don't want to see it. If they come across an encampment or something like that, they just want it to go away. \u2026everyone deserves a chance to have a home.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year's training brought Talbot and Caroline sheriff's deputies, Easton police, local EMTs and paramedics, and others to The Country School.\nCaroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull led a drill Thursday afternoon, showing me just how critical it is that first responders from different counties to work together cohesively under stress.\nAnd the results were enlightening: officers and EMTs didn't always make the correct decision every split-second, but they did confer with each other on what steps to take during the next drill, learning how to get better along the way.\nTo learn more about the training, read my story below.

So you've got to get them and educate them.\" He said he understood both his children's, Lajan and Sputty, and Mayor Stephen Rideout's points of view regarding the juvenile curfew but said the council shouldn't be \"at each other's throats\" and \"controlled by 25 kids.\" \"We've all got to come together,\" he said.In late August, Rideout vetoed a juvenile curfew ordinance which commissioners had passed Aug. 14.Before that, in July, Rideout had proposed an alternative curfew ordinance which had additions and changes from the original curfew ordinance. These included adding definitions and altering language on enforcement procedures and penalties.Since Rideout vetoed the original curfew ordinance, Sputty Cephas has made amendments to Rideout's alternative ordinance in an effort to compromise and \"find middle ground.\" According to council meeting documents, Cephas plans to recommend these amendments Sept. 25 when Rideout's proposed ordinance will be read for a second time.During the meeting, Sputty Cephas talked about finding that middle ground.\"Commissioner Atkiss made a point to say that $100 is a lot of money for a struggling parent,\" he said.\"My day job is in banking, so I understand that struggle as well.\" Sputty Cephas said he would like to keep fines as part of the penalty for not following the curfew, but said he cut them in half in his amendment. Instead of a $100 fine, it would be $50.At the end of the meeting, Rideout suggested to Sputty Cephas that the two of them get together to talk about the proposed amendments to the alternative ordinance. Sputty Cephas agreed to meet.Two presentations were given during Monday's meeting, as well. One presentation was given by Pam Gregory, president and CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, and one by Lisa Molock, chief executive director at Let's Thrive Baltimore and an organizer for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.Molock talked about the work she has been doing in Baltimore, and Gregory talked about the economic issues that many Marylanders face. She shared data from a report that focused on asset limited, income constrained and employed (or ALICE) Marylanders and shared data on Dorchester County residents specifically. Gregory said that in Dorchester County, 45% of residents are below the ALICE threshold.During public comment, Theresa Stafford said poverty is a \"lead driver\" for many other issues in Cambridge.\"We need to get serious about fixing the problem of poverty,\" Stafford said.\"Bringing in industries or businesses that will pay good wages, and of course, supporting getting kids educated because that's the other key driver that keeps driving up the crime.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nPam Gregory, CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, gives a presentation at a Cambridge City Council meeting on Sept. 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 Firefighters across the Mid-Shore worked together to put out a large town house fire in St. Michaels on Saturday. No injuries were reported.Around 1:20 p.m. Saturday, the St. Michaels Fire Department responded to a fire at a six-unit town house complex on Martingham Circle. Assistant Chief Phil Jones said a second alarm was requested. Agencies from Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties assisted, with at least 70 people on the scene.\nThe fire was caused by an electrical failure with an HVAC system in the attic, according to the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nJones said two of the six units will be \"displaced for some time.\" A third unit incurred small fire damage, a fourth unit sustained water damage and the other two units were unharmed, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office estimates $1 million in damages to the structure and contents.\nFirst responders were able to extinguish most of the fire in the first hour of efforts. Jones said firefighters were on scene for over four hours Saturday to fully handle the blaze. They had to be mindful of the hot conditions.\n\"With the heat, it makes it twice as hard for us,\" Jones said. \"Usually a firefighter can only work five to 15 minutes in the heat\" without taking a break, he added.\nAll firefighters were required to receive a medical check on their vitals, Jones said. Crews went through over 20 cases of bottled waters.\nJones emphasized that the firefighters on scene were all volunteers. He expressed appreciation for the responding units from surrounding counties, as the additional manpower was necessary for such a hot day. Jones said there was good cooperation with the homeowners and between fire agencies.\n\"We all work together to complete everything,\" Jones said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students and staff were evacuated into the stadium and are safe, police say.\nPolice say students who are car riders are being picked up at the Easton Elks Lodge, students who are bus riders are riding buses and students who are walkers can walk home.\nAs of 3:01 p.m., \"all buses (were) being loaded and released from EHS,\" according to police. All after-school activities are canceled.\nTalbot County Public Schools sent EHS families a message at around 2:15 p.m. on Monday.\n\"Easton High has received a Bomb threat. At this time the school is on lockdown,\" the message stated. \"We are waiting further direction from law enforcement.\"\n\"This is an ongoing investigation and Deputies will be on scene for several hours,\" Talbot County Sheriff's Office stated. \"Please avoid the area and obey police detours. We will be sure to release additional information as soon as it becomes available.\"\nEarlier on Monday, the Talbot County Sheriff's Office said it was investigating a threat made on social media.\nSheriff Joe Gamble said Monday morning that the threat, which originated on Instagram, was not a specific threat to Talbot County Public Schools, but to the 410 area code. It was not immediately shared by law enforcement if the Easton High lockdown resulted from this threat or from a separate threat.\nOn Monday morning, Gamble said all school resource officers in the district were aware of the threat, and extra deputies were patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nThis report will be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry, 27, guilty of two drug charges, handing down two 15-year sentences and suspending all but five years of each in a binding agreement. The two fiveyear terms will be served concurrently, according to court documents.Henry's release will be followed by three years of supervised probation.The charges against Henry stemmed from the Easton Police Department's investigation into a fatal overdose late last year.Police were dispatched to the Econo Lodge on Dec. 5, 2022, for an overdose victim.Officers began and continued resuscitation efforts until they were relieved by Talbot County paramedics.The victim was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was later pronounced dead.Detectives with EPD's Criminal Investigations Division conducted the death investigation. After several months, Henry and Iyana Wilson, 27, were identified as the individuals who sold a cocaine and fentanyl mix to the victim, police said.Two cases involving alleged drug possession and distribution remain pending against Wilson.In September, Wilson entered an Alford plea to possession with intent to distribute narcotics in one case. She is set to be sentenced Dec. 15 in Talbot County Circuit Court.A second case charges Wilson with manufacturing narcotics, conspiring with Henry to manufacture drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia and obstructing justice.She is also alleged to have altered physical evidence relevant to a criminal proceeding and to have possessed contraband in a place of confinement by having narcotics inside her body while at the Easton Police Department, according to charging documents.The second case against Wilson is set for a status conference on Dec. 1. \n \n Caption: The Talbot County Circuit Court is located at 11 North Washington St., Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those boxes do not get prettier with time and will continue to mar our beautiful highways until they are removed.\nIf we get them out of the ground, can someone collect them and dispose of them in a responsible way?

    "content": "Crime in Cambridge 'trending down,' police department says\n\n April 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 521\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 The number of reported crimes, ShotSpotter alerts and shots fired calls is down in the first quarter of this year compared to last year in Cambridge, according to a quarterly report from the Cambridge Police Department.Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said he thinks this shows that crime in Cambridge is \"trending down.\"\n\"A lot of credit goes to our officers that are out doing what we're asking of them to do as an administration,\" he said about these decreases. \"And that's patrol with a purpose, be in our high-crime areas.\"\nTodd also attributes the lowering of these stats to the department's work in getting guns off the street. He said that last year the department averaged getting one illegal firearm off the street per week in Cambridge alone.\n\"We know there's more out there, and we know there's still crime,\" Todd said. \"But we're making progress.\"\nAccording to the CPD report, in the first quarter of 2024, CPD submitted 200 crime incidents committed within its jurisdiction to the National Incident-Based Reporting System, a national reporting system for crimes used by police departments. That is compared to 247 incidents submitted in the first quarter of 2023.\nThis year, the majority of those incidents have been assaults.\nThe CPD report also states there was a 33.3% decrease in ShotSpotter alerts for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system that has sensors that can detect and locate illegal gunfire incidents and alert law enforcement.\nThe CPD report states there was a 40.9% decrease in shots fire calls compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nThe first quarter of this year, there were 46 Shot Spotter alerts and 13 shots fired calls in Cambridge, according to the report. There was one shooting in that time.\nTodd confirmed that shooting was on March 1 in the 800 block of Phillips Street. According to previous Dorchester Star reporting, police found several spent shell casings from multiple calibers of handguns on the scene. Isaiah David Foster, 23, of Cambridge was arrested on firearm possession charges, as well as resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering, following the incident.\nAccording to the CPD report, calls for service increased 9.1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Todd said this is a good thing because it shows that officers are out in the community doing their jobs.\nCompared to 171 adult arrests, there were eight juvenile arrests and 34 juvenile referrals in the first quarter of 2024.\nAlthough Todd said he didn't have those numbers for this time last year, when it comes to juvenile crime, he thinks Cambridge is \"stagnant.\"\n\"I think there's a lot of work to do with juvenile reform,\" he said. \"We have to put more emphasis on figuring out why these kids are out committing these crimes and getting in touch with families by working through social services and Juvenile Services.\"\nTodd said that the department will have a better understanding of the state of crime in Cambridge come summer.\n\"When the kids get out of school, that'll be a big factor of just how good we're doing crime-wise,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Young is charged with first-degree assault, home invasion, reckless endangerment and four firearm charges.\nAdkins faces two handgun charges, accessory after the fact to a felony, altering physical evidence and making a false statement to an officer.\nAround 1:40 p.m. on Aug. 12, police were dispatched to a first-floor room in the hotel.

Terrell grabbed Adkins and left the room before \"Young grabbed Adkins and took her back\" into the room, per court records.\nA woman in a room on the second floor later told police that Adkins \"knocked on her door and handed her a handgun.\" Adkins allegedly told the woman, \"'Take this 'cause I don't want to get in trouble,'\" court records indicate.\nAn officer saw Adkins on the second floor and approached her. Adkins told officers \"there was no gun\" and soon after \"doubled down\" on that assertion, court records state.\nOfficers found a gun in the second-floor room, which was allegedly the same one hidden by Adkins and held by Young during the incident on the first floor.\nAdkins was released on $25,000 unsecured personal bond on Aug. 14. A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 2.\nYoung posted $1,000 cash bond on Aug. 3.

    "content": "Easton's new fire chief has plans for equipment, recruitment\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 J.R. Dobson grew up around the fire house, always knowing he wanted to be a firefighter.In his teenage years, Dobson joined the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company as a junior cadet, and by 16 he began riding the fire trucks. He fondly recalls the \"everybody knew everybody\" aspect of the tight-knit community.\nDobson eventually moved to Easton, beginning his journey with the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in 2003. Over time, he's served in a number of roles, including most recently, assistant chief.\nNow he's taking on the department's top role for the first time. Dobson was elected the department's chief in December.\nWith a wife and two daughters, timing was everything for Dobson when considering the commitment to assume a role as demanding as Easton fire chief. The timing is right, he said, and he's looking forward to leading and making a difference.\n\"There's a lot of tradition here,\" Dobson said. \"It's certainly the biggest department in the county. It's got probably the most going on out of all the departments in the county. I think just being here, seeing how this department operates versus a small department. It's a business. And we're all here for free, none of us get paid.\"\nDobson officially began as chief this month. Sonny Jones just wrapped up his third two-year term leading the department.\nDobson, who volunteers at the fire department as all the firefighters do, is a patrol and operations commander at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. He believes his experience leading around 35 deputies across multiple divisions will translate to his duties in the fire house.\n\"I think that I bring a lot of management skills, leadership skills,\" Dobson said. \"Just from my experience there, I think it helps you here.\"\nThus far, Dobson says the support he's received has been \"overwhelming.\"\nPast fire chiefs have reached out, and he hopes to pick up one thing from each of them to set himself up for success. For instance, Jones' ability as an incident commander is something Dobson admires.\n\"If there were ever a bad day anybody was having, he's who you would want there,\" Dobson said of Jones. \"Just the way he kind of rolls through an incident scene. He's been there and done that kind of thing.\"\nSimilarly, Jones \u2014 who is remaining involved with the department \u2014 spoke highly of Dobson.\n\"I've known J.R. the entire time that I've been a member of the Easton fire department,\" Jones said. \"J.R. is a first-rate guy. He's a terrific leader. He has many, many qualities which will bode well for him as the chief of the department.\"\nSome of the ongoing projects the new fire chief has his eye on include purchasing a utility vehicle to use for Rails to Trails and woods fires, buying a new engine and updating box alarm assignments. He also wants to implement some new standard operating procedures.\nDobson said he hopes to nail down a handful of tasks for the year and keep circling back to see what progress is being made. At the top of his list is recruitment and retention of volunteers.\n\"I think it all starts with recruiting. I think it all starts with retention,\" Dobson said. \"Those are things that we've done well in the past, although the last year or so we haven't gotten as many members as we would like. And sometimes we'll get members in and they don't realize the commitment.\"\nWhile acknowledging the town's consistent support of the department over the years, Dobson believes Easton Fire can do better in attracting more volunteers amid struggles statewide and nationwide to fill volunteer fire departments.\n\"We got to get people in here,\" Dobson said. \"We've got to get these trucks out.

    "content": "Talbot, Queen Anne's counties included on Trump's list of 'sanctuary jurisdictions'\n\n May 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot and Queen Anne's counties have been listed as \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" by the Trump administration, a label disputed by officials from both counties.President Donald Trump issued an executive order last month instructing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to track the jurisdictions the administration considers to be defying the president's immigration crackdown efforts.\nOn Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 jurisdictions across the country, stating that those jurisdictions are \"defying federal immigration law.\"\nQueen Anne's and Talbot officials challenged the claim Friday. In a statement, Queen Anne's County called the sanctuary designation \"wholly inaccurate.\"\n\"Queen Anne's County has never adopted or endorsed sanctuary policies, nor have we enacted any ordinances or resolutions that would shield individuals in violation of federal immigration law,\" the statement read.\nTalbot County said it received no communication from the federal government that it wasn't complying with federal immigration laws in advance of the list being published.\n\"We have, and will continue to, follow all applicable federal laws and have not taken any deliberate actions to obstruct their enforcement,\" a statement from a Talbot County spokesperson read.\n\"We welcome further information and guidance from the federal government so we can address any pertinent issues,\" the statement added.\nThe DHS website states that jurisdictions were designated \"sanctuary\" based on the following factors: \"compliance with federal law enforcement, information restrictions, and legal protections for illegal aliens.\"\nNoem said in a DHS press release about the list of jurisdictions that the department is \"exposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.\"\n\"These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem said.\nAs part of Trump's effort to label \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" federal agencies are directed to identify federal grants and contracts for potential \"suspension or termination, as appropriate,\" per the president's executive order.\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview Friday he's concerned for the status of a federal grant that goes to the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. This year, the agency received $40,000 to increase patrol efforts in Trappe, a town without its own police department.\nThe grant \u2014 which is administered annually \u2014 has led to a number of arrests and reduced crime, Gamble said.\n\"We hope that we can reapply and renew that grant,\" he said.\nTalbot County's inclusion on the list was a \"total shock\" to Gamble, who says his office has always complied with immigration agents. \"They haven't asked us to do anything,\" he said. \"We haven't said no to anything.\"\nGamble said he's spoken with the former and current Maryland ICE directors, both of whom indicated they are unsure of why Talbot County is listed.\nQueen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann expressed similar sentiments. He said Friday he's not aware of any actions by his office or the county government that could lead to the sanctuary designation.\n\"This is continued misinformation that's been perpetuated now,\" Hofmann said. \"I've heard this for a couple years, so it's of no surprise.\"\nUnder Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has ramped up agreements with local law enforcement agencies, referred to as 287(g) agreements, to carry out immigration crackdown efforts. ICE has signed nearly 700 of these agreements nationwide and seven in Maryland.\nNeither Talbot County nor Queen Anne's County are currently engaged in 287(g) agreements. Hofmann and Gamble said since the sheriff's offices aren't in charge of the counties' jails, they can't enter into jail enforcement agreements with ICE like other Maryland counties have.\nHofmann noted the Queen Anne's sheriff's office was eligible for ICE's Secure Communities program, a separate and now defunct effort where local agencies submitted fingerprints of those arrested to the federal government. Fingerprints were cross-checked with immigration databases.\nHofmann added that since it ended, his office \"hasn't changed on how we deal with criminals,\" emphasizing a \"zero tolerance\" approach.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As Marylanders escape winter weather, hopefully, there's a pause in the storm seasons.\nJune is considered the beginning of hurricane season and Johnson mentioned some things to stay alert to on the Eastern Shore.\nAt the Kent County Public Library on March 21, she introduced her audience to their program: SKYWARN.\nShe's looking for more and more people to become a spotter, who look out for the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure and severe weather features, then report the information accurately.\n\"The main mission of the spotter is to be aware of the rapidly changing conditions of the weather,\" Johnson replied.\nAnd it's sorely needed too.\nJohnson said last year they reported the second most severe thunderstorms.\nThe third most for tornado warnings.\nAnd the fourth most in flash flood warnings.\nUnperturbed by the smaller audience in attendance, she was concise and enthusiastic while walking through the process of what to look out for.\nFor instance, people tend to be on high alert when they get something on their phone saying \"tornado warning.\" Not so much when they get a \"severe thunderstorm warning.\"\n\"That's a mistake to think one's worse than the other,\" Johnson commented.\nEspecially when water can be more harmful than wind in most cases, she said.\n\"When we look at the fatalities, 75% in the United States are due to water in some way; 50% of those are those are due to storm surge; 25% freshwater heavy rain flooding. Keep that in mind. Don't think, 'Oh, it's just a tropical storm.' No, you still need to pay attention and see what the hazards are.\"\nSevere storms should not be treated much differently than a tornado.\nShe then pointed out the difference between a storm watch and a storm warning. A watch means to keep an eye on the weather pattern.\nA warning means, don't just watch \u2014 get prepared.\nA severe storm warning means, gather up some candles for light, or buy extra gas for the back-up generator and do things that will prepare your family and yourself for a potential hazard.\nAs hurricanes emerge from the North Atlantic ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Johnson reminded her audience how to categorize them and what that exactly means.\nHurricanes, big or small, she indicated, can create problems, such as tornados.\nThe uninformed, she added, might hear about a category 1 hurricane and think it's not much of a problem. They'll see it as a little rain and wind. Very minimal damage.\nThe savvy spotter though, will see that even a category 1 hurricane can create big problems, such as a tornado. The spotter will know category 1, simply describes the wind of the hurricane. Nothing else. It does not highlight the possibility of it creating tornados or other adverse weather conditions.\nAnd those who think tornados are only a threat in Kansas are in for a rude awakening.\nTornados hit everywhere, Johnson pointed out. Even in our backyard.\nShe said Hurricane Ida was a remnant tropical system that produced a lot of tornados in 2020.\nHurricane Isaias was a destructive Category 1 hurricane, producing the longest tracked tornado in Delaware history.\nTornados in Cecil County and Southern Delaware \u2014 resulted in fatalities last year.\n\"That's why we need you all,\" she said, encouraging her audience to report their observations to their nearest national weather station.\nTo become a spotter, adults are invited to complete the SKYWARN training.\nThose who finish the course join a volunteer program with between 350,000 and 400,000 trained severe weather spotters.\nIndividuals affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches and nursing homes or who have a responsibility for protecting others are encouraged to become a spotter.\n\"There can be no finer reward than to know that your efforts have given your family and neighbors the precious gift of time\u2014minutes that can help save lives,\" as stated by the NWS.\nAnd as the movie \"Twisters,\" the sequel to the original from 1996, comes out in theaters shortly, Johnson jokes that she's preparing to field a lot more questions about tornados.\nShe discouraged the crowd on becoming storm chasers like sensationalist Hollywood actors and actresses, but rather to become informed citizens who save lives. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Anton Black's family settles with state medical examiner\n\n November 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 773\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - A $235,000 settlement approved by the Board of Public Works resolved all claims in a federal lawsuit brought against the state medical examiner by the family of 19-year-old Anton Black, who died in Greensboro in 2018 after being restrained by police.The settlement, which includes a $100,000 payment to Black's family and $135,000 toward attorneys' fees, was approved without discussion during Wednesday's Board of Public Works meeting.The settlement also \"makes necessary changes to the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's process for autopsies conducted on people killed in law enforcement custody and requires notification to families about the results and their rights to challenge the results,\" according to a news release from the American Civil Liberties Union.Reforms to the state medical examiner's office include the adoption of a policy addressing how medical examiners handle deaths in custody, which includes those involving law enforcement restraint, according to the ACLU.The policy also incorporates and models guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners for determining how such deaths are investigated and how examiners determine causation.The ACLU said the reforms will instill more transparency, impartiality and \"independence from improper law enforcement influence.\" The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner must also provide families with information on their rights to seek correction of an autopsy report and the procedures to seek that correction.In a statement, Richard Potter, the founder of the Coalition for Justice for Anton Black, called the settlement an \"excellent first step,\" adding that community members must stay vigilant to ensure it's effective and increases accountability from within.\"I hope that with this settlement agencies will begin to recognize their own wrongdoings, catch them and change them before they cause harm,\" he said in the statement. \"What is needed is a sense of shared ownership that can only come through trust and mutual accountability, with police confronting their own biases about mental illness, committing to de-escalation, and truly serving a diverse community.\" Black died on his mother's front steps on Sept. 15, 2018, after being chased, tased and restrained by three white police officers and a white civilian.That day, Black and a 12-year-old family friend were walking around Greensboro together when Black began pulling and dragging the child, who was calling out for help, garnering attention from onlookers that led to a call to police.The chase ended outside Black's home, where Greensboro Police Officer Thomas Webster IV, offduty Ridgely Police Chief Gary Manos, Centreville Police Officer Dennis Lannon and a civilian attempted to restrain Black, pressing his body against a wooden handicap ramp for six minutes while attempting to handcuff and shackle him.Black later became unresponsive, but continued breathing and had a pulse.Officers rolled Black on his side, then shifted him to a sitting position.After no further response, officers removed the handcuffs and began CPR. Black was later transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton, where he was pronounced dead that evening.The medical examiner ruled that Black's death was an accident caused by a heart condition, with bipolar disorder as a contributing cause.Unanswered questions surrounding Black's death and excessive use of force spurred the litigation. The family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against multiple police officers, towns and the state medical examiner involved in the case in December 2020.No one was charged in connection to Black's death.In August 2022, the family and coalition reached a settlement that required police departments in Greensboro, Ridgely and Centreville to overhaul use of force policies and the enhancement of resources for police confronting mental health emergencies; officer training in de-escalation, intervention and implicit bias; hiring transparency; and public complaint reporting.The settlement also included a $5 million payment to Black's family from the police and municipal defendants.Black's death caused his family and the coalition to become deeply involved in Maryland's campaign for police reform and accountability.Efforts by the family and the Coalition led to the passage of Anton's Law in 2021, which makes police discipline records available to the community under Maryland's Public Information Act.Sonia Kumar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland, said the \"hardfought\" settlement is about ensuring the medical examiner is truthful about what happens when people, particularly Black people, are killed by police or corrections officials.\"We can't prevent such deaths if we aren't honest about what caused them, and this settlement is a crucial step towards that goal in future cases,\" she said in a statement. \"We hope this settlement will make a real, positive impact, but it is truly just the beginning of the reckoning needed to address decades of misrepresentations so we can bring justice to families still waiting for the government to tell the truth.\" \n \n Caption: ANTON BLACK \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All decisions and disagreement must go through Queen Anne's County Commissioners, and if they may have a disagreement it will be mediated.\nThe Caroline County commissioners expressed concerns about the autonomy and authority of the the new facility's warden. According to the draft agreement, \"The Board shall appoint a Warden to operate the Facility with the consent of the County Commissioners of Queen Anne's County.\"\nThe draft agreement also stated that \"The Warden's contract shall not be terminated without the Board's consent\"\nThe commissioners voiced that they believed under the draft that Queens Anne's county could decide after a certain amount of time to remove Caroline or Kent county from agreement, regardless of the amount of money that was put up. To remove one or both of the other counties from the agreement, according to the draft, Queen Anne's County must give the other county a two-year notice to take its prisoners and house them elsewhere.\nThe commissioners said they understood Queen Anne's County's decision to conduct the draft agreement this way, but they requested further negotiation and discussion to establish a partnering jurisdiction.\nLast week, the commissioners made clear that while Caroline County has not completely abandoned the idea of a regional detention center, the commissioners are leaning toward not participating in the agreement and focusing on upgrades toward the facility within county limits. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\" the statement said. \"Deputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff's deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The intention is to allow inspectors onto property the town deems pose a public safety risk.\nThe now more permanent administrative search warrant ordinance is related to the emergency version issued earlier this year.\nThe ordinance's initial draft received considerable public outcry but no public comment was presented at the hearing.\n\"So that feels like a good sign,\" Council President Ashley Kaiser said.\nThe council has made significant progress in ordinance developments to make it more palatable but public education will be needed before initiating any type of robust enforcement, she said.\n\"I think it is a step in the right direction and puts us in line with a lot of towns around us,\" Kaiser said.\nIn other business, three applications have been received for the two chairs open in the council's upcoming October election.\nThe Ethics Board will review applications before considerations are brought to the Board of Supervisors of Elections.\nAlthough currently on the ballot for re-election, Council Member Jim Beauchamp noted he intended to withdraw if both other candidates move forward.\nBeauchamp has served off and on the council for 10 years, \"It's been a good 10 years,\" he said.\nThe Centreville Town Council will next meet Sept. 4 at 7 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of the county's schools will be operating on a two-hour delay schedule Wednesday, Jan. 10, for evaluation of overnight flooding and storm damage, according to the school system.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools were also dismissed early Tuesday due to the storm. As of Tuesday afternoon, all of the county's schools are set to run on a 90-minute delayed opening Wednesday, with reevaluation and modifications possible in the morning.\nSchools in Talbot and Caroline counties canceled all after-school activities Tuesday. Both districts are monitoring conditions to determine if delays or closures will be necessary Wednesday.\nThe Caroline County Board of Education meeting will be held as scheduled at 6 p.m. Tuesday.\nGov. Wes Moore enacted a State of Preparedness declaration Tuesday morning, directing the state's department of emergency management to coordinate responses to the storm's impacts.\nRainfall of 1 to 3 inches is possible across the region Tuesday, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night before tapering off Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe main concern is the potential for coastal flooding in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, said Mike Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Philadelphia/Mount Holly office. Dorchester County is also expected to experience significant flooding.\nA coastal flood warning is in effect from 7 p.m. Tuesday to 7 p.m. Wednesday for areas along the lower Chesapeake Bay, including Cambridge, which will see major impact from flooding early Wednesday morning, according to the Weather Service. Water is expected be two to three feet above ground level in some low-lying areas.\nA coastal flood warning and a flood watch are in effect for Talbot, Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent counties from Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.\nModerate coastal flooding is possible Tuesday with the high tide cycle. Water levels are expected to continue rising Tuesday night from strong southerly winds. The rising water levels could lead to potentially significant flooding.\nThe highest tides will be early Wednesday morning and again in the afternoon.\nWidespread roadway flooding is expected across the region's bayside communities and along tidal waterways. Dorchester County could see road closures.\nStrong, gusty winds are also expected to build across the region throughout the day Tuesday.\nDorchester County is under a high wind warning from 4 p.m. Tuesday to 4 a.m. Wednesday, with south to southeast winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph possible. Fallen trees, downed power lines and widespread power outages are expected.\nTalbot, Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne's counties are under a wind advisory from 5 p.m. Tuesday to 3 a.m. Wednesday. Sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph are expected, with gusts up to 55 mph.\nThe already-saturated ground in the region has also made trees more vulnerable to becoming uprooted with strong winds.\nThe Talbot County Department of Emergency Services urged residents to make sure loose items are secured ahead of time and reminded residents to not drive through or stand in flooded roadways.\nThe region will dry out some on Thursday, but a second storm is likely to roll through the region again Friday night into Saturday, the Weather Service said.\nThis story has been updated to include information on school delays and closures.

If the Charging Committee decides to administratively charge, they use the statewide police disciplinary matrix to \"decide what kind of discipline would be necessary based on the complaint.\"\nThe five members of the Charging Committee were appointed and trained in April 2023 at the Fretterd Center by the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission.\nThe third board is the Trial Board comprised of retired Maryland Circuit Court Judge Owen Wise, a citizen and a police officer of the same rank, Raeder said. No complaints have been referred to this board.\n\"I'm proud to say that Caroline County is leading the way for other counties on the Eastern Shore who have reached out to us regarding using Judge Wise, if they need a judge for a trial board,\" she said.\nFew complaints filed\nAmong the county's municipalities, 15 complaints were filed, including a pending complaint related to an April 7, 2023, incident in Denton that prompted millions of views on YouTube, Bartlett said.\nA video of the incident shows Christopher Morgan threatening the residents and breaking the window of the storm door of a home while two Denton Police officers stand on the sidewalk watching.\nThe way the officers handled the call for service prompted Denton Police Chief George Bacorn to request the Talbot County Sheriff's Office to investigate the handling of the incident. Their findings were turned over to the Administrative Charging Committee.\nThere were no complaints from Ridgely or Greensboro. One was brought to the Police Accountability Board from Federalsburg, which was exonerated, Bartlett said.\nThe report breaks down the 15 complaints by percentages; numerically, four complaints are pending investigation, three were administratively charged, two were withdrawn by the complainant, four were exonerated and two were \"not in the purview of the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee).\"\nThe Accountability Board identified trends in the disciplinary process and didn't \"recommend any changes at this time.\"\n\"A common identified trend, however, has been the lack of activation of body cameras when officers interact with the public,\" the report stated. \"The ACC discovered this trend when reviewing completed complaint investigations which had no body camera footage for the ACC to review. The Board advised the municipal Police Departments and the Sheriff's Office to remind Officers to adhere to department policy and activate their cameras when encountering the public. The policy protects both the Officer and the Citizen if a complaint were to arise from the interaction.\"\nCost to the county\nBartlett thanked the commissioners for their \"financial support of the committee for legal decisions when needed.\"\nThe boards' complying with the state mandates has incurred expenses for the county, although some have been covered by the Police Accountability, Community, and Transparency Grant program.\nOf the $105,272 in grant funds received, the Accountability Board has spent $49,545, which includes the purchase of IAPro software for filing complaints, annual computer licensing for all board members, and pay for the Board's administrator.\nThe Police Accountability Board is asking the state to continue offering these grants, as well as other police-oriented grant programs for local police departments to be able to purchase \"the required technology, resources, and tools to comply with the law,\" including software and a change in the vendor for body cameras, so that every law enforcement agency in the county has the same system.\nOther costs included outside legal counsel, with expenses the County Commissioners agreed to fund to the tune of nearly $8,000.\nQuestions arose requiring legal clarification for both the Police Accountability Board and Administrative Charging Committee, and the county commissioners \"agreed to bear the expense of hiring outside legal counsel\" to represent both. \"Legal Counsel attends each quarterly meeting and provides interpretation of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021 as needed,\" the report stated.\nThe legal expenses for the Police Accountability Board were $3,650, while those of the Administrative Charging Committee amounted to $4,300.\nPAB recommendations\nThe Accountability Board recommends \"changing ACC training from all in-person training to online meeting based or pre-recorded online training. With one member of our ACC board resigning this past July, we have firsthand knowledge of the burden imposed on the newly appointed volunteer Board member. As terms end or resignations occur, the pool of applicants will continue to shrink when advised that members must undergo uncompensated training prior to serving.\"\nAnother unanticipated result of the law has been the withdrawing of multiple complaints, which created a legal conundrum for the Accountability Board and is currently being resolved with the Office of the Attorney General.\nThe report also suggested amending the law by mandating only complaints of \"matters of public concern,\" that is, \"police misconduct, such as abuse of power, false arrest, police brutality, or criminal activity\" be referred to the Charging Committee, thus alleviating pressure on municipal police departments. \"Rude and discourteous\" behavior towards a citizen would be handled at the department or agency level, as suggested by the Accountability Board.\nTo read the full report, which includes rosters of members of the PAB and ACC boards, visit carolinemd.org/DocumentCenter/View/8606/2023-Annual-Report-PAB?bidId=.

She said a retired volunteer, Sally, was at the doctor's office recently when she discovered her nurse was a child whose case she was appointed to a decade ago.\nDavenport said Sally had never known if she had made a difference in the child's life. At the doctor's office that day, the now-nurse told Sally she got through high school and college because of what Sally said to her.\n\"And so we're here tonight because everyone in this room talks the talk and walks the walk,\" Davenport said. \"And that is really important to us, but certainly to the future of the kids who we're working with.\"\nVolunteer Geoff Searle said he got involved with CASA of the Mid-Shore in 2022 after retiring. He said social workers often have large caseloads, and CASA volunteers are able to focus solely on one child.\nLarry Neviaser, who became a volunteer this year, said one of the things that drew him to the organization is its focus on finding the best outcome for every child.\n\"We don't represent anybody else except the child,\" he said.\nNeviaser said he feels supported by CASA of the Mid-Shore's staff.\n\"They recognize the value of the volunteers, and (that) it really makes the organization,\" he said.\nAlong with being thanked and served up food and drink, CASA volunteers heard a presentation from author and speaker Frank Kros about making positive impacts on children that can last generations.\nWeaving in stories about his own childhood, Kros talked about the mindset of children who have been through abuse and gave tips on how to encourage children.\n\"It's incredible what we can do when someone genuinely believes in us and provides us the support that we need,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As site work begins and the station's main structure is erected, officials placed shovels in the dirt for a ceremonial groundbreaking.\nResidents in Cordova and across northern Talbot County will reap the benefits of the station once it's completed, said Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services.\n\"We always try to make sure that we are to our calls within eight minutes, at least 95% of the time,\" LeCates said. \"And this is an area that was underserved by that.\n\"The (Talbot County Council), they really took note of that. We gave them information. We gave them data.\"\nCouncil members fully funded the $2.1 million project, which will be the county's sixth paramedic station. It will include space for a 24/7 paramedic and EMT unit.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan said the project comes at an important time as renovations are progressing at the elementary school across the street.\n\"It's kind of the perfect storm here when it comes to having safety, kids,\" Callahan said. \"It makes the whole community feel a little bit safer.\"\nJimmy Eason, president of the Talbot County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association, said the station is welcomed \"with open arms.\"\n\"Unfortunately for us in Cordova, we're facing almost a 100% failure to respond rate,\" Eason said. \"But not to any fault of anybody's, it's just a sign of the times. So this station means so much more to this area than some people might believe.\"\nCallahan thanked the Gannon family for giving a piece of their farmland up for the project. Siblings Greg and Celeste Gannon attended Monday's groundbreaking.\nLeCates shouted out their mother, Sylvia Gannon, for her continued loyalty to Talbot County's EMS efforts. Gannon, a former County Council member, was a founding member of the Talbot Paramedic Foundation.\n\"Every step of the way, she always stepped up and tried to help us,\" LeCates said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Whether you're a boater, angler or water sports enthusiast on the Eastern Shore, please remember to be responsible around the water. May 17-23 is National Safe Boating Week. The Safe Boating Campaign, led by the National Safe Boating Council, offers these tips for practicing social distancing and safety while boating:Wear a life jacket. No matter what activity you have planned on the water, always remember to wear a life jacket every time you are on the water. Accidents on the water can happen much too fast to reach and put on a stowed life jacket.Make sure your life jacket is U.S. Coast Guard approved, appropriate for your water activity and fits properly. A life jacket that is too large or too small can cause different situational problems.Know state boating laws. Rules and laws can differ from state to state and violations can result in ticketing, fines or jail time.Take a boating safety course.Learn valuable tips that can help save your life in unexpected situations.Make sure your boat is prepared. There are many items that need to be checked and rechecked on any boat. Schedule a vessel safety check with your local U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary or U.S. Power Squadrons before you hit the water. Every vessel safety check is conducted at no charge.Always file a float plan. File a float plan before you leave shore with someone you trust that includes details about the trip, boat, persons, towing or trailer vehicle, communication equipment, and emergency contacts.Check the weather, including the water temperature. Know the latest marine weather forecast prior to going out, and keep a regular check for changing conditions.Don't drink while you boat. Where the primary cause was known, alcohol was listed as a leading factor in boating-related deaths.Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning. Gasoline-powered engines on boats, including onboard generators, produce carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless and odorless gas that can poison or kill someone who breathes too much of it. Be sure to install and maintain a working CO detector, never block exhaust outlets, and always dock, beach or anchor at least 20 feet away from the nearest boat that is running a generator or engine.Keep in touch. Communication devices can be the most important piece of emergency equipment on board a vessel, especially in case of emergency. Be sure to have and know how to use at least two communication devices that work when wet, such as satellite phones, emergency position indicating radio beacons, VHF radios and personal locator beacons.\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your boat, the water, sunshine and fresh air responsibly.

The equipment, fully funded by the county, was purchased to reduce costs for local stations and increase safety for emergency responders.\nUntil now, fire companies had to pay for individual fit testing services, which added up in cost and required outside scheduling. With the new AeroFit system, once staff are trained, the tool can be used at any station, as well as other local emergency responders, to test firefighter masks, N95 respirators, gas masks and more.\nThis flexibility means the system will not only help volunteer fire departments but will strengthen readiness across all county emergency responders.\nProperly fitted masks are essential for protecting firefighters and other emergency personnel from hazardous smoke, chemicals and airborne particulates. With AeroFit's advanced technology, firefighters will know their equipment is performing as intended before entering dangerous environments.\n\"Providing our firefighters with the right tools is critical,\" stated Jimmy Eason, President of the Talbot County Volunteer Fire & Rescue Association \"With the county's support, this system ensures that every responder, whether volunteer, law enforcement, or emergency services staff, can be confident their protective equipment will keep them safe.\"\nThe purchase of the AeroFit system is part of Talbot County's ongoing investment in the safety of both residents and first responders. Each year, the county provides funding for the seven volunteer fire companies through its annual budget appropriation. Funding is distributed to each department by the Talbot County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association.\n\"This is about taking care of the people who take care of us,\" said council President Chuck Callahan. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury acquits man of all charges in fatal shooting\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton and Lilly Howard cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 978\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Donald Raymond Snyder Jr. pulled a 9mm handgun from his waistband in the driveway of his Elkton-area residence at approximately 9:20 p.m. on June 17 and, from close range, he fired two shots into the upper torso of his friend, Christopher Cimorose, who was in the driver's seat of a red Nissan Versa.Snyder, 41, and his defense lawyers maintained during the two-day-long trial this week that he shot Cimorose \u2014 killing him \u2014 in self-defense because Cimorose, 55, had threatened, \"I'm going to kill you, (expletive),\" while a \"metal pipe\" was resting on his lap.\nThe prosecution, however, contended that Snyder gunned down Cimorose \"in cold blood\" because Snyder's 41-year-old girlfriend, Michelle McCarthy, was ending their relationship and that Cimorose \u2014 her former boyfriend \u2014 had come to Snyder's residence to pick her up at McCarthy's request.\nOn Thursday morning, the jury acquitted Snyder of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and the eight related charges after about four hours of deliberations.\nAs the forelady announced the not guilty verdicts, Snyder lowered his head and appeared emotional while standing beside his Timonium-based lawyer, Joshua Insley, at the defense table. Then they embraced for several seconds. Bruce Saller, who wasn't present, served as Insley's co-counsel at trial.\nSnyder, who reiterated his self-defense account on the witness stand, was released from the Cecil County Detention Center on Thursday after his acquittal, court records indicate. Snyder had been incarcerated on no bond since his June 20 arrest.\nMaryland State Police investigators elected not to charge Snyder after interviewing him in the hours after the shooting because they lacked probable cause and they let him go home.\nBut on June 20, after viewing security-camera footage of the incident in the drivefway of Snyder's Locust Point Road residence, south of Elkton, and re-interviewing the sole eyewitness, McCarthy, detectives charged him with murder and other offenses.\nThe pertinent part of that video was played for jurors.\n\"Thirteen seconds, in real time, you are going to see the intentional, premeditated killing of Mr. Cimorose,\" Cecil County State's Attorney James Dellmyer told jurors Wednesday during his closing argument. \"This is evidence of first-degree murder. Chris (Cimorose) didn't stand a chance. That gun was on him before he got out of the car.\"\nThe footage starts with Snyder \"briskly walking up\" to the driver's side door and punching Cimorose in the face, according to Dellmyer, who prosecuted the case with Deputy State's Attorney Patricia Fitzgerald. State evidence included a photo of Snyder's right hand, which showed bruising on his knuckles, and a picture of an abrasion on Cimorose's forehead.\nAfter the car lurches forward a few feet, Snyder pulls the handgun as he walks forward to the driver's side door, gets into a shooting stance and rapidly fires three shots at Cimorose, including one errant round, Dellmyer reviewed.\nA person cannot be the aggressor and then claim self-defense, Dellmyer said. The video doesn't show Cimorose swinging the object or advancing, nor does it show Snyder retreating because of a perceived threat, he added.\n\"You cannot start a fistfight and then shoot someone to death,\" Dellmyer stressed, before asking, \"Is it reasonable to use deadly force?\"\nMcCarthy testified that Snyder hurled her cell phone, cracking the front, during a heated argument between the two shortly earlier that day and then alleged that Snyder, in anger, had broken five other cell phones of hers that year.\nMcCarthy told Snyder that she was leaving him during that dispute.\n\"I said, 'That's it. I'm done with you . . . I packed all my stuff in the car,\" McCarthy said.\nBut McCarthy could not legally drive her packed car because it lacked valid license plates \u2014 so she called Cimorose for a ride.\nMcCarthy testified that she was in the front passenger's seat of Cimorose's car when Snyder wordlessly sucker-punched Cimorose in the face and swiftly fired three shots. \"I saw the punch. I saw everything,\" she said.\nInsley, however, maintained that McCarthy wasn't a credible witness.\nThe defense lawyer proffered that the footage shows McCarthy outside Cimorose's car during the incident. Seconds earlier, McCarthy and Snyder had been inside her vehicle waiting for Cimorose to arrive.\nInsley also reminded jurors that McCarthy admittedly never mentioned Snyder throwing a punch during her first interview with investigators. \"I was covering a little bit for my boyfriend,\" McCarthy confessed on the witness stand.\nGuilt prompted McCarthy to contact police on June 19 and set up a second interview, in which she told investigators that Snyder punched Cimorose without provocation before the shooting, she testified. McCarthy testified that she and Cimorose were no longer romantically involved.\nWhen Insley asked McCarthy if she had asked the prosecution to dismiss two drug cases against her in exchange for her cooperation, she combatively responded, \"Drugs has nothing to to do with this case.\"\nAlso during Insley's cross-examination, McCarthy confirmed that Cimorose was on probation in a criminal case for strangling her.\nInsley reminded the jury during his closing argument Thursday that the autopsy report showed that Cimorose had methadone, cocaine and fentanyl and other drugs in his system at the time of his death.\n\"Ever smoke crack before,\" Ingsley rhetorically asked the jury, before remarking, \"I heard it makes you pretty wacky.\"\nThe defense also took exception to the state's interpretation of what the shadowy footage showed. The state contended that Snyder lunged forward and punched Cimorose, but Insley insisted that a thrown punch is not visible in the video.\nAs for the object Cimorose purportedly possessed, Insley accused investigators of \"sugar-coating\" by using words like stick, pole and a table leg to describe it, so it wouldn't be associated with a weapon. Insley referred to the object as a club. It looked like a wooden cane with a section of metal where the handle should have been.\nSnyder called 911; identified himself as the shooter; told the dispatcher he acted in self-defense and turned himself in after learning about the charges against him \u2014 all actions of an innocent man, according to Insley. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Diggs said they need donations and are optimistic to reach the goal, but they also need volunteers for the shelter: some cooks, but more importantly they need hosts and sleepers. The host, Diggs explained, meets and greets the guests, ensures they are comfortable and safe while the sleepers stay the whole night.\nDiggs announced this year they are aiming to open the shelter in December, a first.\nThat is up to the amount of volunteers that sign up. Diggs said that they have to have 85% of December filled to accomplish this, with volunteers especially needed Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's.\n\"Let's make this month a recruiting month. Help us do it because I think we certainly can. We're excited to be able to add December and maybe next year, add another month.\"\nAs winter approaches, the need increases to care for Kent County's homeless population he stated.\nAs their mission describes, the Samaritan Group of Kent County work with local agencies, churches, businesses and organizations and individuals to keep them warm and also providing financial assistance.\nDuring the rally with refreshments and ice cream served by Marcia Stoltzfus and family, Diggs listed the shelter's accomplishments and gave out certificates and awards to the hardworking, caring volunteers which make it possible each year, adding a fun family event along the fundraising.\nIn the early winter months of 2025, they served 21 clients, seven women, two children and 12 men, 661 bed nights total. In 2018 they served 21 people as well, 1,033 bed nights and that next year, 28 people and 921 bed nights.\n\"The number of people we serve is unpredictable. We just don't know from year to year. The point is to be ready and all of you volunteers make that possible.\"\nHe thanked some of the volunteers that helped get the shelter ready.\nReceiving the Laverne and Shirley Award was dynamic duo Annie Woodall and Andrea Nieman. Top Chef, and also supplying that tasty soft serve ice cream was Marcia Stoltzfus and family. The Host with the Most was Allison Brieske and Volunteer of the Year, who dedicated time cooking/ inspiring her whole church to cook, and hosting, was Anne-Marie Walters.\nMany other certificates given as well, some of whom were not in attendance.\n\"They may not be here, but they were when it counted,\" joked Diggs.\nGiving her testimony about the rewards of volunteering was Melanie Keller, who was recruited by Woodall and Nieman years back and was the volunteer coordinator for a time.\nKeller said that after her third child, part of what kept her volunteering was her two children who also volunteer. They play hide-and-seek with guests and see other people's experiences, their suffering and joys and practice reaching out with compassion.\n\"We are a community and I hope to see some of you as hosts,\" she told attendees.\nDiggs said hosts have a very important role, stay from 5:30-10 p.m. and are in pairs. Diggs personally greets the hosts each night and briefs them on what they need to know, ensuring they are comfortable.\nSleepers stay into the night and see guests off in the morning.\nDiggs encouraged the audience to not only sign up but to become recruits, sharing the joys of volunteering at the shelter where Mid-Shore Community Foundation, United Way of Kent County, the Good Neighbor Fund and Kent County Department of Social Services partner in this important mission.\n\"We need your help,\" Diggs said to the community. \"With it we can open up in December...one month at a time.\"\nTo contact them go to: info@samaritangroupofkentcounty.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officers rendered aid to all occupants and EMS arrived on scene and began rendering medical aid.\nThe driver, a juvenile male, and the front seat passenger, an adult woman, were transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The adult woman was later pronounced dead at the hospital, the attorney general's office said.\nThe two rear passengers, a juvenile male and an adult woman, were transported to an area hospital for treatment of serious injuries.

    "content": "Anton Black's cause of death should be ruled homicide, audit finds\n\n May 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 2018, the state medical examiner ruled that Anton Black's death at the hands of police in Greensboro was an accident. An audit report released by the state attorney general's office Thursday says the cause of death should have been ruled a homicide.The recommendation, one of dozens, comes after a four-year review of cases from between 2003 and 2019, during which time former Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler was in office. The audit ultimately evaluated 87 cases, reclassifying the cause of death from accidental, unknown or natural to homicide in 36 of them.\n\"The audit also validated concerns that bias may have affected death investigations in Maryland,\" Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a letter to Marylanders included with the report. \"Addressing those concerns benefits everyone in our system of justice \u2014 including the vast majority of law enforcement professionals who perform their duties with integrity and deserve clear, consistent standards.\"\nThe audit, led by Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, began in 2021 after Fowler's testimony in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin sparked outcry. Chauvin, who was convicted of murder for the 2020 death of George Floyd, knelt on Floyd's neck for up to nine minutes during an arrest.\nDuring his testimony, Fowler, who was called as an expert witness, said Floyd's death could be attributed to causes other than police restraint, including \"excited delirium,\" a term used to describe agitation and aggression related to mental health or substance abuse that has been disavowed by leading medical authorities. Over 450 medical experts co-signed a letter to former Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and others condemning Fowler's testimony.\n\"This audit marks the beginning of a long conversation \u2014 one that must be handled with honesty, delicacy, resolve, and deep consideration,\" Gov. Wes Moore said in a letter included in the Thursday report. Moore went on to highlight reforms in the medical examiner's office that have been underway for several years.\nThe 2023 settlement of a case brought by the Coalition for Justice for Anton Black and Black's family demanded changes including a policy addressing how medical examiners handle deaths in custody, including those involving law enforcement restraint, according to the ACLU of Maryland.\nThe policy incorporates and models guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners for determining how such deaths are investigated and how examiners determine causation.\nOn Sept. 15, 2018, Black, 19, and a 12-year-old family friend were walking around Greensboro when Black began pulling and dragging the child, who called out for help, garnering attention from onlookers that led to a 911 call.\nA chase that ensued ended outside Black's home, where Greensboro Police Officer Thomas Webster IV, off-duty Ridgely Police Chief Gary Manos, Centreville Police Officer Dennis Lannon and a civilian pinned Black against a wooden handicap ramp for six minutes while handcuffing and shackling him.\nBlack, who had severe bipolar depression, stopped breathing and became unresponsive after being handcuffed and shackled. He was taken to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton, where he was pronounced dead that evening.\nFowler ruled Black's cause of death was a sudden cardiac event. A later examination by a Johns Hopkins University cardiologist determined asphyxiation was the cause. No one was charged in the incident.\nFor those who have advocated for change in the way in-custody deaths are handled by the state since Black's death, the report released Thursday marked a potential turning point.\n\"This 70-page independent report vindicates what family members and communities \u2014 mostly Black and Brown Marylanders \u2014 have been saying for decades: the truth. That the entire system has been complicit in making police-involved deaths seem inevitable,\" said ACLU of Maryland senior staff attorney Sonia Kumar, who led the team that litigated the 2023 settlement, in a statement Friday.\nAn executive order issued by Moore Thursday called for the attorney general and the state's attorney's office to examine whether any cases should be reopened for investigation as a result of the report's findings. The executive order also established a task force to examine the handling of in-custody deaths.\nStar Democrat reporter Lily Tierney contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The weather organization is expecting a \"major winter storm\" will bring snow and ice across the country, \"from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic\" this weekend.\nSunday night, there is a 90% chance of precipitation in Easton with snow expected mainly after 1 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. On Monday, there is a 90% chance of precipitation in Easton with snow expected before 1 p.m. and then rain and snow likely. Monday night, there is a 50% chance of precipitation.\nTalbot County Public Schools Communications Director Debbie Gardner said the district is monitoring the forecast to determine if closures will be necessary.\nDorchester County Emergency Management Division Director Jimmy Windsor said Dorchester County has warned all its departments of the predicted weather, including its Highway Division. He said the county's Highway Division is preparing its inclement weather plans.\nVan Emburgh said on Friday that Easton was putting plows on the fronts of trucks and loading salt into the trucks that spread salt.\n\"And we have equipment that we're placing around town that we'll use to address alleys and some of the tighter spots that we plow,\" he said.\nWindsor said it is important that residents make sure they take the usual winter preparedness precautions, such as making sure vehicles have gas in them. He said that residents who live in areas that are prone to power outages should make sure they have blankets and warm clothing in the event of an outage.\n\"And a supply of fresh water in case the power goes out and you're on well water and therefore you rely on the power for your water source,\" he said.\nVan Emburgh said it's helpful if residents do not park their cars on main streets.\n\"When people park on the streets, we have to plow around the cars and sometimes that can \u2014 depending on how much snow we get \u2014 that can get tricky and then we plow the cars in,\" he said.\nVan Emburgh also talked about the importance of not plowing snow from the sidewalks into the street.\n\"Because we then plow it back onto the sidewalk,\" he said, laughing. \"It's just a battle. (Residents) plow it onto the street. We plow it back onto the sidewalk. And they get mad at us.\"\nVan Emburgh said residents should plow snow off their sidewalks by starting in the center of the street and working toward a house or building so that the snow is plowed into a yard.\n\"Some properties don't have yards,\" he said. \"But if you plow it out in the street, it's just going to get pushed back onto the sidewalk. So we ask that everything moves away from the center of the street.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton woman charged with placing swastikas on political signs\n\n May 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On Friday, police charged an Easton woman for allegedly placing swastika stickers on political signs and town property ahead of Easton's recent election.Jennifer Cristaudo, 53, has been charged with 20 counts of using a hate symbol, three counts of malicious destruction of property and one count of defacing property in a race/religion crime. All counts are misdemeanors.\nAccording to charging documents, Cristaudo allegedly placed six swastika stickers on political signs and 16 stickers with red lines through swastikas on town property, such as light poles and stop signs.\nThe six stickers placed on Gunsallus signs were all in \"high-minority areas,\" according to charging documents prepared by Detective Cory Schuch.\n\"The placement of a hate symbol, such as a swastika on campaign signs in these areas is a clear indication that Cristaudo's motivation was to intimidate minority voters in the Town of Easton to not vote for Frank Gunsallus,\" charging documents stated.\nPolice say the placement of the stickers began in late March and continued through early May. The election was held May 6.\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, on March 26, officers located three swastika stickers on Gunsallus signs. They reviewed surveillance video, which showed a woman driving a blue Subaru as the person placing the hate symbols.\nOn April 1, police discovered another defaced sign. April 28, officers found two more Gunsallus signs defaced near the Easton Amish Market.\nPer charging documents, police later found 16 swastika stickers with red lines throughout town, with 10 reported on April 1 and 2, and six reported between April 30 and May 6.\nAccording to court documents, a town official told police removing the stickers causes \"permanent damage\" to the signs, \"rendering them unusable.\" The town's public works department estimated $21,000 in replacement costs.\nIn addition to video footage linking Cristaudo to the stickers, court documents state police found a \"large roll of matching swastika stickers\" in Cristaudo's residence.\nMatching clothing and more stickers were found in her car, police said in charging documents.\nDuring the campaign, Gunsallus and his then-opponent Don Abbatiello both spoke out against sign vandalism. Gunsallus told The Star Democrat in March that \"these types of things shouldn't happen during a campaign.\"\n\"This act of hate has escalated the situation into a deeply troubling reality that demands our collective attention,\" Gunsallus wrote in a letter sent to The Star Democrat, local police and various local officials in March.\nRabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb, interim rabbi for Temple B'Nai Israel and Satell Center for Jewish Life on the Eastern Shore, said he was \"disappointed\" but not \"shocked\" by the use of hate symbols.\n\"I would say Easton and Talbot County are mostly a wonderful refuge from some of that national division,\" he said. \"But sadly, and maybe inevitably, pieces of that creep in.\"\nDobb said the placement of hate symbols is \"utterly unacceptable\" no matter the intent. \"Full-on continental devastation and genocide \u2014 which is the ultimate Nazi legacy \u2014 needs to be reserved for issues far greater than Town Council,\" Dobb said.\nLt. Milton Orellana, special operations commander for the Easton Police Department, said Monday that the department had also received a report of a Ku Klux Klan hood being placed on a Gunsallus sign during the campaign. Police were not sure who was behind that incident.\nOrellana said police are actively investigating both incidents. A preliminary hearing for Cristaudo is set for June 20.\nGunsallus declined to further comment on the situation, citing the ongoing investigation. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You will hear some success stories today,\" Price said.\nThe back row of the courtroom was packed with people supporting the graduates \u2014 Nichole Meredith, Samantha Mitchell and Carole Rawding. There were tearful testimonies to the power of this program. Love ones were showed the before and after pictures that marked the women's journey from the beginning of the program to the end.\nProblem Solving Coordinator Michelle Bethke spoke to the journey these women have taken and she presented certificates and flowers.\nEach graduate had a presenter. Meredith had lawyer Dana Boston, Mitchell had Whitely, and Rawding had Bethke.\nThere were lots of local dignitaries present, including Caroline County Commissioner Larry Porter, Sheriff Don Baker, Police Chief Geroge Bacorn and State's Attorney Sloan Franklin. Even Roger McKnight, MTU program administrator, was there.\nFrom state to county to town, there was community supporting these women to break the cycle of addiction and incarceration.\n\"It is an achievement and we are sending our graduates back out into the world to do good things,\" Price said.\nPrice noted the rigor of the program. Collectively the three graduates had submitted 382 drug tests. They completed 313 treatments of either substance abuse disorder or mental health treatment. They had to complete 146.25 hours of community service.\nBethke went up to the podium and addressed the crowded court room.\n\"The Caroline County Problem Solving Court employs science-based best practices to provide a pathway to sobriety for participants with diagnosed substance use disorders utilizing a combination of therapy, counseling, mentoring, encouragement and discipline when necessary,\" Bethke said.\nThe program received a $200,000 grant from the Maryland Office of Problem Solving Courts through a sub grant of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which helped provide the program's staffing.\nA graduate from 2022's program, and keynote speaker at the May 10 graduation, is Whiteley.\n\"I am a recovering addict and alumni from the Problem Solving Court. The definition of recovery is the process of change for which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life and strive,\" she said. \"The mindset and thinking pattern I once had, I needed to give up in order to change. Today I am a strong worthy loving and lovable woman, mother and friend.\"\nThe next speaker was Meredith.\n\"My addiction had taken everything that I ever loved away from me. I lost custody of my kids. I lost the trust and respect of my family. When I looked into the mirror, I didn't even recognize the person staring back at me,\" Meredith said. \"This program has saved my life. I have full custody of my kids now. My family and friends can depend on me.\"\nThe next to speak was Mitchell.\n\"Drug court has given me the resources I need when I need people,\" Mitchell said.\nThe final graduate, Rawding, was introduced by Bethke. Rawding was described as quiet and determined.\n\"I am just glad I accepted this program,\" Rawding said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Sheriff's Office to place cameras in patrol cars\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Talbot County Sheriff's Office is planning to add cameras to its patrol vehicles, a move that Sheriff Joe Gamble said will increase transparency with the public.Earlier this month, Talbot County council members approved the purchase of 30 in-car cameras for $415,000, spread across a five-year period. Body-worn cameras have their limits, Gamble said, only showing the steering wheel during situations like police chases.\nThe sheriff said the in-car cameras have two main benefits.\n\"One, it's another level of transparency with the public,\" Gamble said. \"And the other is evidence gathering.\"\nBut Gamble noted that a state investigation into a fatal police-involved chase last year factored into the decision.\n\"It definitely played a role in it,\" he said.\nIn July 2024, Talbot County deputies and an Easton police officer engaged in a pursuit of a vehicle on U.S. Route 50 in Easton after the driver failed to pull over for a traffic stop. Police reached speeds over 100 mph, and the chase ended with the vehicle crashing into a tree on Black Dog Alley. An 18-year-old passenger died.\nThe Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Attorney General's Office reviewed the incident, as it does for all fatal police-involved chases statewide. Body-worn camera footage was eventually released in September. It wasn't until January when state investigators determined they wouldn't seek charges against any of the involved officers.\nAt the time, Gamble said it shouldn't have taken that long for the state to complete its investigation and clear his deputies. Now, the in-car cameras will better show the actions taken by vehicles being pursued by police, he argues.\n\"You couldn't see the egregious disregard for public safety by the driver in that car,\" Gamble said in an interview this week, referencing the limited view of the chase provided by body-worn cameras.\n\"It protects our deputies in the sense that, this is what they did,\" he added. \"And if there's allegations they did something else, it's on footage.\"\nOther sheriffs on the Eastern Shore concur with the effectiveness of the cameras.\nQueen Anne's Sheriff Gary Hofmann said most patrol vehicles have had the in-car cameras for a few years. Complaints are down, and it's increased trust with the community, Hofmann says.\n\"It's been extremely beneficial for us to avoid any type of complaints or allegations,\" he said.\nDorchester Sheriff James Phillips said he would love for his agency to buy them, although cost is a problem \u2014 the in-car cameras are more expensive than body-worn ones.\nIn Caroline County, the vehicle cameras were purchased under a former sheriff, current Sheriff Donnie Baker noted. They are key in providing a better perspective for traffic stops and other incident, he said.\n\"I think that they make a good cop better,\" Baker said, \"and they limit false reports.\"\nGamble said the Talbot County Sheriff's Office hopes to install all 30 in-car cameras by 2026. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state is not prosecuting previously levied charges against Todd for attempted murder and assault.\nTodd was the last of four people to enter pleas for an incident that occurred in April 2024. Three others accused of assaulting Todd during the incident \u2014 21-year-old Tucker Eason, 19-year-old Blake Dorman and 18-year-old Navelie White \u2014 have pleaded guilty to assault charges. They were each handed sentences that they are currently serving.\nThe incident occurred in the parking lot of the Kohl's on April 16, 2024. The Easton Police Department said Todd fired a gun after an assault took place, according to a press release from when Todd was arrested in October 2024. Police spoke with a person whose truck had been hit by a bullet, allegedly from Todd's handgun.\nAccording to police, Todd told them that while in the parking lot that day, Eason hit him on the head with a beer bottle. Another person had a tire iron, Todd told authorities. Todd also told police he was punched several times.\nDetectives interviewed a witness who identified Eason, Dorman and White as the people who attacked Todd.\nAt the time, Easton police said video showed the attack during which Todd fired his gun after the assault ended with people fleeing the area.\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan sentenced Todd to one year for reckless endangerment with the full term suspended, and two years for the handgun charge with all but 212 days suspended. Todd was credited with 212 days served dating back to last November. Cronan ordered Todd to serve two years on probation and perform community service, among other conditions.\nWhite, of Easton, entered an Alford plea for first-degree assault on March 21. He was sentenced to eight years with all but 18 months suspended, dating back to January.\nEason, of Easton, pleaded guilty in December 2024 to second-degree assault and was sentenced to a three-year term with all but 18 months suspended. The 18 months date back to October 2024.\nDorman, of St. Michaels, pleaded guilty on June 4 to second-degree assault and rioting. A three-year sentence for the rioting was fully suspended. For the assault count, Cronan delivered a three-year sentence with all but 18 months suspended, dating to June 3. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bodman, who is charged with manslaughter, distribution and possession with the intent to distribute narcotics, distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl or heroin, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, reckless endangerment and conspiracy.Police also announced that Elina Lazarieva, 23, of Easton was arrested in Baltimore on Aug. 2 on similar charges.The charges stem from the duo's alleged involvement in an overdose death in Easton.Easton officers were dispatched to the 100 block of Prospect Avenue on Sept. 5, 2022, for an unresponsive man.Talbot County paramedics also responded and pronounced the man, identified as 28-year-old Cristian Gonzales, dead.Easton police's criminal investigation division initiated an investigation, learning that Lazarieva had met with Bodman for the purpose of obtaining controlled dangerous substances.Police said Lazarieva contacted Bodman and the two traveled to Delaware to obtain heroin.After obtaining the heroin, the two traveled back to Easton and delivered the drug to Gonzales, who later overdosed, police said.Both Bodman and Lazarieva were turned over to the Talbot County Detention Center following their arrests.Lazarieva was released on bond Sept. 12, according to online court records. Her case is scheduled for a jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court in early January. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A date remembered and honored by many in Queen Anne's County for the last 22 years the Fallen Heroes Memorial continues to be observed Feb. 13. Hosted by Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 108, the location has varied through the years but was held this year at the Centreville United Methodist Church.The event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence led by Sheriff Gary Hoffman. Senior Pastor Rev. Karen Handy of Centreville Methodist Church welcomed and addressed families, friends, and community members.\nChase Armington, past president of Lodge 108 and current Queen Anne's County deputy, began, \"Tonight, we gather to honor our fallen heroes. It is our duty to never forget them, for they have paved the path forward with their lives. The path leading us here tonight was born from tragedy. Incredible losses. Unbearable pain for our families, friends, and the community. These honored in front of you served our community with pride, dignity, and honor. Knowing their lives could, at any moment be taken, so that we may live. So that we may continue on the path they have now paved.\"\nThe event started from tragedy, continues years later as a way to honor and remember those who have unselfishly given their lives for others. Sue Nickerson, who lost her son, Centreville Police Officer Michael Nickerson, in 2001 explains, \"The FOP from QAC started [this event] and they will always have it on February 13th, the night that Michael [Nickerson] and Jason [Schwenz, Queen Anne's County deputy] were killed. But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County.\"\nNickerson is the Maryland Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS) Director.\nAs a mother who lost her son, this event is near to her heart. Nickerson said, \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters, and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\"\nFirst responders marched in for the Presentation of Colors, holding flags to honor those lost in the line of duty. Queen Anne's County State's Attorney, Lance Richardson, spoke about stoicism and how it applies here. \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\"\nRichardson went on to quote the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, \"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive \u2014 to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.\" Applying this quote, Richardson said, \"So, tonight, we honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, their lives, so we could go on living our lives in peace and safety.\" He ended by encouraging all to 'earn this.' \"We must continue to honor these brothers and sisters, live a life that would be a testament to their memory, and continue to do God's will and God's work.\"\nDuring this powerful remembrance, family members came, first responder representatives saluted, and all placed long-stemmed red roses by the framed photographs. The names of the fallen heroes were read along with the date of their End of Watch. Ten Queen Anne's County residents and fallen heroes' pictures filled the front table: Queen Anne's-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company's Daniel Lister, Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company''s \"Buck\" Clough, Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department's \"Dougie\" Thomas, United Community Volunteer Fire Department''s David Brinkley, Centreville Police Department's Michael Nickerson, QA Sheriff's Deputy Jason Schwenz, DNR Warden Charles Rider, and Maryland State Police troopers Thomas Noyle, Philip Russ, and Wallace Mowbray.\nRadio transmission echoed for all to hear to mark the ultimate sacrifice given on that fateful Feb. 13, 2001, \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Bagpipes played 'Amazing Grace' from the balcony overhead. Silence filled every space of the church.\nHandy closed, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The 911 operator listened, gave me directions, kept me calm and told me that the medical team was on its way. Within 15 minutes of the call, the crew arrived. I call it a crew because at least two trucks from the Easton fire department accompanied the ambulance.\nThe fire department members shoveled the snow off the entrance to my house within a matter of minutes to give a safer passageway for the EMS crew. The EMS crew handled my wife's situation quickly and efficiently, moved her to the ambulance for transport to the emergency room. They kept apologizing for bringing snow into the house \u2014 the least of my concerns.\nThe entire team put themselves at risk to help us. The quickness of their response, especially considering the weather, was amazing.

At the time of those charges, Jenkins was on probation for a second degree assault conviction in 2022.\nJenkins was taken to the Talbot County Central Booking Center. Police said he was held pending further court action.\nJenkins is scheduled for a hearing in Talbot County for traffic violations and drug possession, and on a subsequent date for violation of probation. He is also scheduled for a June hearing in Dorchester County on the attempted murder charge.\nThe Cambridge Police Department, along with the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office assisted in the incident. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County may need to add to detention center\n\n October 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 The Dorchester County detention center is struggling to keep up with increases in the number of juveniles incarcerated and may ask for money to build a new wing to house the young offenders.During a Tuesday County Council meeting, council members decided to prioritize the topic for the upcoming Maryland General Assembly legislative session.\nDuring a final discussion on priorities for the legislative session, Councilmember Mike Detmer, talked about what he described as his \"juvenile crime concern.\"\nIn his comments, Detmer said juvenile crime in Dorchester County has been on the rise and the crimes being committed are more than simply jaywalking.\n\"It's absolutely insane that we have so many people that have had direct and directly affected by this, multiple people in this room directly affected by juvenile crime,\" Detmer said. \"And it's unbelievable that in 2024 that we can be in a place of all the resources and all the talent we have that are wearing badges, that we can be in a place where we're held hostage by ostensibly well intentioned laws.\"\nDetmer pleaded with council to put emphasis on juvenile crime for the Maryland General Assembly legislative session. He reminded the council of stories he shared on juvenile crime during previous meetings including children as young as 10 with guns and speeding cars on U.S. Route 50 and state Route 16 by underage drivers.\n\"There are kids that are still kids on paper,\" Detmer said. \"(But) they're not acting like children.\"\nCouncil President George Pfeffer, said the topic is on the list and there's no priority on the list created. Pfeffer described the topics on the list as \"equally important to us\" and said they will emphasize the importance of those topics once there is a legislator in front of them.\nThe list will be discussed with the local contingent of state delegates and senators.\nLater on in the meeting Councilmember Ricky Travers, added that he agreed with Detmer and said he had issue with the way the juvenile justice system functions and said the system is \"setting up a whole group of young kids for failure.\"\nDuring public comment, detention center Warden Don Satterfield shared that over the last two months the detention center has had seven juveniles waiting for adult status.\nSatterfield said because the state of Maryland has passed laws stating that juveniles must be housed separately by \"vision and audio,\" those regulations have created a difficult barrier with the increase of juveniles being sent to adult detention centers.\nSatterfield shared that the current detention center is almost 34 years old and is not designed to accommodate increased numbers of juveniles.\n\"Unfortunately, I'm going to be coming before you to add a wing (to the center),\" Satterfield said. \"That's where we are with this. We are already in violation of the law because of the audio part, and every other facility in the states is pretty much the same way. But this is where we are with the juvenile situation, and I don't see it concluding. And they are, quite frankly, they're a holy terror.\"\nAfter hearing comment from Satterfield, Pfeffers suggested in addition to the rise in juvenile crime, that they discuss the restrictions placed on detention centers could possibly force the county to build another wing to the detention facility.\nThe council unanimously agreed to add the topics to the county's legislative priorities.\nDorchester is not the only county facing questions of outdated detention centers. Earlier this week, Caroline County commissioners discussed plans to join with Queen Anne's and Kent counties to build a new center, in part to deal with the increase in juvenile inmates.\nIn a March article in The Star Democrat, Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd talked about the growing challenge of juvenile crime in Dorchester County's largest city.\n\"Through investigation and statistical analysis, we have determined that the overwhelming suspect profiles for these crimes are male juveniles under the age of 16,\" according to a Cambridge police report. \"But we have detained suspects as young as 11 for stealing vehicles in Cambridge.\"\nAccording to the report, there is one 12-year-old who has been arrested for vehicle theft 11 times in the past three years. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jeff Adams chose the Greensboro Police Department as his next endeavor because of his great relationship with Police Chief Lenox Trams.\"I was looking at different agencies but I reached out the chief. Chief and I go back to 2005 or 2006,\" Adams said. \"I didn't know if I wanted to come here or not. We just had a brief conversation, then I came and did an interview and instantly fell in love. Ever since talking to him and doing a ride along, I was pretty much sold.\"\nAdams, originally from New Jersey, came to the Eastern Shore in 2004 after his career in the military. Adams served in the Navy and in the Army Reserve.\nA friend talked to him about coming down to the Eastern Shore and pursing law enforcement as a career.\nAdams started his career in law enforcement in dispatch at Easton Police Department for one year. Then Adams moved to the Federalsburg Police Department, where he served for the past 17 years.\nWhile Adams and Trams' long relationship played a big part in his decision to pick Greensboro as his next stop, Adams' residence in Greensboro played a big part as well.\n\"I think the people here are very nice,\" Adams said. \"They're genuine, and it just seem like a really good fit after we went for a ride along. Just the environment alone was was good enough.\"\nAdams wants residents to know if they ever cross paths with him, he is a easy officer to work with.\n\"I'm easy going,\" Adams said. \"So what you see is what you get. I think Chief can attest to that, but I'm just laid back, professional, polite and kind. Hopefully we'll be community-oriented. We're just trying to make our interactions are police-public friendly.\"\nAdams brings a potential coworker with him to the department. His K-9 Mosley has been with him since 2017.\nMosley has experienced cancer, but Adams says she is still able to work as a K-9 dog.\n\"She's done everything,\" Adams said. \"She's already certified in tracking and narcotics. Now we took off the tracking because she lost her leg to cancer in Halloween of 2023. She went through chemo, radiation, and she's she's still working. She's did awesome with the training last Wednesday, she nailed it.\"\nWhile Mosley hasn't officially joined the force yet, Trams and Adams expect for her to be apart of the team very soon.\n\"We're really excited to be able to bring her on,\" Trams said. \"We're going through our budget cycle, and we put the K-9 program in the budget so the Town Council has to approve it. Hopefully we'll get the thumps up and then she can start working because we need one.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Russell III handed down the prison term to Samuel Charles Hardeman, 55. His prison term will be followed by lifetime supervised release.\nHardeman had a previous federal conviction in a 2002 case in the Northern District of Georgia for use of a computer to entice a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 174 months in prison.\nUpon his release from prison, Hardeman must continue to register as a sex offender in the places where he resides, where he is an employee and where he is a student, under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, per the judge's order.\nThe sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron, Acting Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office and Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble.\nAccording to the guilty plea, from Dec. 11, 2022, through Dec. 26, 2022, Hardeman engaged in conversations with an undercover law enforcement officer who purported to have a 10-year-old daughter.\nDuring the conversations, Hardeman expressed how he wanted to have sex with the 10-year-old, sent a video containing child pornography to the undercover officer and made plans to drive to New York, where the undercover officer purportedly lived, to have sex with the 10-year-old.\nHardeman communicated with the undercover officer by phone via video call, text and through the use of encrypted messaging platforms.\nThe Maryland U.S.\nAttorney's Office said the conversations occurred while Hardeman was on the sex offender registration for a previous federal sex offense conviction.\nDuring a call on Dec. 26, 2022, Hardeman expressed hesitation about traveling to New York to visit the undercover officer and her daughter. The officer did not hear from Hardeman after that time.\nOn March 14, 2023, a federal search warrant was executed at Hardeman's residence, where several electronic devices were seized.\nA forensic examination of one of the phones revealed the encrypted messaging account which Hardeman used to communicate with the undercover officer, a text message thread between Hardeman and the officer, photos sent to Hardeman by the officer at Hardeman's request, the photos and videos that Hardeman sent to the officer and dozens of images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\nForensic examinations of several other devices and Hardeman's cloud storage account recovered additional images of child sex abuse material, including bestiality.\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.\nLed by the United States Attorney's Offices and the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children and to identify and rescue victims.\nFor more information about Project Safe Childhood, visit justice.gov/psc. For more information about Internet safety education, visit justice. gov/psc and click on the \"Resources\" tab on the left of the page.\nBarron commended the FBI and the Talbot County Sheriff 's Office for their work in the investigation.\nBarron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Spencer Todd and Paul E. Budlow, who prosecuted the federal case. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Over a hundred people attended the event that included dancing, food, a silent auction and a raffle.\nMichael Feehley, chair of the 1622 Veterans Affairs Committee and a lead planner for the event, said the committee believes in doing what they can to provide for those veterans in need and this event was a way to raise funds for veterans that are often overlooked.\n\"We believe in taking care of veterans, the veterans that use services at Pleasant Day, whether it's just for two meals, whether it's for medications, whether it's to meet with medical people, whether it's transportation to their medical appointments, they're only funded for two days a week through (Veteran Affairs), we feel it's necessary to fund those guys for five days,\" Feehley said.\nThroughout the event, veterans were honored by attendees and volunteers but also by potential new recruits. Feehley said Easton High School's Navy Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps members assisted in functions such as drawing tickets, helping people to their seats and any assistance needed including putting away chairs at the end of the evening.\nTom Carlson, Vietnam veteran and member of the Easton Elks 1622 Veterans Affairs Committee, said the event provided him the opportunity to be around more veterans and talk about their experiences between enjoying the music and dancing.\nCarlson said he was surprised by the enjoyment of the guests when it came to the music being played. Guests of a variety of ages were in attendance that evening singing along to songs of Carlson's youth and flooding the dance floor.\n\"It wasn't just people in their 60s and 70s and 80s. There were a lot of people in their 20s and 30s, and they had a great time too,\" Carlson said. \"It's amazing that some of these youngsters really knew the music. They know our songs that we grew up with.\"\nFeehley said he was proud of the ability to organize an event to honor veterans in the area, and he advises anyone who comes across a veteran to take the time to honor them even in the smallest ways.\n\"When you see that Army hat or the Coast Guard bumper sticker on the back of a car, or anything that says, 'Hey, I was in the service,' say, 'Thank you for your service.'\"\n\"Because that veteran, the person who wears that hat, or the person who drives that car, they gave an awful lot of themselves,\" Feehley said. \"They took time away from their families, away from home, in some but not all cases, they put themselves in danger, so you and I can do what we do today, and who are we not to give back to those people.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Residents are advised to follow certain protocols to keep celebrations safe.\nMaster Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver Alkire recommends residents to go to public fireworks shows. For those who are dead-set on setting fireworks off themselves, Alkire doesn't recommend going over state lines to purchase fireworks.\n\"If you are going to be using any fireworks, just to keep in mind that you should only be purchasing and using fireworks that you are buying within your county or your area,\" he said. \"... Anything that you can purchase at a roadside stand, I can assure you, has been inspected, or anywhere in any retail stores.\"\nThe most important thing Alkire emphasizes is only adults should handle fireworks.\n\"If you're going to light fireworks, only allow the adults to light the fireworks, only light one firework at a time, and also keep all children and pets away from fireworks,\" he said.\nFor those handling fireworks at home, Easton Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson recommends to have a water hose nearby and ready in case of a fire.\nFor fireworks that light and don't work, Alkire recommends putting the fireworks in a bucket of water for 24 hours, then disposing of them properly.\nThe state fire marshal's office recommend not putting fireworks anywhere on the body. In 2023, there were two deaths in Maryland resulting from people holding fireworks to their chest or head.\nIn the event of an emergency, people are advised to call 911 for assistance. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Fassett and her organizers love to hold a community event on the first Friday prior to giving the community more events to attend and more opportunities to get out and meet their neighbors, she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the matter is now being taken to federal court.\nFormer Police Chief Jeff Eckrich, six former officers and a former employee have filed a lawsuit, alleging that town officials and Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker formed a \"coup\" to disband RPD.\nAmong many claims, the lawsuit asserts that Baker and former Ridgely officer James Joles \"devised a plan that would eliminate the RPD and allow the Sheriff's Office\" to take over policing in the town.\"\nJoles, who resigned in 2024 and provided documentation to town officials that led to a state investigation into Eckrich for alleged misconduct, spoke to The Star Democrat on Wednesday. He denied claims made in the lawsuit.\nTo learn more about Joles' comments and the lawsuit itself, read our story below.\nThanks for reading.\n\u2014 Konner Metz \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had no idea he was about to be killed \"execution-style,\" said Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, who is prosecuting the case with Senior Assistant State's Attorney Ella Disharoon.\nWilliams, wearing a mask, approached Daniels with a gun, shooting him in the back. Then, he shot again, striking Daniels in the head twice before taking Daniels' belongings and leaving.\nAlthough a Cambridge resident on his way home that night found Daniels' body lying facedown on Pleasant Street within minutes of the shooting, and police and emergency medical services personnel performed CPR, Daniels was pronounced deceased at the scene.\nDaniels' death was ruled a homicide by multiple gunshot wounds, two of which were \"rapidly fatal,\" a state medical examiner testified Tuesday afternoon.\n\"He didn't stand a chance,\" Leonard said during her opening statement.\nHowever, Williams didn't count on surveillance cameras from local businesses capturing the shooting, she said.\nWilliams also didn't count on police arresting him while he was wearing the same backpack from the night of the shooting, or police finding Daniels' phone in his pocket, Leonard added.\nWilliams was arrested the next evening following a foot pursuit on Lincoln Terrace. After he attempted to flee, a Cambridge police officer fired, shooting Williams in the leg.\nBut to defense attorneys Michelle Moodispaw and Stephanie DeLang, evidence shown by prosecutors would not prove Williams guilty.\nVideo surveillance and forensics presented by prosecutors have limited value, Moodispaw said, urging the jury to consider evidence that wasn't being shown.\nThe only thing to be presented was \"maybes and possibilities,\" she said.\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, seven witnesses had testified, including Daniels' mother, police officers, crime scene technicians and the medical examiner.\nAdditional law enforcement witnesses and forensic analysts are expected to testify Wednesday. A verdict is anticipated Friday.\nThis week's trial is not the only pending case against Williams.\nWilliams is also accused in a second fatal shooting in Cambridge, which occurred roughly three hours after Daniels was shot.\nAround 10 p.m. Dec. 8, 2022, police responded to the 700 block of High Street for a second gunshot victim, who was identified as Lory Eugene Fields, 69, of Cambridge.\nFields was found lying in a yard with a gunshot wound to his head. He was declared deceased at the scene.\nWilliams is facing additional murder and robbery charges in connection to Fields' death.\nThough the shootings happened within hours of each other and all charges appear to be grouped together in Maryland Judiciary court records, Williams is set to stand for a second trial related to Fields' death in mid-January. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n\n Pleasant Street near the intersection with Race Street in Cambridge is the scene of the first fatal shooting that occurred Thursday evening, Dec. 8, 2022.\n\n FILE PHOTO\n\n Tire tracks line Pleasant Street in Cambridge where a fatal shooting occurred Thursday evening, Dec. 8, 2022. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When a first responder is in need of help, they can contact a peer member.\nKintop says the program is designed so first responders don't have to \"go through the ranks\" for mental health assistance.\n\"The idea is that they can come from the bottom up, meaning that they will know who all the peer (team members) are,\" Kintop said. \" \u2026 They will be able to contact who they want to contact.\"\nKintop and fellow members of Talbot FiRST!'s steering committee \u2014 made up of heads from all of the agencies \u2014 were applauded by the Talbot County Council on Oct. 22 for the initiative.\nCounty Manager Clay Stamp, a former Talbot County emergency services director, commended the program for being the first of its kind in Maryland.\n\"The things that we expose our 18-year-old kids to \u2014 that become EMTs or dispatchers or police officers \u2014 are horrendous,\" Stamp said on Oct. 22. \"We have got to come up with a better way to arm these individuals to deal with these things in a healthy manner and to give them a support system.\n\"And right here in Talbot County, out of the 23 counties and Baltimore City, they've stepped up, and they're making it happen first.\"\nFormer EMS Division Chief Matt Watkins said it's a step very few first responder communities around the country have taken, adding, \"Talbot County should be extremely proud of the fact that we're on the cutting edge of this.\"\nKintop and Watkins have been involved in creating the program for more than a year. A training by former New York City Police Department detective and crisis negotiator Jeff Thompson ignited their enthusiasm for the project.\nKintop called the four-day training \"rigorous,\" yet said all of the first responders who attended were committed to learning from Thompson's life experiences.\n\"By the time the day was over, you didn't even know you were there for eight hours. It was so engaging, and everybody felt the same way,\" Kintop said. \" \u2026 It brought up all the things that maybe I didn't seek help for, that I just kind of sucked it up and handled it on my own.\"\nKintop says the peer program will be completing a second phase of training soon to expand the peer team, along with doing outreach to first responder agencies. Her hope is that Talbot FiRST! becomes a model up and down the Eastern Shore.\nFor All Seasons CEO Beth Anne Dorman said funding from the Rural Maryland Council made the nonprofit's clinical training with the Talbot County first responders possible. In fiscal year 2024, the Rural Maryland Council awarded a $30,000 grant to For All Seasons meant to aid the organization in training first responder agencies across the Mid-Shore.\nTalbot County Council President Chuck Callahan recalled the stigma around mental health in the first responder community when he first volunteered as a firefighter at 18 years old.\n\"You kind of feel like you're out there alone sometimes, and you need to talk to somebody,\" Callahan said at the Oct. 22 meeting. \"Sometimes, the stuff that we do feels like it's forgotten.\n\"As long as we're up here, you guys are never ever going to get forgotten,\" Callahan said, \"because you're our heroes in Talbot County, and we love you guys and you protect us.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) wants to secure federal funding to help.The Trappe Volunteer Firehouse was completed in 1951 and has not been updated since. \"We probably have the oldest one in the county,\" Assistant Secretary Treasurer of the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company Cheryl Lewis said.\nLewis said a new firehouse is necessary because the current building is no longer suitable for the modern equipment.\nBecause Trappe has a volunteer fire company, like many towns on the Eastern Shore, projects like this rely heavily on government and local support, Lewis said.\n\"We've been in the process of trying to get assistance,\" Lewis said. \"In the last budget year, the federal budget that was just approved, we had successfully worked with Andy Harris's office to be included in the budget. But with the cuts that were done early on this year, it was removed.\"\nHarris said the appropriations bill to provide funding for the project failed due to negotiations in Congress leading to a continued delay, but she said the project has been reapplied for in the current year's legislation.\n\"We hope the appropriations process has a better outcome, but then that's not up to us because it involves the minority party as well,\" he said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nIn order to qualify for federal grants, the company must match 25% of the projected project cost of $6 million. The company set a goal of $1,500,000 and set aside $450,000 to begin the efforts.\nFundraising efforts include The Trappe Volunteer Fire Company's upcoming annual fair, held on July 31 through Aug. 2 at the firehouse. The event begins at 6 p.m. and ends at 10 p.m. each day and will include fire truck rides, hay rides, food, games and prizes, and live entertainment, according to the fire company's Facebook page. Saturday's event will open with a parade.\nHarris said the outcome of federal funding depends on the successful bipartisan negotiations in Congress to pass this version of the appropriations bill.\n\"In the end, this is going to depend on the minority party. And you know, if they're not willing to negotiate in good faith, that could end up being a problem,\" Harris said. \"The people in Trappe have to know that their member of Congress was working hard to get that money to the fire company.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Multiple crashes at Easton intersection lead to resident concerns\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 630\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A recent string of crashes at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Aurora Street have ignited resident calls for traffic and safety improvements.Monday morning, residents Lydia Pinkney and Tony Ruffini stood on the sidewalk of Aurora Street, discussing their safety concerns for the residential area that is home to many families and children.\n\"You stand out here for about five, ten minutes, you'll see how fast people go,\" Ruffini said. \"It's insane. They don't care, and they're always in a hurry.\"\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, the intersection has seen three crashes this month, all due to driver error. There were only 13 in the last 11 years, police said.\nTown engineers reviewed the traffic light, which was confirmed as operational. In a Facebook post, the police department encouraged drivers to be cautious and stated the intersection will be monitored.\n\"While this location is being monitored, officers have begun targeted traffic enforcement and will continue to do so at different hours of the day,\" the department wrote.\nPinkney said she's worried for the safety of her 9-year-old daughter and her dog when walking up and down Aurora Street near the intersection. She says a car has careened into her yard before, and many neighbors have had their parked cars damaged.\nPinkney believes part of the issue is drivers may be unaware it is a residential area.\n\"The speed limit's 25, and I know people are going more than 25,\" she said. \"Our kids play out here. And what worries me about everything is if \u2026 someone's not paying attention or whatnot, them running the red light or just going way too fast and clipping me and my daughter.\"\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said the town is looking at what it can do with the intersection's traffic light in terms of safety and timing.\nEaston's engineers recently adjusted the timing of the intersection's traffic light, hoping to lower the \"chances of a collision if a driver attempts to beat a red light,\" the Easton Police Department announced Tuesday.\nDiscussion around safety on Brookletts Avenue has been recurring. This month, the town installed four-way stop signs at two other Brookletts intersections, South Harrison Street and Hanson Street. The intersections previously had two stop signs each.\nVan Emburgh said thus far, feedback on the four-way stop signs has been positive. Resident Lisa Stone lives next to the intersections and said she's happy with the change.\n\"I have seen so many near accidents at the intersections, particularly Hanson and Brookletts,\" Stone said. \" \u2026 I think that's a good improvement.\"\nThe town also added on-street parking lines to Brookletts Avenue, a measure that Van Emburgh said will improve safety on the wide, two-way street.\n\"The white lines give the drivers cues as to where they're supposed to be in the travel lanes,\" Van Emburgh said. \"Because one of the things that we struggle with is when you have a road that can accommodate on-street parking, but no one's actually parking on it, it looks like a wide-open raceway.\"\nFor many neighbors, traffic and safety concerns only grow as developers revamp a nearby property formerly owned by Perdue AgriBusiness. Last week, Easton's Planning Commission approved the majority of a 123-unit proposal for the site along Brookletts Avenue.\nDevelopers had Lenhart Traffic Consulting prepare a traffic impact study, which recommended project approval. Per Planning Commission documents, the study found redevelopment will have \"minimal impact on the surrounding road network.\"\nRuffini said with the new development and an eventual increase in traffic, South Aurora Street \"will be a main road before you know it.\"\nStone, meanwhile, is excited to see the redevelopment, given it includes commercial space and affordable housing. But she's keeping an eye on its impacts to driver and pedestrian safety.\n\"Hopefully it will just be an increase in traffic and not a decrease in safety,\" Stone said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trial begins for Cambridge man accused of murder, kidnapping of woman\n\n September 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Witness testimony began Tuesday in the jury trial for a Cambridge man charged with murdering and kidnapping a woman last year.Kenneth Bradley, 43, is charged with first- and second-degree murder and kidnapping, among other counts, in connection to the disappearance and presumed death of Tiyavauna Britt on Feb. 7, 2024, at the Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh in Cambridge.\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors made their first appeal to the jury, asking for first-degree murder and kidnapping convictions. The defense is vying for not-guilty verdicts on those counts, contending that second-degree murder or manslaughter are more appropriate charges.\nBradley and Britt, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been dating, according to multiple accounts provided during trial Tuesday and prior court documents. They were allegedly together in the parking lot of the park on Feb. 7, 2024, before Britt disappeared.\nEaston police put out a missing persons report for Britt six days later. Family had found her car abandoned in an Easton parking lot.\nCambridge police, along with state homicide detectives, assumed the investigation from Easton authorities following the review of cell phone location data placing Britt at the park.\nBradley was initially arrested on kidnapping charges in February 2024. Review of camera footage at the park from Feb. 7 revealed \"sounds of loud thuds ... consistent with forceful strikes,\" police wrote in charging documents. Later that night, footage showed a man \"carrying and dragging\" a woman's body to a vehicle, police wrote.\nBradley was indicted and arrested on murder charges in March 2024. Britt's body was not found.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, the lead prosecutor, and public defender Matt Connell, who is representing Bradley, provided opening statements Tuesday.\nLeonard told the jury the case is full of \"rage, control, domestic violence.\" Evidence shows Britt's relationship with Bradley was \"toxic,\" she said.\nLeonard said Bradley's former employer and a close friend will testify later this week. Bradley confided in them, she said, confessing to the murder and the disposing of Britt's body.\n\"She vanished,\" Leonard said. \"She was never seen or heard from again. No phone calls or text messages.\"\nLeonard said jurors will see video footage from the park. The audio is \"chilling,\" she said, showing Bradley drag Britt and throw her in the trunk of a car.\nBefore jurors took their seats to listen to openings, Connell objected to some of the audio evidence, arguing that Bradley could have a \"reasonable expectation\" for privacy during some of the conversations.\n\"We are fine acknowledging that that was him in the video,\" Connell said. \" ... 90% of the verbal communication occurred inside the vehicle.\"\nLeonard disagreed with the 90% assessment. Connell said, \"it's possible I'm mistaken.\"\nWhile the full video and accompanying audio wasn't admitted as evidence Tuesday, Judge William Jones sided with the prosecution. It's \"quite likely\" the court will allow its admission during trial, the judge said, especially if the conversations included yelling.\nIn Connell's opening statement, he acknowledged Bradley's involvement in Britt's death. But he said prosecutors must show Bradley intended to kill Britt in order for the jury to deliver a guilty verdict on first-degree murder.\n\"He lost it. He hit her too hard, and she died,\" Connell said, adding that Bradley tried to resuscitate Britt. \"He didn't mean to do it.\"\n\"Hold him responsible for what he's really guilty of, not above and beyond that,\" the defense attorney said.\nThirteen witnesses testified Tuesday, including close family of Britt and police detectives who worked the case.\nLinda Harris, Britt's mother, recalled Feb. 12, 2024 during an emotional testimony. It was her other daughter's birthday, and Britt didn't show up.\n\"She wouldn't miss anything,\" Harris said of birthday parties and holidays. The mother said she last saw Britt a week before she disappeared.\nTrial is scheduled to continue through Friday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In March of 2024, the town suspended the entirety of its police department amid a state investigation.\nOn July 25, 2024, an investigation report by the Office of the State Prosecutor found no \"sufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution.\" By that time, the Ridgely officers had already been laid off.\nMonday's decision came after a discussion at last month's commissioners meeting about three potential options to continue policing for the town.\n\"I know last month we talked about three options, one completely going back to the sheriff's department regular patrol pattern,\" Sears said. \"Second was to attempt to re-establish an original police force, and even that price was conservatively estimated at $852,000 for the first year if we could find the police officer.\"\nThe third option was to continue the MOU with the county.\nThe cost for the services of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office would be $493,415 on the fiscal year 2026 budget.\nThe Sheriff advocated for his office to continue its agreement with the town.\n\"The sheriff's office is providing what is going to be a high quality of law enforcement in the town,\" Caroline County Sheriff Donald Baker said in an interview. \"The town going with the MOU with the sheriff's office, they get everything the sheriff's office has to provide as far as criminal investigations handled by a investigator or detective, as well as the sheriff's office is a member of the Caroline County Drug Task Force and we have two deputies assigned to that.\"\nMultiple questions were brought up by town residents regarding where the $493,415 would go. Baker clarified to residents and commissioners how the funds would be broken down.\n\"There was some confusion that this money is dumped right into the Sheriff's Office budget. That's not true,\" Baker said. \"The county is billing the town based upon the usage. So, if we don't use something or there's money left over, the county does not bill it and it goes back to the town or the town keeps it and it's never filled.\"\nThe vote to continue the MOU was unanimous. Commissioner John Hurley was absent from the meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Antoine Patton and Lt. Greg McCray spoke at the town hall.Patton spoke about some of the things the department does to increase positive interactions with the community.\"If you look on the news, it would have you to believe sometimes that police officers are only there when bad things happen,\" he said. \"But we want our community to know that we love them, and we're here to work together.\" Patton mentioned how the department takes children and senior citizens Christmas shopping every year. This year, he said he had the idea for \"12 Days of Christmas\" where the department will take children and senior citizens out shopping from Dec. 12 through Dec. 24.Patton talked about a Thanksgiving dinner the department hosted last year and plans to host again this year.\"In five to 10 years these children will be teenagers and these teenagers will remember the things that we did,\" he said.Todd shared some of the city's crime data at the meeting as well.Since 2019, the Cambridge Police Department has taken 114 illegal guns off the streets, he said.Compared the the record number of seven homicides in Cambridge last year, Todd said there have been two homicides so far in 2023.\"I don't call that success by any means,\" he said. \"The day we have zero is the day we've been successful. [[---]] But it's progress. And that's what we have to keep banking on as we keep getting better as a community and a city.\" Todd said the number of juvenile crimes (committed by those under 18) is \"continuously getting worse.\" \"Out of the 300-and-some assaults that we've had this year, 127 have been committed by juveniles,\" he said.Todd brought up the juvenile justice reform bill, passed in 2022, which stops youth, under the age of 13, from facing criminal charges like assault and weapons violations.He said something needs to be done to fix this reform.\"And the juveniles know it,\" he said. \"We have 12-year-old kids telling us, 'What are you going to do to me?'\" With the juvenile curfew in Cambridge, which went into effect Oct. 1, Todd said the last thing he wants to do is fine a parent.\"But at the end of the day, if we can help one child or one family, one parent to better parent their child, and get them out of the streets, then we've done something right as a community and it's a start,\" he said about the curfew.In 2010, Todd said the department had 52 officers. When he entered the role of police chief, there were 29 total officers with two in the police academy.\"At that time, we had a department that was depleted,\" he said.The department is building itself back up. Todd said there are 39 total officers in the department right now, with four in the police academy.\"So we'll get those out of the police academy in December, and we'll keep building our Criminal Investigations Division,\" he said.Todd said he hopes to increase the diversity of the department. He said that 67.5% of both civilian employees and sworn officers in the department are white. Black employees make up 22.5%. Hispanic employees and Asian employees each make up 5%.\"We want to mirror our community,\" Todd said, acknowledging that this is no easy feat.\"But I just want the public to know we're working hard to get there,\" he added.After the meeting, Gary Gordy, one of the residents in attendance, said that he thinks more policing is needed in Cambridge and thinks it's good the department is hiring more officers. He said that when it comes to crime, Cambridge needs cameras.Gordy added that some of the problems the city is facing with crime could have been prevented if the city had acted earlier.\"We wait for years to get things done,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCapt.

The release stated the Caroline County Sheriff's Office is conducting a criminal investigation.\nThe discovery follows resident concerns about the smell and drinkability of the town's water. On Saturday, Greensboro's public works department contacted its water and wastewater contractor, Susquehanna Operational Services, to test chlorine levels.\nResident Jose Miranda said \"the smell is still really strong.\" He said there's no discoloration of the water, but that the chlorine smell is obvious.\nIn the release, the town stated that the chlorine levels were as high as 2.2 milligrams per liter over the weekend. Typical readings are around 0.56 milligrams per liter.\nThat mark dropped to 1.0 milligrams per liter on Monday, the town said. The Environmental Protection Agency's standard is that anything above the 4.0 milligram per level mark is not healthy to drink and could pose long-term health effects such as eye irritation and stomach problems.\nOn Sunday, a Facebook post by the town told residents the water is safe to drink and within Maryland Department of the Environment regulations. Multiple residents, though, commented that the chlorine-like smell and taste were still noticeable.\nOn July 19, the town issued a boil water notice, advising residents to boil water before drinking due to high chlorine levels.\nResident Chris Mason said the water quality issue has been recurring in the last few weeks. He said poor drinking water will especially effect those without refrigerator filters and mothers who need it for baby formula.\nTown Manager Tammy Kelledes said the town changed its locks to prevent further tampering with the regulators.\nResidents who would like their water tested can call 410-482-6222 or email greensboro@greensboromd.com. Anyone with information regarding the criminal investigation can call the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And rain. Driving rain that swamped yards and some streets.\nThe storm went on for hours. When it ended there seemed to be only minor damage \u2014 some downed tree limbs ... except for the Faith Chapel United Methodist Church near Trappe. A bolt of lightning hit the church and started a fire.\nTrappe firefighters quickly responded and doused the flames. The state fire marshal's office assessed the damage at $25,000, not as bad as it could have been but devastating for a small church.\nThe Rev. Gary Moore said the damage is \"very, very significant\" for the small church, which dates to the 1880s.\n\"I was there last night,\" Moore said in an interview with Star Democrat reporter Konner Metz Wednesday. \"Assessing the building will be a difficult decision as we move into the future.\"\nRead Konner's story below along with an incredible story about a juvenile kayaker who got lost over the weekend as darkness fell. He was found quickly by the Natural Resources Police who used a thermal imaging device to spot the kayak and lead firefighters to pull the young kayaker to safety.\nThat's a story that could have had a bad ending. Fortunately it did not.\n\u2014 Jim Johnson \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Hitting a deer can cause thousands of dollars worth of damage, bending front fenders, crumpling hoods and cracking front windshields.\n\"It is about 20% to 30% more this time of year,\" said TJ Jefferson of Grants Automotive in Easton. \"I get more calls early in the morning, 'Can you come get my car? I just struck a deer or a deer just struck me.'\"\nWith increased volume during deer season, he says they just get it done with the available manpower that they have.\nAccording to data from State Farm, \"U.S. drivers had an estimated 1.8 million animal collision insurance claims in the U.S. between July 2022 and June 2023.\"\nAbout 1.5 million deer-car accidents happen every year. More than $1 billion in annual insured losses are due to damages caused by deer-car accidents. According to State Farm, Maryland drivers have a one-in-116-vehicle likelihood risk for animal collisions. The highest risk state for deer-car collisions is West Virginia at one in 37 vehicles.\nDeer breeding season begins in October and runs through mid-December. During these months, bucks become more active, seeking out female deer. The females move around more to avoid the bucks. All this motion means more deer are on the roads.\nDeer are most active between the hours of 5 and 8 a.m. and again from 5 to 8 p.m., which are also hours that many drivers are on the road commuting to or from work.\nTrooper Ian Rola of the Easton Barracks of the Maryland State Police said, \"The incidents that rise this time of year are car accidents. (Deer) are in rut and are running all over and crossing the roadway. It is usually up this time of year \u2014 in the November time frame.\"\nRola and fellow law enforcement officers work to help keep roadways clear of hazards during these peak months.\n\"It is between law enforcement and SHA. We try to keep the roads clear. We rely on the public. If you see a carcass, give us a call, and we will come out. If it is a mess, we call SHA (State Highway Administration) to help,\" Rola said.\nRola emphasized the importance of drivers slowing down and wearing seat belts, especially as deer breeding season approaches.\n\"You have got to imagine, you hit a dear, you slam on the brakes and you are going forward at the same time. The seat belt will stop that forward momentum. This saves a lot of injuries from deer accidents,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from the State Highway Administration encouraged drivers to avoid making sudden turns or movements to avoid hitting deer.\n\"Making sudden, sharp turns is dangerous as it could place the driver in the path of oncoming traffic or cause your vehicle to strike a fixed object such as a tree or utility pole,\" wrote Charlie Gischlar of the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration in an email. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The threat followed an argument between the two men at a local restaurant earlier that evening.After leaving the restaurant with the rest of his family, the man said they walked to McWilliams' house and knocked on his door. The man told police McWilliams came to the door armed with a shotgun, pointed it at him and said that, if the man entered the home, he would shoot him.Police who spoke with McWilliams at the home said they could smell the odor of alcohol on his breath and on him. McWilliams told police that he left the restaurant after the argument and returned home. When he heard the man knock at the door, he armed himself with the shotgun and went downstairs to answer.McWilliams also told police he did not point the shotgun at the man and that he felt \"threatened\" by something the man said earlier in the evening.Police recovered the shotgun, identified as a Remington 870 20-gauge. The gun was found with one live shot shell in the chamber with the safety off, police wrote in charging documents.McWilliams appeared in the county district court Aug.7 for a bail review. He was ordered to remain held without bond.A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug.28. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When Saathoff arrived, he eventually found four trucks doused with gas \u2014 one of them significantly burnt.\n\"The seats were soaked, they had gas running out of the floor,\" Saathoff said. \"Then the very last one, we could tell when we open it, it had burned.\"\nDamages are estimated at $100,000, per the fire marshal. Saathoff said surveillance cameras show two actors \u2014 one driving a vehicle outside the fence and another person inside the business' fence where the trucks are parked, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office is actively investigating the arson attempt. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500.\nSunnySide Energy \u2014 which delivers bulk loads of fuel, retail and pool water \u2014 is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, Saathoff said.\nHe added that the damage to the trucks is a big financial dent.\n\"The loads that were lined up for the trucks, we have to get them back and you have lost revenue,\" Saathoff said. \"But we still got the same expenses.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the business fire officials say was targeted in an arson attempt.

    "content": "Video of presumed ICE arrest sparks confusion, fear in Cambridge\n\n June 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Immigrant communities are living in fear after arrests of immigrants have taken a new shape under the Trump administration.A Facebook video of unmarked vehicles with federal agents in bulletproof vests and ski masks arresting four men on Maryland Avenue off Route 50 in Cambridge has been circulating throughout the community.\n\"You know, it's definitely something we knew was coming, but we didn't know it was gonna be handled this way,\" said Julie Martinez, who recorded and uploaded the video to Facebook.\nResidents and commenters of the video believe these agents to be Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to The Star Democrat's request for details about the incident.\nSince President Donald Trump's inauguration, ICE raids have looked different. Washington, D.C., immigration attorney of over 25 years Matthew Famiglietti said the legal gray area has grown significantly due to rapid policy changes such as getting rid of safe spaces like churches, courts, hospitals and schools.\n\"Talking about what's legal and what's not legal, that's changed quite a bit since Trump,\" Famiglietti said.\nTrump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising to deliver the largest mass deportation in American history. ICE arrests have increased by 25% since he took office, according to the most recent ICE detention data.\nTo make this possible Trump signed five immigration-based executive orders on his first day, instated enforcement and structural changes within federal agencies like Customs and Border Control and ICE, conducted mass arrests including in safe spaces, and enacted travel bans from 12 countries, according to the White House's website.\nFamiglietti said ICE agents and the Department of Homeland Security are under no legal obligation to let local law enforcement agencies know of their actions.\nCambridge police Capt. Antoine Patton and Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips both said they were not aware of the arrests made on June 4.\nThe Cambridge Maryland Police Department's official Facebook made a post regarding the arrests saying, \"We have received several phone calls and inquiries regarding photos passed through social media showing subjects being detained/arrested within the city limits by law enforcement. The law enforcement in the pictures is not anyone associated with the Cambridge Police Department, and we have no knowledge of the incident(s) that took place.\"\nMartinez said around 7:15 a.m. June 4, four unmarked cars surrounded a work truck and began making what she called \"unclear\" announcements through a speaker while arresting the four individuals on Maryland Avenue.\n\"As you can see in the video, they didn't even give them time at all to even explain or say why you're getting pulled over,\" Martinez said. \"It was very quick, so when I saw it, my first thing was 'oh my gosh, there's no way this is happening.'\"\nFamiglietti said ICE agents do not have to show their faces or ride in marked cars, but they have to wear some sort of identifying detail. Martinez said the agents' bulletproof vests said \"Police,\" but that was the only identifying mark.\nMartinez said she immediately pulled out her phone and began recording. She said she's always recording because \"you never know what could happen, especially right now.\"\nThe video quickly caught traction, with 554 shares, 176 reactions and 135 comments on Facebook. The post made its way to the family members of the detained individuals, who, according to Martinez, were not aware of the arrests before the video.\nOut of the 135 comments on Martinez's post, multiple alluded to further ICE actions around Cambridge. However, those actions were not verified.\nFamiglietti said concerned residents and those looking for family members who may be detained should call their senators and representatives for information.\n\"That's the No. 1 thing,\" he said.\nOn June 14, demonstrations will be held across the nation on what protesters are calling \"No King Day\" in response to the administration's immigration policies and the actions of ICE agents. Protests are planned in Easton and Cambridge on that day, according to posts made on social media.\nMartinez said the immigrant community has to be especially careful right now.\n\"Drive at the speed limit. Do everything you're supposed to be doing,\" she said. \"You know we contribute to this country a lot, and unfortunately, we can't stay home. We can't do much but to keep going forward, but definitely stay more on the low.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As a caring and consistent adult, CASA volunteers attempt to identify the specific needs of each child, advocate in court and with agency partners for services to meet those needs and assist in seeking a permanent resolution for each child's life as quickly and safely as possible.Most importantly, the CASA gets to know their appointed children, often becoming one of the most consistent adults in children's lives.This is especially poignant during the holiday season, when all children need to know that someone cares and is looking out for them.For many children, the holidays are a time for building happy memories with family.However, holidays can be very difficult for children who have been removed from their homes and placed in foster care.Rather than enjoying the magic of the season, these children may be adjusting to new foster homes and transitioning to new schools. That can be a heavy burden, and CASA volunteers can help by being present for the children.CASA's involvement can lead to children's hope for a better tomorrow.Studies support the fact that children and youth with CASA volunteers have higher levels of hope than foster children who do not have CASA in their lives.Greater hope can lead to children being more likely to succeed in school, having greater self-control, increased optimism and a healthier sense of well-being.\"Speaking up for children is our proverbial North Star. It guides us in the certainty that a better future is a real possibility for each child we serve,\" said Robin Davenport, CASA's executive director. \"As we enter the holiday season, we are filled with gratitude for our CASA volunteers. Their compassionate dedication to vulnerable children is a treasure in our service region.\" CASA volunteers come from all walks of life, varied experiences and professions, and are at least 21 years of age. After completing the application and screening process, individuals participate in pre-service training before being sworn in as an officer of the court.CASA welcomes volunteers from all cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds.To learn more about becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate, visit casamidshore.org or email jc@casamidshore.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This means the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nIn an interview Monday, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the charges against Greene and Turner will be recharged in the Talbot County Circuit Court. Coale said this process is standard practice for more complex district court cases that move to the circuit court.\nAccording to Maryland Court records, the charges against both Greene and Turner have been filed in the circuit court.\nThe charges stem from an incident on Dec. 30 where deputies responded to a report of an attempted vehicle break-in in the 3800 block of Seymour Drive in Trappe. According to a Jan. 3 news release from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, deputies determined after further investigation that three men wearing all black clothing and masks attempted to enter multiple vehicles, stealing various items.\nPolice said the same day, deputies were dispatched to Harrison Circle in Trappe, where a resident noticed three men dressed in black clothing and wearing masks looking into vehicles.\nPolice said the three men barricaded themselves in a residence in the 3900 block of Main Street and after a short time, deputies were able to make contact with them. Police identified the three men as Greene, Turner and a 16-year-old boy, who was not named by the sheriff's office.\nIn January, the Sheriff's Office said the 16-year-old was charged with the same offenses as Turner and referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, where he was released to a guardian.\nThe Sheriff's Office said Greene attempted to resist arrest and assaulted a deputy as he was being detained.\nAccording to the news release, deputies found evidence during the investigation that also connected the three teens to vehicle break-ins that occurred in Easton earlier in 2024.\nAs of Monday afternoon, hearings or trials had yet to be set for Greene and Turner's circuit court cases. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An absolutely unneeded honking horn is startling and rather than achieving its likely objective of hurrying me along and making me drive in the manner in which you think I should be driving actually slows me down when I look once more to reassess the situation around me before I move away from that light or stop sign or turn against traffic.\nYou will be senior drivers someday yourself, and you will understand certain facts \u2014 namely your reaction time slows a touch, your hearing and vision, though adequate for the task, are not what they used to be and your trust in your own cognition in discerning what is happening around you is quite naturally slightly diminished.\nTalbot County and the town of Easton today present challenging driving conditions. The sheer volume of traffic, the narrow streets in town with double parking, and the plethora of large sized pickups and SUVs plying streets and roadways here that were not designed for these types of vehicles are factors, as well as the presence of some dangerous intersections lacking traffic controls \u2014 one of these is one I use daily, the intersection of the Parkway and Tristan Drive. I do not need an accident at my age, whether my fault or not. This is a major reason I (and many others of my age) need that extra moment of time to cope safely and competently with the driving situations already mentioned. And I can cope if I get just a minimum amount of cooperation from all of you others on the road.\nJOEL S.

    "content": "Easton police seek permits for future protests\n\n October 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 While police said Saturday's No Kings protest in Easton remained civil, they're asking the town to consider requiring public assembly permits for similar future protests.Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey raised the concern at a Town Council meeting Monday. He said Saturday's protest \u2014 during which hundreds lined sidewalks on Dover Road \u2014 was a challenge for police.\n\"As with any big event, my concern with police coverage is the unexpected, the person who does not appreciate that (protest),\" Lowrey said. \"We've seen it all across our country. It's a little frustrating when these events are not going through the public assembly event process, to allow us to plan.\"\nEaston's No Kings rally was just one of thousands nationwide, where people gathered in opposition of the Trump administration. Lowrey said one counter-protester remained civil, though police did get a call from a business concerned about people crowding parking lots.\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Phil Jackson said in an interview that the committee and the Talbot County Democratic Forum were in \"regular contact\" with the mayor and police in advance of Saturday's rally to ensure safety.\nAlso on Saturday in Easton, police and emergency officials held a mass casualty simulation, designed to train first responders in an active shooter scenario. The training ran from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Temple B'nai Israel and surrounding areas.\nLowrey said the Easton Police Department had a \"great deal of resources committed\" to that simulation. Combined with the large protest, the agency's patrol division was \"essentially wiped out.\"\n\"We were able to respond to a call here or there, but if something happened, at that point, it comes at the expense of all the other citizens in the town because we have no officers available to respond to other emergencies,\" he said.\nSaturday's No Kings protest didn't obtain a public assembly permit, nor did the first No Kings gathering in June. Lowrey said the town should look at rewording its public assembly permit rules to explicitly require such protests obtain a permit beforehand.\nThe police chief said the permits allow the department to adequately staff both the event and day-of calls or emergencies.\nAccording to town code, permits must be obtained for \"any open air public meeting, rally, conference, assembly or similar gathering upon any public property.\" The word \"protest\" is not included in the code.\nPermit applications cost $100, though some events require additional costs depending on the equipment and police officers needed. Permits are first reviewed by police and then either approved or denied by the Town Council. Rarely does the council reject a permit request after a positive police recommendation, though some requests in the past have garnered debate and slim majorities, such as the Delmarva Pride Festival.\nJackson noted that the No Kings Day protests are nationally coordinated and then organized at a local level in the days and weeks leading up. Local organizers, he said, are open to following any new or adjusted permit requirements brought by the town.\n\"We are very interested in ensuring that these events comply with local policy,\" Jackson said. \"Should the Town of Easton move forward with changes to their public gathering permits, we will look to comply with those and follow the process.\"\nLowrey added that Easton police typically provide as much coverage as possible for public assemblies at no cost by using on-duty officers. Feedback from Saturday, he said, was that officers were helpful. But he hopes the department can better prepare for future protests.\n\"But when you have 800 to 1,200 people lining streets and stuff, things can go wrong very quickly,\" he said. \"And that's always my biggest fear. It takes a car driving through 30 people, and we have a mass casualty, actually, incident, and not an exercise.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farmers, residents raise safety concerns regarding potential Route 662 closure\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 As site preparation is underway for a new regional medical center in Easton, many residents are concerned about the looming closure of Route 662, or Longwoods Road.The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new hospital is expected to begin construction in the spring of 2025. Since designs have a corner of the hospital sitting in the middle of existing Route 662, a section of the road is expected to be temporarily closed from Oct. 1 to May 1.\nGreg Gannon, a co-operator of family-owned grain farming operation C.H. Gannon & Sons on Longwoods Road, is not necessarily opposed to the closure. But Gannon said that the closure will \"represent an inconvenience at some level\" to not just the agricultural community, but everyone who uses the road.\n\"Moving large farm equipment and construction equipment these days is dangerous,\" Gannon said.\nInstead of using Route 662, many farmers may have to travel on nearby county-owned roads. Gannon noted the visibility is worse on those county roads compared to Route 662.\nShore Regional Health representatives have stated that delaying construction of the hospital until a new route is complete would present significant financial and time barriers to the project. Hospital construction is estimated to complete in the summer of 2028.\n\"The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health is committed to advancing the health of Mid-Shore residents and the new Regional Medical Center project is one of the most significant developments in the history of Talbot and its surrounding counties,\" Shore Regional said in a statement enailed to the Star Democrat. \"We recognize that building a state-of-the-art hospital to replace an aging and outdated facility may cause inconveniences and have worked tirelessly with state, county and city officials to ensure interruptions to daily activities are minimized. The necessary decision for a temporary closure of Route 662 was made in conjunction with the State Highway Administration, Talbot County officials and the Talbot County Sherriff's Office.\"\nNearly 70 residents wrote to the Talbot County Council in opposition of a bill that acts as a land transfer agreement between the county and Shore Regional, amending old legislation that required Shore Regional to build a new route before closing the current one.\nA request signed by 67 residents asked that the county stick with the original plan that dated back to 2013. Council members voted 4-1 to approve the bill at their most recent meeting, with Council Member Lynn Mielke the sole no vote.\nThe letter presented four main concerns: increased traffic on local county roads, potential backups if there's an emergency situation on U.S. Route 50, effects on farmers who use Route 662 for equipment and access to the Talbot County Community Center.\nWittman resident Mark Marshall, who signed the letter, uses the road to travel to and from work. He believes it'll be a detriment to safety for farmers and residents alike.\n\"It's going to put a hardship on a lot of people who basically depend on that road,\" Marshall said, \"especially on weekends with the traffic and everything going to and from Easton.\"\nAs part of the bill passed Tuesday, the transfer of the land from the county to Shore Regional Health is contingent upon the fulfillment of a road inspection and contribution agreement. That agreement requires Shore Regional Health to contribute to surrounding road work.\nSurrounding county roads \u2014 Hailem School Road, Hiners Lane, Airport Road and Goldsborough Neck Road \u2014 will all receive paving work this September, County Manager Clay Stamp said. Though that paving is unrelated to the potential Route 662 closure, Stamp said Shore Regional Health will be contributing financially to the effort.\nSince Route 662 is a state road, the Maryland State Highway Administration is responsible for approving its temporary closure and providing an official detour, which is expected to be U.S Route 50.\n\"SHA continues to work with all involved parties and will review the proposed detour plan to ensure it meets standards and provides for a safe alternate route,\" SHA wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat.\nWhile the bill approved by the county facilitates the transfer of the road from the county to Shore Regional Health, the Maryland Board of Public Works first must approve the transfer of the land from the state to the county.\nUpon successful transfers and State Highway Administration approval, the road may be partially closed for drivers come Oct. 1. Marshall, who drives Route 662 nearly every day and sees large farm equipment, is worried for the safety of the operators when that time arrives.\n\"If you have to go down (Route) 50, you're taking your life in your own hands,\" Marshall said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said she was stopped at the intersection's red light.\nThe woman told police that the tractor-trailer hit her rear bumper once, reversed and hit her car again and then struck her car for a third time, according to court records.\nThe court documents do not provide details of the events leading up to the incident.\nThe tractor-trailer driver, later identified as Dziergowski, continued driving when the light turned green and did not attempt to stop, the woman told police.\nEaston police wrote in charging documents that \"dispatch (had) received several calls in reference to the same tractor trailer driving all over the roadway.\"\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office and Cambridge Police Department stopped the tractor-trailer stopped on Route 50 in Cambridge.

    "content": "Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Department marks 100 years with parade Saturday\n\n July 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TILGHMAN ISLAND \u2014 It began in 1925 as a wagon with tanks, and now, the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Department is celebrating its centennial.Serving residents in the waterfront village, the fire department has persisted through many ups and downs, president Jesse Gottleib said.\n\"So many small companies don't see 100 years because of not only funding, but more so because of lack of participation, lack of volunteers for the department,\" he said.\nSuch challenges are true in Tilghman Island \u2014 there are around 30 volunteers, 12 of them firefighters, the president noted. And while money is always a challenge, Gottleib said the department is extremely active in hosting community fundraisers.\nThe key cog in the fire department's survival and success has been community support, said Gottleib and his mother Linda, the department's secretary.\n\"We would've never thought it,\" he said of reaching the 100-year mark. \"And I think the reason is because people in this side of St. Michaels down, they realize that we're gonna be there when they need it.\"\nTo celebrate the milestone, Tilghman Island firefighters are hosting a parade on Saturday. It begins at 10 a.m. with a fair atmosphere, including food, live music and games. At 11:30 a.m., kids will hop in fire gear to compete in a junior firefighters competition, spraying hoses at targets.\n\"It might help them to say, 'I wanna join,'\" Linda Gottleib said.\nThe parade begins near the Knapps Narrows Bridge at 1 p.m. A friendly firefighters' competition will follow, and later that evening, the department plans to host a private ceremony to honor some key life members.\nOn Wednesday at the fire house, the Gottleibs pointed out some of the unsung heroes of the fire department. Dewayne Stewart, a line officer for 36 years, and Billy Lednum, a line officer for 31 years, have been integral to the company's success.\n\"You'll see a hurt in the fire department when those two are gone,\" Jesse Gottleib said.\nThe Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Department doesn't go on a ton of calls \u2014 sometimes two to 10 per month, Gottleib said. But the department often provides mutual aid or helps with water rescues. Most recently, the Tilghman fire boat assisted state searchers with a rescue in Broad Creek on July 4.\nIn addition to the fire boat, the fire station houses multiple fire trucks and a Talbot County ambulance. Last year, the station donated a fire engine to a Tennessee fire department dealing with damages from Hurricane Helene.\nJesse Gottleib, 43, is the youngest sitting president and has been a member since he turned 16 in 1997. His mother joined in 1999 and has served a number of roles, including secretary, president and board member.\nIn recent days, they've been scouring through old newspaper clips and photos to create collages for Saturday's festivities. Some photos show the fire station in its three different buildings, the current one built in 2005.\nIt's a family affair for Jesse Gottleib, as it is for many of the volunteers. He recalled once ditching a baseball game \u2014 while actively manning left field \u2014 just to watch the fire trucks pull out of the station when he was about 9 years old.\n\"First game that we had down here at Tilghman school, the fire siren went off,\" he said. \"And (my mom) and my dad were standing there and were like, 'Is he leaving?' And I ran across the field to go to the fence.\"\nSaturday will be a chance to reflect on some of those fun memories, interact with the community and honor longtime volunteer firefighters and administrators. Gottleib said the dedication of volunteers has been remarkable.\n\"Their time is appreciated here,\" Gottleib said. \"I feel like they play a key role into getting us to where we are now at 100 years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Together they have donated fire and EMS equipment to first responders in need.When Hurricane Helene occurred, some of the members of the Oxford and Tilghman Fire Company felt the need to assist in any way possible. After watching several YouTube and Facebook videos circulating online showing the conditions in the affected areas, members of the fire company came up with the idea to assist first responders in Tennessee by donating some of their equipment.\nGraham Norbury, chief of the Oxford Fire Company, said regardless of location, fire departments seek to help each other and anyone else in need.\n\"We do a lot of mutual aid to other departments in the area and elsewhere,\" Norbury said. \"The Brotherhood of the Fire Services is pretty tight. When we see someone in need, then we want to be able to help any way we can.\"\nAccording to Norbury, most volunteer fire companies replace equipment on a reasonably regular basis. The Oxford Fire Department had several pieces of equipment delivered to them in a short amount of time including a new ambulance and a new fire truck.\nNorbury said they put word out through the Maryland State Firefighters Association that they wanted to help by donating equipment. News traveled fast, and Bill Killan, member from a fire department in Tennessee, contacted Norbury and helped coordinate a drop off with a fire department in Butler, Tennessee.\nTim Kearns, president of Oxford Fire Company, was one of the volunteers to deliver essential equipment to support disaster relief efforts. The drive to Tennessee was over 500 miles and was shared among four different drivers.\n\"It was important because the volunteer system works on mutual aid, so when someone is overwhelmed, we come to help,\" Kearns said. \"And that's what we did, only they're just a little farther away than most.\"\nKearns said they made two stops to deliver equipment. The first was at an agricultural supply in Bristol, Virginia, which is on the border of Tennessee.\nThere they offloaded a skid brush unit, which is a pre-assembled piece of equipment that can fit into the back of a pickup truck and turn that pickup truck into a brush truck for fighting land fires and small house fires.\nAccording to Kearns, the brush skid unit was the most valuable piece of equipment they gave because the roads in the area were so badly destroyed that any vehicle would have a difficult time navigating through.\nWith the brush skid unit the local fire department could use a heavy four-wheel drive pickup truck to help fight fires that occur.\nThe second stop was a campground called Faith Camp. Kearns said the camp was owned by Darren Clark, a member of the Elk Mills Poga Volunteer Fire Company, who had come from Florida to create the beautiful natural area.\nCurrently, Clark has been assisting people who have been displaced by the hurricane. Clark has designated his campground as a satellite fire station.\nAccording to Kearns, everyone is trying to do their part, regardless of location. Contributing Maryland fire companies include Oxford, Tilghman, Cordova, Easton, Queen Anne Hillsboro, Suddlersville and Hollywood.\n\"It took a lot of folks to coordinate and manhandle the transfer of this equipment, from the paperwork, insurances, transfer of titles and tags, to all of the logistics here, there and in between,\" Kearns said. \"Our Chief Engineer Stacy Dulin and Assistant Chief Engineers Mike Greenwak and Tom Bixler assured the equipment was capable of the 500-mile trip. Oxford Ferry loaned the heavy trailer.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The county's burn ban committee requested the council enact the 30-day ban.\n\"Their concern is that we have had abnormally dry conditions with no appreciable precipitation in the weather forecast,\" LeCates wrote.\nLeCates noted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \"currently classifying Talbot County as having abnormally dry conditions.\"\n\"Looking at our weather forecast, we do not show any significant precipitation in the near future,\" he wrote. \"The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Forest Service has listed our area as highly susceptible to fire due to these conditions.\"\nLast week, Dorchester and Wicomico counties each enacted burn bans due to drought-like conditions. On Oct. 22, Wicomico County voted to extend its burn ban.\nTalbot County most recently enacted a burn ban on July 21, which was placed due to similar dry conditions and a significant heat wave. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton officials weigh in on Complete Streets study, pedestrian safety\n\n October 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Town officials on Monday discussed ongoing efforts to shore up pedestrian and bike safety, including a comprehensive study on the town's roads and streets.In a workshop, Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh updated the Town Council on an ongoing study into street safety conducted by the engineering firm Wallace Montgomery.\nThe study, known as Complete Streets, aims to create a manual for Easton outlining which types of roads and streets prioritize certain modes of transportation, such as walking, biking and driving. The study itself will not make road safety improvements, though officials see it as a guide to initiating those upgrades.\nThose leading the study are in the process of meeting with local businesses and safety stakeholders to gather feedback on how best to define and classify different streets. Larry Marcus, an associate for Wallace Montgomery, said some classifications include residential, collector, commercial urban and commercial industrial streets.\nRoads are further defined by land use: downtown, residential, commercial and industrial, Marcus said. The categories roads fall into will determine the study's recommendation on which sidewalk, bike lane or vehicular improvements should be taken.\nVan Emburgh added that the manual will make it easier for the town to require certain road safety steps be taken when residential or commercial developers apply for site plan approval. Moving forward, the town will be less likely to give developers breaks or reliefs from ensuring private roads are up to town standards, he said.\n\"It's a very practical document that I can think of a lot of different ways it will be used,\" Van Emburgh said of the Complete Streets study. Guidelines will be drafted and applied to a map of town roads in November.\nDuring the nearly hourlong workshop, many specific pressure points in town were raised, including Port Street and North Washington Street.\nCouncil President Don Abbatiello said telephone poles in the middle of sidewalks on Port Street make it difficult for people to walk safely. Council members Maureen Curry and the Rev. Elmer Davis echoed the concern about the street.\n\"It's gonna (be) awfully difficult to make Port Street pedestrian friendly unless we make some serious improvements,\" Curry said.\nOn North Washington Street, sidewalks are expected to be added. Van Emburgh said the town has funds in its budget already for survey and design work for North Washington Street from Easton Hardware (near the Creamery Lane intersection) to Gay's Seafood (close to the stoplight at the Easton Parkway, or Route 322).\nThe Complete Streets guidance will help determine the specific bike, pedestrian and vehicular safety measures taken for the North Washington Street project.\nPedestrian and bike safety has been an ongoing discussion among town leaders, residents and local advocates. Earlier this month, worries about safety on Route 50 \u2014 a state-operated highway \u2014 were raised after a man on a bike was struck and killed.\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery shared concerns that the town would sacrifice the efficient flow of vehicular traffic in order to prioritize walking and biking. He said many of the older residents in his ward \u2014 including the west side of Easton Parkway \u2014 aren't \"interested in bicycling to downtown.\"\n\"Automobile transportation is pretty much what everybody uses in order to get into the center of town,\" Montgomery said. \"So I'm very concerned about our sacrificing the flow of single-occupancy vehicles, sacrificing it to other things, that for my ward, don't do any good at all by way of mobility.\"\nHeather Grant, executive director of Talbot Thrive, a local nonprofit that advocates for pedestrian and bike safety, refuted Montgomery's stance. In a statement, she said residents who \"don't want to drive everywhere\" deserve \"equal access to safe infrastructure.\"\n\"Some council members who mention the difficulties in traveling by car during school drop off and pick up should consider that if we make our streets safer for kids to walk and bike to school, we can reduce vehicle congestion,\" Grant wrote. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, when I got out of high school, I thought, 'I'll join Talbot County Corrections.'\n\"That way in corrections, it teaches you how to talk to people, interact with the people. Just because they got locked up and you see them in the jail, you realize they're not a bad person. They're just people like us.\"\nDyott, now 21, is looking forward to being an officer in Federalsburg. So far during his required 240 hours of field training, Dyott has enjoyed introducing himself to the community.\nDyott wants the community to know he will treat them with respect.\n\"I'm going to be fair, 100%,\" Dyott said. \"I believe in respect goes a long way. You respect me, I'm going to respect you anytime\u2026 No matter what, I'm going to be fair, and I'm going to try to step up on community policing.\"\nLt. Michelle Schuerholz said the police department is happy to have such a young officer on staff.\n\"We're proud to welcome Officer Dyott to our department,\" Schuerholz said. \"Being so young, he brings a strong commitment to community and public safety, and we're confident he will be a great asset to both our department and the residents we serve. We look forward to seeing the positive impact Officer Dyott will make in our community. He comes from correctional, and he had a good reputation there, and I think he'll do well here.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Multiple crashes at Easton intersection lead to resident concerns\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 630\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A recent string of crashes at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Aurora Street have ignited resident calls for traffic and safety improvements.Monday morning, residents Lydia Pinkney and Tony Ruffini stood on the sidewalk of Aurora Street, discussing their safety concerns for the residential area that is home to many families and children.\n\"You stand out here for about five, ten minutes, you'll see how fast people go,\" Ruffini said. \"It's insane. They don't care, and they're always in a hurry.\"\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, the intersection has seen three crashes this month, all due to driver error. There were only 13 in the last 11 years, police said.\nTown engineers reviewed the traffic light, which was confirmed as operational. In a Facebook post, the police department encouraged drivers to be cautious and stated the intersection will be monitored.\n\"While this location is being monitored, officers have begun targeted traffic enforcement and will continue to do so at different hours of the day,\" the department wrote.\nPinkney said she's worried for the safety of her 9-year-old daughter and her dog when walking up and down Aurora Street near the intersection. She says a car has careened into her yard before, and many neighbors have had their parked cars damaged.\nPinkney believes part of the issue is drivers may be unaware it is a residential area.\n\"The speed limit's 25, and I know people are going more than 25,\" she said. \"Our kids play out here. And what worries me about everything is if \u2026 someone's not paying attention or whatnot, them running the red light or just going way too fast and clipping me and my daughter.\"\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said the town is looking at what it can do with the intersection's traffic light in terms of safety and timing.\nEaston's engineers recently adjusted the timing of the intersection's traffic light, hoping to lower the \"chances of a collision if a driver attempts to beat a red light,\" the Easton Police Department announced Tuesday.\nDiscussion around safety on Brookletts Avenue has been recurring. This month, the town installed four-way stop signs at two other Brookletts intersections, South Harrison Street and Hanson Street. The intersections previously had two stop signs each.\nVan Emburgh said thus far, feedback on the four-way stop signs has been positive. Resident Lisa Stone lives next to the intersections and said she's happy with the change.\n\"I have seen so many near accidents at the intersections, particularly Hanson and Brookletts,\" Stone said. \" \u2026 I think that's a good improvement.\"\nThe town also added on-street parking lines to Brookletts Avenue, a measure that Van Emburgh said will improve safety on the wide, two-way street.\n\"The white lines give the drivers cues as to where they're supposed to be in the travel lanes,\" Van Emburgh said. \"Because one of the things that we struggle with is when you have a road that can accommodate on-street parking, but no one's actually parking on it, it looks like a wide-open raceway.\"\nFor many neighbors, traffic and safety concerns only grow as developers revamp a nearby property formerly owned by Perdue AgriBusiness. Last week, Easton's Planning Commission approved the majority of a 123-unit proposal for the site along Brookletts Avenue.\nDevelopers had Lenhart Traffic Consulting prepare a traffic impact study, which recommended project approval. Per Planning Commission documents, the study found redevelopment will have \"minimal impact on the surrounding road network.\"\nRuffini said with the new development and an eventual increase in traffic, South Aurora Street \"will be a main road before you know it.\"\nStone, meanwhile, is excited to see the redevelopment, given it includes commercial space and affordable housing. But she's keeping an eye on its impacts to driver and pedestrian safety.\n\"Hopefully it will just be an increase in traffic and not a decrease in safety,\" Stone said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The defense is vying for not-guilty verdicts on those counts, contending that second-degree murder or manslaughter are more appropriate charges.\nBradley and Britt, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been dating, according to multiple accounts provided during trial Tuesday and prior court documents. They were allegedly together in the parking lot of the park on Feb. 7, 2024, before Britt disappeared.\nEaston police put out a missing persons report for Britt six days later. Family had found her car abandoned in an Easton parking lot.\nCambridge police, along with state homicide detectives, assumed the investigation from Easton authorities following the review of cell phone location data placing Britt at the park.\nBradley was initially arrested on kidnapping charges in February 2024. Review of camera footage at the park from Feb. 7 revealed \"sounds of loud thuds ... consistent with forceful strikes,\" police wrote in charging documents. Later that night, footage showed a man \"carrying and dragging\" a woman's body to a vehicle, police wrote.\nBradley was indicted and arrested on murder charges in March 2024. Britt's body was not found.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, the lead prosecutor, and public defender Matt Connell, who is representing Bradley, provided opening statements Tuesday.\nLeonard told the jury the case is full of \"rage, control, domestic violence.\" Evidence shows Britt's relationship with Bradley was \"toxic,\" she said.\nLeonard said Bradley's former employer and a close friend will testify later this week. Bradley confided in them, she said, confessing to the murder and the disposing of Britt's body.\n\"She vanished,\" Leonard said. \"She was never seen or heard from again. No phone calls or text messages.\"\nLeonard said jurors will see video footage from the park. The audio is \"chilling,\" she said, showing Bradley drag Britt and throw her in the trunk of a car.\nBefore jurors took their seats to listen to openings, Connell objected to some of the audio evidence, arguing that Bradley could have a \"reasonable expectation\" for privacy during some of the conversations.\n\"We are fine acknowledging that that was him in the video,\" Connell said. \" ... 90% of the verbal communication occurred inside the vehicle.\"\nLeonard disagreed with the 90% assessment. Connell said, \"it's possible I'm mistaken.\"\nWhile the full video and accompanying audio wasn't admitted as evidence Tuesday, Judge William Jones sided with the prosecution. It's \"quite likely\" the court will allow its admission during trial, the judge said, especially if the conversations included yelling.\nIn Connell's opening statement, he acknowledged Bradley's involvement in Britt's death. But he said prosecutors must show Bradley intended to kill Britt in order for the jury to deliver a guilty verdict on first-degree murder.\n\"He lost it. He hit her too hard, and she died,\" Connell said, adding that Bradley tried to resuscitate Britt. \"He didn't mean to do it.\"\n\"Hold him responsible for what he's really guilty of, not above and beyond that,\" the defense attorney said.\nThirteen witnesses testified Tuesday, including close family of Britt and police detectives who worked the case.\nLinda Harris, Britt's mother, recalled Feb. 12, 2024 during an emotional testimony. It was her other daughter's birthday, and Britt didn't show up.\n\"She wouldn't miss anything,\" Harris said of birthday parties and holidays. The mother said she last saw Britt a week before she disappeared.\nTrial is scheduled to continue through Friday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In March of 2024, the town suspended the entirety of its police department amid a state investigation.\nOn July 25, 2024, an investigation report by the Office of the State Prosecutor found no \"sufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution.\" By that time, the Ridgely officers had already been laid off.\nMonday's decision came after a discussion at last month's commissioners meeting about three potential options to continue policing for the town.\n\"I know last month we talked about three options, one completely going back to the sheriff's department regular patrol pattern,\" Sears said. \"Second was to attempt to re-establish an original police force, and even that price was conservatively estimated at $852,000 for the first year if we could find the police officer.\"\nThe third option was to continue the MOU with the county.\nThe cost for the services of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office would be $493,415 on the fiscal year 2026 budget.\nThe Sheriff advocated for his office to continue its agreement with the town.\n\"The sheriff's office is providing what is going to be a high quality of law enforcement in the town,\" Caroline County Sheriff Donald Baker said in an interview. \"The town going with the MOU with the sheriff's office, they get everything the sheriff's office has to provide as far as criminal investigations handled by a investigator or detective, as well as the sheriff's office is a member of the Caroline County Drug Task Force and we have two deputies assigned to that.\"\nMultiple questions were brought up by town residents regarding where the $493,415 would go. Baker clarified to residents and commissioners how the funds would be broken down.\n\"There was some confusion that this money is dumped right into the Sheriff's Office budget. That's not true,\" Baker said. \"The county is billing the town based upon the usage. So, if we don't use something or there's money left over, the county does not bill it and it goes back to the town or the town keeps it and it's never filled.\"\nThe vote to continue the MOU was unanimous. Commissioner John Hurley was absent from the meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Antoine Patton and Lt. Greg McCray spoke at the town hall.Patton spoke about some of the things the department does to increase positive interactions with the community.\"If you look on the news, it would have you to believe sometimes that police officers are only there when bad things happen,\" he said. \"But we want our community to know that we love them, and we're here to work together.\" Patton mentioned how the department takes children and senior citizens Christmas shopping every year. This year, he said he had the idea for \"12 Days of Christmas\" where the department will take children and senior citizens out shopping from Dec. 12 through Dec. 24.Patton talked about a Thanksgiving dinner the department hosted last year and plans to host again this year.\"In five to 10 years these children will be teenagers and these teenagers will remember the things that we did,\" he said.Todd shared some of the city's crime data at the meeting as well.Since 2019, the Cambridge Police Department has taken 114 illegal guns off the streets, he said.Compared the the record number of seven homicides in Cambridge last year, Todd said there have been two homicides so far in 2023.\"I don't call that success by any means,\" he said. \"The day we have zero is the day we've been successful. [[---]] But it's progress. And that's what we have to keep banking on as we keep getting better as a community and a city.\" Todd said the number of juvenile crimes (committed by those under 18) is \"continuously getting worse.\" \"Out of the 300-and-some assaults that we've had this year, 127 have been committed by juveniles,\" he said.Todd brought up the juvenile justice reform bill, passed in 2022, which stops youth, under the age of 13, from facing criminal charges like assault and weapons violations.He said something needs to be done to fix this reform.\"And the juveniles know it,\" he said. \"We have 12-year-old kids telling us, 'What are you going to do to me?'\" With the juvenile curfew in Cambridge, which went into effect Oct. 1, Todd said the last thing he wants to do is fine a parent.\"But at the end of the day, if we can help one child or one family, one parent to better parent their child, and get them out of the streets, then we've done something right as a community and it's a start,\" he said about the curfew.In 2010, Todd said the department had 52 officers. When he entered the role of police chief, there were 29 total officers with two in the police academy.\"At that time, we had a department that was depleted,\" he said.The department is building itself back up. Todd said there are 39 total officers in the department right now, with four in the police academy.\"So we'll get those out of the police academy in December, and we'll keep building our Criminal Investigations Division,\" he said.Todd said he hopes to increase the diversity of the department. He said that 67.5% of both civilian employees and sworn officers in the department are white. Black employees make up 22.5%. Hispanic employees and Asian employees each make up 5%.\"We want to mirror our community,\" Todd said, acknowledging that this is no easy feat.\"But I just want the public to know we're working hard to get there,\" he added.After the meeting, Gary Gordy, one of the residents in attendance, said that he thinks more policing is needed in Cambridge and thinks it's good the department is hiring more officers. He said that when it comes to crime, Cambridge needs cameras.Gordy added that some of the problems the city is facing with crime could have been prevented if the city had acted earlier.\"We wait for years to get things done,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCapt.

The release stated the Caroline County Sheriff's Office is conducting a criminal investigation.\nThe discovery follows resident concerns about the smell and drinkability of the town's water. On Saturday, Greensboro's public works department contacted its water and wastewater contractor, Susquehanna Operational Services, to test chlorine levels.\nResident Jose Miranda said \"the smell is still really strong.\" He said there's no discoloration of the water, but that the chlorine smell is obvious.\nIn the release, the town stated that the chlorine levels were as high as 2.2 milligrams per liter over the weekend. Typical readings are around 0.56 milligrams per liter.\nThat mark dropped to 1.0 milligrams per liter on Monday, the town said. The Environmental Protection Agency's standard is that anything above the 4.0 milligram per level mark is not healthy to drink and could pose long-term health effects such as eye irritation and stomach problems.\nOn Sunday, a Facebook post by the town told residents the water is safe to drink and within Maryland Department of the Environment regulations. Multiple residents, though, commented that the chlorine-like smell and taste were still noticeable.\nOn July 19, the town issued a boil water notice, advising residents to boil water before drinking due to high chlorine levels.\nResident Chris Mason said the water quality issue has been recurring in the last few weeks. He said poor drinking water will especially effect those without refrigerator filters and mothers who need it for baby formula.\nTown Manager Tammy Kelledes said the town changed its locks to prevent further tampering with the regulators.\nResidents who would like their water tested can call 410-482-6222 or email greensboro@greensboromd.com. Anyone with information regarding the criminal investigation can call the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And rain. Driving rain that swamped yards and some streets.\nThe storm went on for hours. When it ended there seemed to be only minor damage \u2014 some downed tree limbs ... except for the Faith Chapel United Methodist Church near Trappe. A bolt of lightning hit the church and started a fire.\nTrappe firefighters quickly responded and doused the flames. The state fire marshal's office assessed the damage at $25,000, not as bad as it could have been but devastating for a small church.\nThe Rev. Gary Moore said the damage is \"very, very significant\" for the small church, which dates to the 1880s.\n\"I was there last night,\" Moore said in an interview with Star Democrat reporter Konner Metz Wednesday. \"Assessing the building will be a difficult decision as we move into the future.\"\nRead Konner's story below along with an incredible story about a juvenile kayaker who got lost over the weekend as darkness fell.

Hitting a deer can cause thousands of dollars worth of damage, bending front fenders, crumpling hoods and cracking front windshields.\n\"It is about 20% to 30% more this time of year,\" said TJ Jefferson of Grants Automotive in Easton. \"I get more calls early in the morning, 'Can you come get my car? I just struck a deer or a deer just struck me.'\"\nWith increased volume during deer season, he says they just get it done with the available manpower that they have.\nAccording to data from State Farm, \"U.S. drivers had an estimated 1.8 million animal collision insurance claims in the U.S. between July 2022 and June 2023.\"\nAbout 1.5 million deer-car accidents happen every year. More than $1 billion in annual insured losses are due to damages caused by deer-car accidents. According to State Farm, Maryland drivers have a one-in-116-vehicle likelihood risk for animal collisions. The highest risk state for deer-car collisions is West Virginia at one in 37 vehicles.\nDeer breeding season begins in October and runs through mid-December. During these months, bucks become more active, seeking out female deer. The females move around more to avoid the bucks. All this motion means more deer are on the roads.\nDeer are most active between the hours of 5 and 8 a.m. and again from 5 to 8 p.m., which are also hours that many drivers are on the road commuting to or from work.\nTrooper Ian Rola of the Easton Barracks of the Maryland State Police said, \"The incidents that rise this time of year are car accidents. (Deer) are in rut and are running all over and crossing the roadway. It is usually up this time of year \u2014 in the November time frame.\"\nRola and fellow law enforcement officers work to help keep roadways clear of hazards during these peak months.\n\"It is between law enforcement and SHA. We try to keep the roads clear. We rely on the public. If you see a carcass, give us a call, and we will come out. If it is a mess, we call SHA (State Highway Administration) to help,\" Rola said.\nRola emphasized the importance of drivers slowing down and wearing seat belts, especially as deer breeding season approaches.\n\"You have got to imagine, you hit a dear, you slam on the brakes and you are going forward at the same time. The seat belt will stop that forward momentum. This saves a lot of injuries from deer accidents,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from the State Highway Administration encouraged drivers to avoid making sudden turns or movements to avoid hitting deer.\n\"Making sudden, sharp turns is dangerous as it could place the driver in the path of oncoming traffic or cause your vehicle to strike a fixed object such as a tree or utility pole,\" wrote Charlie Gischlar of the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration in an email. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The threat followed an argument between the two men at a local restaurant earlier that evening.After leaving the restaurant with the rest of his family, the man said they walked to McWilliams' house and knocked on his door. The man told police McWilliams came to the door armed with a shotgun, pointed it at him and said that, if the man entered the home, he would shoot him.Police who spoke with McWilliams at the home said they could smell the odor of alcohol on his breath and on him. McWilliams told police that he left the restaurant after the argument and returned home. When he heard the man knock at the door, he armed himself with the shotgun and went downstairs to answer.McWilliams also told police he did not point the shotgun at the man and that he felt \"threatened\" by something the man said earlier in the evening.Police recovered the shotgun, identified as a Remington 870 20-gauge. The gun was found with one live shot shell in the chamber with the safety off, police wrote in charging documents.McWilliams appeared in the county district court Aug.7 for a bail review. He was ordered to remain held without bond.A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug.28. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When Saathoff arrived, he eventually found four trucks doused with gas \u2014 one of them significantly burnt.\n\"The seats were soaked, they had gas running out of the floor,\" Saathoff said. \"Then the very last one, we could tell when we open it, it had burned.\"\nDamages are estimated at $100,000, per the fire marshal. Saathoff said surveillance cameras show two actors \u2014 one driving a vehicle outside the fence and another person inside the business' fence where the trucks are parked, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office is actively investigating the arson attempt. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500.\nSunnySide Energy \u2014 which delivers bulk loads of fuel, retail and pool water \u2014 is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, Saathoff said.\nHe added that the damage to the trucks is a big financial dent.\n\"The loads that were lined up for the trucks, we have to get them back and you have lost revenue,\" Saathoff said. \"But we still got the same expenses.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the business fire officials say was targeted in an arson attempt.

    "content": "Video of presumed ICE arrest sparks confusion, fear in Cambridge\n\n June 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Immigrant communities are living in fear after arrests of immigrants have taken a new shape under the Trump administration.A Facebook video of unmarked vehicles with federal agents in bulletproof vests and ski masks arresting four men on Maryland Avenue off Route 50 in Cambridge has been circulating throughout the community.\n\"You know, it's definitely something we knew was coming, but we didn't know it was gonna be handled this way,\" said Julie Martinez, who recorded and uploaded the video to Facebook.\nResidents and commenters of the video believe these agents to be Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to The Star Democrat's request for details about the incident.\nSince President Donald Trump's inauguration, ICE raids have looked different. Washington, D.C., immigration attorney of over 25 years Matthew Famiglietti said the legal gray area has grown significantly due to rapid policy changes such as getting rid of safe spaces like churches, courts, hospitals and schools.\n\"Talking about what's legal and what's not legal, that's changed quite a bit since Trump,\" Famiglietti said.\nTrump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising to deliver the largest mass deportation in American history. ICE arrests have increased by 25% since he took office, according to the most recent ICE detention data.\nTo make this possible Trump signed five immigration-based executive orders on his first day, instated enforcement and structural changes within federal agencies like Customs and Border Control and ICE, conducted mass arrests including in safe spaces, and enacted travel bans from 12 countries, according to the White House's website.\nFamiglietti said ICE agents and the Department of Homeland Security are under no legal obligation to let local law enforcement agencies know of their actions.\nCambridge police Capt. Antoine Patton and Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips both said they were not aware of the arrests made on June 4.\nThe Cambridge Maryland Police Department's official Facebook made a post regarding the arrests saying, \"We have received several phone calls and inquiries regarding photos passed through social media showing subjects being detained/arrested within the city limits by law enforcement. The law enforcement in the pictures is not anyone associated with the Cambridge Police Department, and we have no knowledge of the incident(s) that took place.\"\nMartinez said around 7:15 a.m. June 4, four unmarked cars surrounded a work truck and began making what she called \"unclear\" announcements through a speaker while arresting the four individuals on Maryland Avenue.\n\"As you can see in the video, they didn't even give them time at all to even explain or say why you're getting pulled over,\" Martinez said. \"It was very quick, so when I saw it, my first thing was 'oh my gosh, there's no way this is happening.'\"\nFamiglietti said ICE agents do not have to show their faces or ride in marked cars, but they have to wear some sort of identifying detail. Martinez said the agents' bulletproof vests said \"Police,\" but that was the only identifying mark.\nMartinez said she immediately pulled out her phone and began recording. She said she's always recording because \"you never know what could happen, especially right now.\"\nThe video quickly caught traction, with 554 shares, 176 reactions and 135 comments on Facebook. The post made its way to the family members of the detained individuals, who, according to Martinez, were not aware of the arrests before the video.\nOut of the 135 comments on Martinez's post, multiple alluded to further ICE actions around Cambridge. However, those actions were not verified.\nFamiglietti said concerned residents and those looking for family members who may be detained should call their senators and representatives for information.\n\"That's the No. 1 thing,\" he said.\nOn June 14, demonstrations will be held across the nation on what protesters are calling \"No King Day\" in response to the administration's immigration policies and the actions of ICE agents. Protests are planned in Easton and Cambridge on that day, according to posts made on social media.\nMartinez said the immigrant community has to be especially careful right now.\n\"Drive at the speed limit. Do everything you're supposed to be doing,\" she said. \"You know we contribute to this country a lot, and unfortunately, we can't stay home. We can't do much but to keep going forward, but definitely stay more on the low.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As a caring and consistent adult, CASA volunteers attempt to identify the specific needs of each child, advocate in court and with agency partners for services to meet those needs and assist in seeking a permanent resolution for each child's life as quickly and safely as possible.Most importantly, the CASA gets to know their appointed children, often becoming one of the most consistent adults in children's lives.This is especially poignant during the holiday season, when all children need to know that someone cares and is looking out for them.For many children, the holidays are a time for building happy memories with family.However, holidays can be very difficult for children who have been removed from their homes and placed in foster care.Rather than enjoying the magic of the season, these children may be adjusting to new foster homes and transitioning to new schools. That can be a heavy burden, and CASA volunteers can help by being present for the children.CASA's involvement can lead to children's hope for a better tomorrow.Studies support the fact that children and youth with CASA volunteers have higher levels of hope than foster children who do not have CASA in their lives.Greater hope can lead to children being more likely to succeed in school, having greater self-control, increased optimism and a healthier sense of well-being.\"Speaking up for children is our proverbial North Star. It guides us in the certainty that a better future is a real possibility for each child we serve,\" said Robin Davenport, CASA's executive director. \"As we enter the holiday season, we are filled with gratitude for our CASA volunteers. Their compassionate dedication to vulnerable children is a treasure in our service region.\" CASA volunteers come from all walks of life, varied experiences and professions, and are at least 21 years of age. After completing the application and screening process, individuals participate in pre-service training before being sworn in as an officer of the court.CASA welcomes volunteers from all cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds.To learn more about becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate, visit casamidshore.org or email jc@casamidshore.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This means the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nIn an interview Monday, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the charges against Greene and Turner will be recharged in the Talbot County Circuit Court. Coale said this process is standard practice for more complex district court cases that move to the circuit court.\nAccording to Maryland Court records, the charges against both Greene and Turner have been filed in the circuit court.\nThe charges stem from an incident on Dec. 30 where deputies responded to a report of an attempted vehicle break-in in the 3800 block of Seymour Drive in Trappe. According to a Jan. 3 news release from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, deputies determined after further investigation that three men wearing all black clothing and masks attempted to enter multiple vehicles, stealing various items.\nPolice said the same day, deputies were dispatched to Harrison Circle in Trappe, where a resident noticed three men dressed in black clothing and wearing masks looking into vehicles.\nPolice said the three men barricaded themselves in a residence in the 3900 block of Main Street and after a short time, deputies were able to make contact with them. Police identified the three men as Greene, Turner and a 16-year-old boy, who was not named by the sheriff's office.\nIn January, the Sheriff's Office said the 16-year-old was charged with the same offenses as Turner and referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, where he was released to a guardian.\nThe Sheriff's Office said Greene attempted to resist arrest and assaulted a deputy as he was being detained.\nAccording to the news release, deputies found evidence during the investigation that also connected the three teens to vehicle break-ins that occurred in Easton earlier in 2024.\nAs of Monday afternoon, hearings or trials had yet to be set for Greene and Turner's circuit court cases. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An absolutely unneeded honking horn is startling and rather than achieving its likely objective of hurrying me along and making me drive in the manner in which you think I should be driving actually slows me down when I look once more to reassess the situation around me before I move away from that light or stop sign or turn against traffic.\nYou will be senior drivers someday yourself, and you will understand certain facts \u2014 namely your reaction time slows a touch, your hearing and vision, though adequate for the task, are not what they used to be and your trust in your own cognition in discerning what is happening around you is quite naturally slightly diminished.\nTalbot County and the town of Easton today present challenging driving conditions. The sheer volume of traffic, the narrow streets in town with double parking, and the plethora of large sized pickups and SUVs plying streets and roadways here that were not designed for these types of vehicles are factors, as well as the presence of some dangerous intersections lacking traffic controls \u2014 one of these is one I use daily, the intersection of the Parkway and Tristan Drive. I do not need an accident at my age, whether my fault or not. This is a major reason I (and many others of my age) need that extra moment of time to cope safely and competently with the driving situations already mentioned. And I can cope if I get just a minimum amount of cooperation from all of you others on the road.\nJOEL S.

He said Saturday's protest \u2014 during which hundreds lined sidewalks on Dover Road \u2014 was a challenge for police.\n\"As with any big event, my concern with police coverage is the unexpected, the person who does not appreciate that (protest),\" Lowrey said. \"We've seen it all across our country. It's a little frustrating when these events are not going through the public assembly event process, to allow us to plan.\"\nEaston's No Kings rally was just one of thousands nationwide, where people gathered in opposition of the Trump administration. Lowrey said one counter-protester remained civil, though police did get a call from a business concerned about people crowding parking lots.\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Phil Jackson said in an interview that the committee and the Talbot County Democratic Forum were in \"regular contact\" with the mayor and police in advance of Saturday's rally to ensure safety.\nAlso on Saturday in Easton, police and emergency officials held a mass casualty simulation, designed to train first responders in an active shooter scenario. The training ran from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Temple B'nai Israel and surrounding areas.\nLowrey said the Easton Police Department had a \"great deal of resources committed\" to that simulation. Combined with the large protest, the agency's patrol division was \"essentially wiped out.\"\n\"We were able to respond to a call here or there, but if something happened, at that point, it comes at the expense of all the other citizens in the town because we have no officers available to respond to other emergencies,\" he said.\nSaturday's No Kings protest didn't obtain a public assembly permit, nor did the first No Kings gathering in June. Lowrey said the town should look at rewording its public assembly permit rules to explicitly require such protests obtain a permit beforehand.\nThe police chief said the permits allow the department to adequately staff both the event and day-of calls or emergencies.\nAccording to town code, permits must be obtained for \"any open air public meeting, rally, conference, assembly or similar gathering upon any public property.\" The word \"protest\" is not included in the code.\nPermit applications cost $100, though some events require additional costs depending on the equipment and police officers needed. Permits are first reviewed by police and then either approved or denied by the Town Council. Rarely does the council reject a permit request after a positive police recommendation, though some requests in the past have garnered debate and slim majorities, such as the Delmarva Pride Festival.\nJackson noted that the No Kings Day protests are nationally coordinated and then organized at a local level in the days and weeks leading up. Local organizers, he said, are open to following any new or adjusted permit requirements brought by the town.\n\"We are very interested in ensuring that these events comply with local policy,\" Jackson said. \"Should the Town of Easton move forward with changes to their public gathering permits, we will look to comply with those and follow the process.\"\nLowrey added that Easton police typically provide as much coverage as possible for public assemblies at no cost by using on-duty officers. Feedback from Saturday, he said, was that officers were helpful. But he hopes the department can better prepare for future protests.\n\"But when you have 800 to 1,200 people lining streets and stuff, things can go wrong very quickly,\" he said. \"And that's always my biggest fear. It takes a car driving through 30 people, and we have a mass casualty, actually, incident, and not an exercise.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farmers, residents raise safety concerns regarding potential Route 662 closure\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 As site preparation is underway for a new regional medical center in Easton, many residents are concerned about the looming closure of Route 662, or Longwoods Road.The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new hospital is expected to begin construction in the spring of 2025. Since designs have a corner of the hospital sitting in the middle of existing Route 662, a section of the road is expected to be temporarily closed from Oct. 1 to May 1.\nGreg Gannon, a co-operator of family-owned grain farming operation C.H. Gannon & Sons on Longwoods Road, is not necessarily opposed to the closure. But Gannon said that the closure will \"represent an inconvenience at some level\" to not just the agricultural community, but everyone who uses the road.\n\"Moving large farm equipment and construction equipment these days is dangerous,\" Gannon said.\nInstead of using Route 662, many farmers may have to travel on nearby county-owned roads. Gannon noted the visibility is worse on those county roads compared to Route 662.\nShore Regional Health representatives have stated that delaying construction of the hospital until a new route is complete would present significant financial and time barriers to the project. Hospital construction is estimated to complete in the summer of 2028.\n\"The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health is committed to advancing the health of Mid-Shore residents and the new Regional Medical Center project is one of the most significant developments in the history of Talbot and its surrounding counties,\" Shore Regional said in a statement enailed to the Star Democrat. \"We recognize that building a state-of-the-art hospital to replace an aging and outdated facility may cause inconveniences and have worked tirelessly with state, county and city officials to ensure interruptions to daily activities are minimized. The necessary decision for a temporary closure of Route 662 was made in conjunction with the State Highway Administration, Talbot County officials and the Talbot County Sherriff's Office.\"\nNearly 70 residents wrote to the Talbot County Council in opposition of a bill that acts as a land transfer agreement between the county and Shore Regional, amending old legislation that required Shore Regional to build a new route before closing the current one.\nA request signed by 67 residents asked that the county stick with the original plan that dated back to 2013. Council members voted 4-1 to approve the bill at their most recent meeting, with Council Member Lynn Mielke the sole no vote.\nThe letter presented four main concerns: increased traffic on local county roads, potential backups if there's an emergency situation on U.S. Route 50, effects on farmers who use Route 662 for equipment and access to the Talbot County Community Center.\nWittman resident Mark Marshall, who signed the letter, uses the road to travel to and from work. He believes it'll be a detriment to safety for farmers and residents alike.\n\"It's going to put a hardship on a lot of people who basically depend on that road,\" Marshall said, \"especially on weekends with the traffic and everything going to and from Easton.\"\nAs part of the bill passed Tuesday, the transfer of the land from the county to Shore Regional Health is contingent upon the fulfillment of a road inspection and contribution agreement. That agreement requires Shore Regional Health to contribute to surrounding road work.\nSurrounding county roads \u2014 Hailem School Road, Hiners Lane, Airport Road and Goldsborough Neck Road \u2014 will all receive paving work this September, County Manager Clay Stamp said. Though that paving is unrelated to the potential Route 662 closure, Stamp said Shore Regional Health will be contributing financially to the effort.\nSince Route 662 is a state road, the Maryland State Highway Administration is responsible for approving its temporary closure and providing an official detour, which is expected to be U.S Route 50.\n\"SHA continues to work with all involved parties and will review the proposed detour plan to ensure it meets standards and provides for a safe alternate route,\" SHA wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat.\nWhile the bill approved by the county facilitates the transfer of the road from the county to Shore Regional Health, the Maryland Board of Public Works first must approve the transfer of the land from the state to the county.\nUpon successful transfers and State Highway Administration approval, the road may be partially closed for drivers come Oct. 1. Marshall, who drives Route 662 nearly every day and sees large farm equipment, is worried for the safety of the operators when that time arrives.\n\"If you have to go down (Route) 50, you're taking your life in your own hands,\" Marshall said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said she was stopped at the intersection's red light.\nThe woman told police that the tractor-trailer hit her rear bumper once, reversed and hit her car again and then struck her car for a third time, according to court records.\nThe court documents do not provide details of the events leading up to the incident.\nThe tractor-trailer driver, later identified as Dziergowski, continued driving when the light turned green and did not attempt to stop, the woman told police.\nEaston police wrote in charging documents that \"dispatch (had) received several calls in reference to the same tractor trailer driving all over the roadway.\"\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office and Cambridge Police Department stopped the tractor-trailer stopped on Route 50 in Cambridge. Easton police arrived on scene and arrested Dziergowski around 8:30 a.m.\nDziergowski was released on his own recognizance Thursday.

And while money is always a challenge, Gottleib said the department is extremely active in hosting community fundraisers.\nThe key cog in the fire department's survival and success has been community support, said Gottleib and his mother Linda, the department's secretary.\n\"We would've never thought it,\" he said of reaching the 100-year mark. \"And I think the reason is because people in this side of St. Michaels down, they realize that we're gonna be there when they need it.\"\nTo celebrate the milestone, Tilghman Island firefighters are hosting a parade on Saturday. It begins at 10 a.m. with a fair atmosphere, including food, live music and games. At 11:30 a.m., kids will hop in fire gear to compete in a junior firefighters competition, spraying hoses at targets.\n\"It might help them to say, 'I wanna join,'\" Linda Gottleib said.\nThe parade begins near the Knapps Narrows Bridge at 1 p.m. A friendly firefighters' competition will follow, and later that evening, the department plans to host a private ceremony to honor some key life members.\nOn Wednesday at the fire house, the Gottleibs pointed out some of the unsung heroes of the fire department. Dewayne Stewart, a line officer for 36 years, and Billy Lednum, a line officer for 31 years, have been integral to the company's success.\n\"You'll see a hurt in the fire department when those two are gone,\" Jesse Gottleib said.\nThe Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Department doesn't go on a ton of calls \u2014 sometimes two to 10 per month, Gottleib said. But the department often provides mutual aid or helps with water rescues. Most recently, the Tilghman fire boat assisted state searchers with a rescue in Broad Creek on July 4.\nIn addition to the fire boat, the fire station houses multiple fire trucks and a Talbot County ambulance. Last year, the station donated a fire engine to a Tennessee fire department dealing with damages from Hurricane Helene.\nJesse Gottleib, 43, is the youngest sitting president and has been a member since he turned 16 in 1997. His mother joined in 1999 and has served a number of roles, including secretary, president and board member.\nIn recent days, they've been scouring through old newspaper clips and photos to create collages for Saturday's festivities. Some photos show the fire station in its three different buildings, the current one built in 2005.\nIt's a family affair for Jesse Gottleib, as it is for many of the volunteers. He recalled once ditching a baseball game \u2014 while actively manning left field \u2014 just to watch the fire trucks pull out of the station when he was about 9 years old.\n\"First game that we had down here at Tilghman school, the fire siren went off,\" he said. \"And (my mom) and my dad were standing there and were like, 'Is he leaving?' And I ran across the field to go to the fence.\"\nSaturday will be a chance to reflect on some of those fun memories, interact with the community and honor longtime volunteer firefighters and administrators. Gottleib said the dedication of volunteers has been remarkable.\n\"Their time is appreciated here,\" Gottleib said. \"I feel like they play a key role into getting us to where we are now at 100 years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Together they have donated fire and EMS equipment to first responders in need.When Hurricane Helene occurred, some of the members of the Oxford and Tilghman Fire Company felt the need to assist in any way possible. After watching several YouTube and Facebook videos circulating online showing the conditions in the affected areas, members of the fire company came up with the idea to assist first responders in Tennessee by donating some of their equipment.\nGraham Norbury, chief of the Oxford Fire Company, said regardless of location, fire departments seek to help each other and anyone else in need.\n\"We do a lot of mutual aid to other departments in the area and elsewhere,\" Norbury said. \"The Brotherhood of the Fire Services is pretty tight. When we see someone in need, then we want to be able to help any way we can.\"\nAccording to Norbury, most volunteer fire companies replace equipment on a reasonably regular basis. The Oxford Fire Department had several pieces of equipment delivered to them in a short amount of time including a new ambulance and a new fire truck.\nNorbury said they put word out through the Maryland State Firefighters Association that they wanted to help by donating equipment. News traveled fast, and Bill Killan, member from a fire department in Tennessee, contacted Norbury and helped coordinate a drop off with a fire department in Butler, Tennessee.\nTim Kearns, president of Oxford Fire Company, was one of the volunteers to deliver essential equipment to support disaster relief efforts. The drive to Tennessee was over 500 miles and was shared among four different drivers.\n\"It was important because the volunteer system works on mutual aid, so when someone is overwhelmed, we come to help,\" Kearns said. \"And that's what we did, only they're just a little farther away than most.\"\nKearns said they made two stops to deliver equipment. The first was at an agricultural supply in Bristol, Virginia, which is on the border of Tennessee.\nThere they offloaded a skid brush unit, which is a pre-assembled piece of equipment that can fit into the back of a pickup truck and turn that pickup truck into a brush truck for fighting land fires and small house fires.\nAccording to Kearns, the brush skid unit was the most valuable piece of equipment they gave because the roads in the area were so badly destroyed that any vehicle would have a difficult time navigating through.\nWith the brush skid unit the local fire department could use a heavy four-wheel drive pickup truck to help fight fires that occur.\nThe second stop was a campground called Faith Camp. Kearns said the camp was owned by Darren Clark, a member of the Elk Mills Poga Volunteer Fire Company, who had come from Florida to create the beautiful natural area.\nCurrently, Clark has been assisting people who have been displaced by the hurricane. Clark has designated his campground as a satellite fire station.\nAccording to Kearns, everyone is trying to do their part, regardless of location. Contributing Maryland fire companies include Oxford, Tilghman, Cordova, Easton, Queen Anne Hillsboro, Suddlersville and Hollywood.\n\"It took a lot of folks to coordinate and manhandle the transfer of this equipment, from the paperwork, insurances, transfer of titles and tags, to all of the logistics here, there and in between,\" Kearns said. \"Our Chief Engineer Stacy Dulin and Assistant Chief Engineers Mike Greenwak and Tom Bixler assured the equipment was capable of the 500-mile trip. Oxford Ferry loaned the heavy trailer.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The county's burn ban committee requested the council enact the 30-day ban.\n\"Their concern is that we have had abnormally dry conditions with no appreciable precipitation in the weather forecast,\" LeCates wrote.\nLeCates noted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \"currently classifying Talbot County as having abnormally dry conditions.\"\n\"Looking at our weather forecast, we do not show any significant precipitation in the near future,\" he wrote. \"The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Forest Service has listed our area as highly susceptible to fire due to these conditions.\"\nLast week, Dorchester and Wicomico counties each enacted burn bans due to drought-like conditions. On Oct. 22, Wicomico County voted to extend its burn ban.\nTalbot County most recently enacted a burn ban on July 21, which was placed due to similar dry conditions and a significant heat wave. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton officials weigh in on Complete Streets study, pedestrian safety\n\n October 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Town officials on Monday discussed ongoing efforts to shore up pedestrian and bike safety, including a comprehensive study on the town's roads and streets.In a workshop, Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh updated the Town Council on an ongoing study into street safety conducted by the engineering firm Wallace Montgomery.\nThe study, known as Complete Streets, aims to create a manual for Easton outlining which types of roads and streets prioritize certain modes of transportation, such as walking, biking and driving. The study itself will not make road safety improvements, though officials see it as a guide to initiating those upgrades.\nThose leading the study are in the process of meeting with local businesses and safety stakeholders to gather feedback on how best to define and classify different streets. Larry Marcus, an associate for Wallace Montgomery, said some classifications include residential, collector, commercial urban and commercial industrial streets.\nRoads are further defined by land use: downtown, residential, commercial and industrial, Marcus said. The categories roads fall into will determine the study's recommendation on which sidewalk, bike lane or vehicular improvements should be taken.\nVan Emburgh added that the manual will make it easier for the town to require certain road safety steps be taken when residential or commercial developers apply for site plan approval. Moving forward, the town will be less likely to give developers breaks or reliefs from ensuring private roads are up to town standards, he said.\n\"It's a very practical document that I can think of a lot of different ways it will be used,\" Van Emburgh said of the Complete Streets study. Guidelines will be drafted and applied to a map of town roads in November.\nDuring the nearly hourlong workshop, many specific pressure points in town were raised, including Port Street and North Washington Street.\nCouncil President Don Abbatiello said telephone poles in the middle of sidewalks on Port Street make it difficult for people to walk safely. Council members Maureen Curry and the Rev. Elmer Davis echoed the concern about the street.\n\"It's gonna (be) awfully difficult to make Port Street pedestrian friendly unless we make some serious improvements,\" Curry said.\nOn North Washington Street, sidewalks are expected to be added. Van Emburgh said the town has funds in its budget already for survey and design work for North Washington Street from Easton Hardware (near the Creamery Lane intersection) to Gay's Seafood (close to the stoplight at the Easton Parkway, or Route 322).\nThe Complete Streets guidance will help determine the specific bike, pedestrian and vehicular safety measures taken for the North Washington Street project.\nPedestrian and bike safety has been an ongoing discussion among town leaders, residents and local advocates. Earlier this month, worries about safety on Route 50 \u2014 a state-operated highway \u2014 were raised after a man on a bike was struck and killed.\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery shared concerns that the town would sacrifice the efficient flow of vehicular traffic in order to prioritize walking and biking. He said many of the older residents in his ward \u2014 including the west side of Easton Parkway \u2014 aren't \"interested in bicycling to downtown.\"\n\"Automobile transportation is pretty much what everybody uses in order to get into the center of town,\" Montgomery said. \"So I'm very concerned about our sacrificing the flow of single-occupancy vehicles, sacrificing it to other things, that for my ward, don't do any good at all by way of mobility.\"\nHeather Grant, executive director of Talbot Thrive, a local nonprofit that advocates for pedestrian and bike safety, refuted Montgomery's stance. In a statement, she said residents who \"don't want to drive everywhere\" deserve \"equal access to safe infrastructure.\"\n\"Some council members who mention the difficulties in traveling by car during school drop off and pick up should consider that if we make our streets safer for kids to walk and bike to school, we can reduce vehicle congestion,\" Grant wrote. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, when I got out of high school, I thought, 'I'll join Talbot County Corrections.'\n\"That way in corrections, it teaches you how to talk to people, interact with the people. Just because they got locked up and you see them in the jail, you realize they're not a bad person. They're just people like us.\"\nDyott, now 21, is looking forward to being an officer in Federalsburg. So far during his required 240 hours of field training, Dyott has enjoyed introducing himself to the community.\nDyott wants the community to know he will treat them with respect.\n\"I'm going to be fair, 100%,\" Dyott said. \"I believe in respect goes a long way. You respect me, I'm going to respect you anytime\u2026 No matter what, I'm going to be fair, and I'm going to try to step up on community policing.\"\nLt. Michelle Schuerholz said the police department is happy to have such a young officer on staff.\n\"We're proud to welcome Officer Dyott to our department,\" Schuerholz said. \"Being so young, he brings a strong commitment to community and public safety, and we're confident he will be a great asset to both our department and the residents we serve. We look forward to seeing the positive impact Officer Dyott will make in our community. He comes from correctional, and he had a good reputation there, and I think he'll do well here.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was the most serious charge that Persina was charged with and the maximum penalty for the offense is three years in jail and a $5,000 fine.\nPersina was also sentenced to five years of supervised probation, ordered to have a mental health evaluation and complete any recommended treatment, to abstain from alcohol and drugs, to get an alcohol evaluation and complete any recommended treatment.\nPersina pleaded guilty by way of an Alford guilty plea, by not admitting guilt but by acknowledging that the state had sufficient evidence that she could be found guilty of the charge.\nThe case was prosecuted by Lance G. Richardson, state's attorney for Queen Anne's County, assisted by Carolynn Grammas, assistant state's attorney from Anne Arundel County, appointed as a special prosecutor for the case.\nThe state said the sentence fell within the recommended sentence range as calculated by the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines, which recommended a sentence ranging from six months to three years of active incarceration.\nPersina's conviction was based on a Jan. 27, 2024, incident when at approximately 7:46 a.m. she was operating a Honda Civic passenger vehicle at a high rate of speed in heavy fog traveling westbound on the Bay Bridge on the Queen Anne's County portion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Persina rear-ended another vehicle, which disabled her vehicle in the travel portion of the bridge, resulting in a 23-vehicle chain reaction collision.\nThe collision resulted in a victim having his arm severed from his body. The man's arm was unable to be reattached. Persina suffered serious injuries in the collision and was transported to the hospital.\nThrough the course of their investigation, police determined at the time of the collision, Persina's blood alcohol content was between 0.24 and 0.27 \u2014 three times greater than the legal limit.\nAlthough the accident occurred on Jan. 27, 2024, Persina wasn't criminally charged until August 2024. The state reported the delay in formally charging Persina was due to the incredible amount of vehicle data that had to be reviewed for the more than 20 vehicles involved.\nAccording to State's Attorney Lance Richardson's chief of staff, Rob Penny, medical records had to be obtained and then the large volume of records had to be reviewed.\nAdditionally, a large volume of other evidence, and information from witnesses, had to be reviewed and analyzed. All of this investigative information took months to be collected and examined, Penny said.\nOnce Persina was formally charged, she was arrested and held without bail. Her attorneys ultimately filed a notice of incompetency to stand trial due to her inability to assist in her defense or an inability to understand the nature of the proceedings.\nExperts from both the state and the defense examined Persina. After many delays, the state doctor from the Maryland Department of Health deemed Persina competent to stand trial on July 2.\nThe Office of the Public Defender represented Persina. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The pilot was the only person on board.\nMerlini was doing work with the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory's University Research Foundation, according to officials at the scene.\n\"It's a sad day for not only the aviation community, but for the scientific community,\" said David Abrams, the communication director for the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nThe FAA said the aircraft is a twin-engine Cessna 402. The plane was 30 years old, according to MSP.\nAccording to David Heidhausen, president at the University Research Foundation, the plane was used for advanced research and development. Heidhausen said the projects included enhanced flight vision systems, cameras in the nose and helmet-mounted displays.\nHeidhausen said Merlini was not developing research but relocating the plane in a \"ferry flight\" when he crashed.\nAccording to a preliminary investigation, the aircraft took off shortly before 9 a.m. from Tipton Airport at Fort Meade before crashing into the Tred Avon River, MSP said. Police believe the pilot was headed toward the Easton Airport when the crash occurred.\nThe Easton air traffic control tower reported the incident to the emergency dispatch center, as did witnesses who observed the crash.\nThe FAA said it will work with the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct an investigation.\nMerlini's identity was released following the notification of his next of kin. Merlini was recovered from the water and transported to the shore, where EMS personnel declared him deceased at the scene. He will be transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for autopsy.\nLiz Underhill, who lives along the Tred Avon, received a call from a neighbor who had seen the plane in the water. Underhill got in her boat and attempted to assess the situation. She saw the plane in the water, but no one was out of the plane.\nThere were numerous other people in boats trying to help.\nAmong the agencies on the scene were the Coast Guard, Talbot County Sheriff, Maryland State Police, Maryland Natural Resources Police, Easton Volunteer Fire Department, St. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department, Anne Arundel County Fire Department and Talbot County Emergency Services.\nKonner Metz contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wicomico Narcotics is a designated Washington/Baltimore HIDTA-funded initiative.\nAssisting agencies include the Drug Enforcement Administration, Maryland State Police, Somerset County Sheriff's Office, Worcester Sheriff's Office, Wicomico Sheriff's Office, Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, Talbot County Sheriff's Office, Kent County Sheriff's Office, Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Strike Force 7, Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office, Eastern Shore Information Center, Homeland Security Investigations, Salisbury Police Department, Ocean City Police Department, and the Maryland Department of Transportation Authority Police.\nThis operation was supported in part by the Maryland Criminal Intelligence Network.

    "content": "Mid-Shore organization pioneers a 'hub' of resources for victims of domestic violence\n\n December 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 For more than four decades, the Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence has been at the forefront of advocating for victims on the Mid-Shore. With a new program, the organization is now planning to assist far beyond.The nonprofit for victims of domestic violence has taken steps to advance resource access for clients using the Geographic Information System program, a mapping dashboard providing a free one-stop shop for essential resources for victims.\nJeanne Yeager, executive director for Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence, said rural clients face various barriers to receiving care. During the pandemic the barriers to care were more apparent and Mid-Shore Council sought to find alternative solutions to helping their clients.\nThis initiative, she said, revolutionizes the way domestic violence victims access vital resources.\n\"I was really mindful of coming out of COVID, because everything we did at Mid-Shore was very one-on-one, personalized \u2014 our case management, our meetings, our support groups, everything \u2014 and we would say, 'Oh, well, we'll do an online group sometime.' Well, 'that sometime' became tomorrow,\" Yeager said. \"So it normalized using technology, and I think there's no turning back.\"\nThe barriers faced by victims in rural communities include limited employment opportunities, spotty cell service, transportation, lack of affordable housing, and social and geographic isolation.\nThe GIS program operates with a holistic Chesapeake Crisis-to-Self-Sufficiency model, providing comprehensive services and case management from crisis through transition to self-sufficiency.\nAccording to Yeager, the program initially focused on mapping out housing resources in five counties in Maryland. The data team began working with case managers and staff to compile a list of resources that clients frequently inquire about, such as childcare and pet care.\nFrom there it continued to expand.\nKazeem Anifowoshe, GIS senior data analyst, said the project went from the initial five counties to nine counties, and the team decided to create a website as a \"hub\" for the project. Now, this hub is used by 25 agencies and has expanded resources to include nearby pro bono and legal services across Maryland through a partnership with the Access to Justice organization.\n\"When people kind of think of victim services, there's kind of like a formula that a lot of people have been doing for 20 to 40 plus years at their organization that works for them,\" Anifowoshe said. \"But again, we're just trying to make things easier the best way we know how, by mapping things.\"\nAccording to Yeager, the GIS program has been earning notable recognition, such as the prestigious Domestic Shelters Purple Ribbon Award.\nThe organization's GIS Hub integrates data from various sources, including popular rental property platforms/affordable housing, childcare resources, medical facilities, grocery stores, law enforcement agencies, court houses and local social service organizations.\nPamela Caudill Jordan, program evaluator for the GIS Hub, said she hopes to encourage other organizations to adopt a comprehensive model where the focus is not just on crisis intervention but on helping survivors achieve long-term stability and self-sufficiency. For Caudill Jordan, having access to tools such as the GIS Hub can make the work of advocates for victims easier and more efficient.\nAccording to Yeager and Anifowoshe, the goal is to get the GIS Hub more widely adopted and used by other organizations, going beyond Maryland and, hopefully, one day nationwide.\n\"We know what victims need,\" Yeager said. \"We ought to work with victims, and we're making this available. Let's see where we're going with it.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "St. Michaels VFD places new engine into service\n\n August 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - A brand new piece of fire equipment is in service for the residents of St. Michaels and Talbot County.St. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department's Engine 45, an engine tanker, was put into service on July 27 and has already run calls, including pumping water for the response to an attic fire in town last week.Engine 45 is a 2023 E-One Cyclone, featuring a 1,035-gallon water tank, Cummins L9 engine, Hale QMAX pump, Harrison Hydraulic Generator, Whelen and Firetech lighting, and an Arkon Electric Monitor.St. Michaels VFD President Chris Thomas said the new engine has a larger water tank, a necessity in the rural environs of St. Michaels and elsewhere the engine will serve in the area, often not near hydrants.The new engine carries 1,000 feet of 5-inch supply hose, 500 feet of 3-inch hose, five attack lines, a Blitzfire Monitor, a battery powered fan and work lights, and a full complement of firefighting tools.Engine 45 replaced Engine 49, a 2009 engine, in the top of SMVFD's rotation as the \"first due\" engine. Engine 45 was purchased to replace Engine 48, a 1990 engine that served the department for 33 years, and was placed in reserve in the department's fleet.Thomas said the older engine had exceeded the expected 30-year service window, and that while it is still serviceable, parts for repairs are getting harder to find and the apparatus lacks updated safety features.Typically, the department would sell the engine, Thomas said, but it is being retained as a precaution due to the lengthy lead time to fill orders that has become the norm in the fire apparatus manufacturing industry.Engine 45 was designed by the SMFD Engine committee and purchased through Patriot Fire in Grasonville. The engine cost $718,850 and carries well over $200,000 of tools, hose, radios and breathing apparatus.The RFP for the new engine was put out in 2021, and the committee moved swiftly to finalize the purchase, and the efficient of the process led to the relatively rapid acquisition and placement into service, Thomas said.The funding for the fire apparatus came from a variety of sources. \"It's a combination of fundraising efforts and money that we get from the county, town and state,\" Thomas said.\"The department thanks the generous residents and businesses who helped make this purchase happen through their donations and support over the past few years,\" the fire department said in a statement about the new engine.Thomas, who is in his third year as the department's president, said the department's board does a good job of strategic budgeting for future equipment replacements and maintenance of the fire station.Fundraising efforts include barbecue chicken dinners, a fund drive and a rotation of other types of campaigns, but he said the department's pit beef and pit turkey offerings were particularly tasty. \"I think that it is off the charts it's phenomenal,\" he said.SMVFD has around 70 members, and of those about half are fire and EMS personnel.Just like fire companies across the country, paid and volunteer alike, SMVFD faces a manpower crunch.Thomas said the nature of the demographics of the St. Michaels area poses a challenge for the department, as many residents are retirees, although the talent pool of retirees helps ensure the administrative part of the community organization is well staffed.As far as fire and EMS personnel, Thomas said, \"We're hurting just like everyone else.\" Still, the department forges on as the status quo of consistent calls for emergency response continues, and the department continues to plan and save for future acquisitions.Thomas said the brush truck and tanker truck are both in the latter stages of their service, and the department continues its work on that front too, continuing to raise and secure funds and being prepared for what is now a three-to five-year wait time on new equipment.The newest member of the SMVFD fleet isn't the first with the title of \"Engine 45\" - the previous 45 was an engine with an open cab and tailboards that volunteers ride on, braving the heat and cold depending on the season, before carrying out their emergency response.The equipment has changed, but the fundamental aspects of the job have not. Engine 45 sits in the right hand of the middle bay of the firehouse, waiting to carry to the volunteers to the next call. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSt. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department President Chris Thomas gives a thumbs up as he pulls Engine 45 out of the engine bay. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chadnee Harris, 33, will serve 236 days followed by one year of probation, with the remainder of the sentence suspended.\nHarris originally faced charges of of acting as an accessory after the fact of first- and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony for the same incident. The charges were amended to one count of altering physical evidence.\nThe charge stems from a shooting in the parking lot of Sidetracked Saloon in Easton on Sept. 30. Officers who responded to the incident just before 2 a.m. found Smith in the parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound to the head. Smith was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was pronounced dead.\nOn May 20, Kevron Chase, 35, of Cambridge, pled guilty to first-degree murder for Smith's death. A sentencing hearing for Chase is set for July 19.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in charging documents, police said the bar's security camera footage showed Chase and Harris standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.\nAccording to the documents, Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed it at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.\nAfter a fight broke out, Harris reportedly walked toward the men. A crowd that had gathered quickly dispersed. According to the charging documents, Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him. The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.\nAt Chase's plea hearing on May 20, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said Chase then left the scene and drove to Cambridge, where he disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River.\nChase and Harris were later found during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. They were both detained by police. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He said a lot of the money for these donations, which Post 77 makes annually, is raised through the slot machines located at the post.\nDonations were made to volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, nearly 20 churches and a variety of other organizations, such as the Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers, the Talbot Senior Center, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society and the Neighborhood Service Center.\nRepresentatives from these organizations came out Saturday morning to the American Legion to accept the donations.\nBlack said the event was wonderful and all the recipients were \"very pleased.\"\nAccording to a statement from one recipient organization, Channel Marker, which offers mental health and wellness support, this donation will help improve the wellbeing of its clients' lives.\nCritchlow Adkins Children's Centers Executive Director Cristy Morrell said the event Saturday was \"lovely.\"\n\"They support such amazing organizations in our community,\" she said. \"And they're not always organizations that I think people are aware of. And so, that they include us in with those organizations is very humbling and we're very honored.\"\nMorrell said the \"generous\" donation will be used for enrichment programming and tuition assistance at the Children's Center's Trappe and Easton locations.\n\"I'm just honored that they consider us a worthwhile cause,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ross stated that Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning.\nA tentative trial date has been scheduled for Aug. 19 at 9 a.m., according to the Maryland Electronic Courts website.\nAccording to court documents, the bench warrant can be executed once Rider has been released from Johns Hopkins Hospital.\nThe $20,000 unsecured bond that Rider had been released on in February 2023 also was revoked Monday.\nRider's attorney Stephanie Shipley filed a motion Friday to postpone the trial, according to court documents. In the motion, it states that Rider had been admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital \"on an emergency basis for acute medical issues, with further transfer planned to an inpatient facility in the State of Maryland.\"\nOn the same day, the State's Attorney's Office issued its position on the defendant's motion to postpone the trial. According to court documents, the state's consent to the postponement was contingent upon \"further appropriate medical documentation.\"\nShipley presented an updated letter from Johns Hopkins Hospital at the status hearing Monday morning.\nThe 15 charges Rider faces stem from a Nov. 24, 2022, incident where firefighters responded to a fire at Rider's home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton.\nDeputy State Fire Marshal Shayne McKinney, who investigated the fire and authored the incident narrative, wrote in charging documents that a Talbot County deputy responding to the scene informed him Rider had possibly attempted suicide that evening based on evidence found within the home. Rider had attempted suicide in the past as well, according to the deputy.\nAccording to court documents, a person connected to Rider told officials he had called Rider several times that evening, adding that Rider had clearly indicated to him that he was attempting suicide and wanted to be left alone. Charging documents indicated that Rider told the person that he lit the house on fire during their conversation.\nRider was located a short distance away from the home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary.\nAccording to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put emergency services personnel, specifically more than 45 firefighters who responded, in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nRider was arrested in February 2023 and released on a $20,000 unsecured bond.\nIn April 2023, Rider entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity, according to documents filed in court. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was pronounced dead at about 2:06 p.m., the town said.\nGreensboro Police Department requested dispatch to notify a forensic investigator and have them respond to the location.\nEMS then placed two sheets over the man, preventing him from being viewed by the public. The forensic investigator arrived on the scene at about 4:30 p.m., then they consulted the medical examiner's office in Baltimore that an autopsy would be needed.\nThe forensic investigator contacted Springbok to transport the body to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The estimated time of arrival was initially an hour and a half, but due to a 16-mile Bay Bridge back-up, the transport was delayed and didn't arrive until 7 p.m.\nEMS, the forensic investigator and the Greensboro Police Department offered to moved the man out of the environment, back inside the residence or place him in a body bag. The family declined all options, the town said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The man was transported by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, where he later died.\nThe man, described in the release as a \"30-year-old Caucasian male from Cambridge,\" has not been publicly identified. The police officer who shot the man has also not been publicly identified.\nAccording to the release, shortly after 5 p.m. Thursday, officers responded to the Deep Harbor development around Seaway Lane and Riverview Wharf in reference to a report of a male subject chasing a female subject with a knife.\nWhen officers arrived, they encountered a male subject who was armed with a knife, police said. Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said three officers were on the scene.\n\"Officers on scene attempted to deescalate the situation and have the subject drop the knife,\" the release said. \"The subject refused and advanced on officers. Officers gave warnings for the subject to stop as they were attempting to retreat.\"\nPolice said the subject continued to engage and approach the officers, leading to one officer shooting the man.\n\"Officers immediately rendered life saving measures to the subject awaiting EMS arrival,\" the release said. \"After EMS arrived, the subject was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge prior to being flown by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury.\"\nAccording to Todd, this is Cambridge's first fatal police shooting in approximately 15 years.\nThe incident is being investigated by the Maryland attorney general's office's Independent Investigations Division, which investigates all officer-involved fatalities in the state. Todd said the officer who discharged their weapon has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation is complete.\nTodd said press releases and body-worn camera footage will be released to the public as part of the transparency process.\n\"I think the main thing I want to say is my condolences to the family of the subject that succumbed to his injuries. Unfortunately, it's a sad situation,\" Todd said. \"And speaking with some of the family, I just feel there needs to be thoughts and prayers kept for them as well.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trooper 7 guided ground rescue crews to the victim location, but conditions proved to be inaccessible by foot or boat.MSP's Trooper 2, which is based at Joint Base Andrews, was dispatched at about 1:20 a.m. to assist with a hoist extraction and take over rescue operations.Once overhead, the pilots on Trooper 2 hovered the Leonardo AW-139 helicopter approximately 50 feet above the marshy terrain while a trooper/paramedic was lowered below to assess the victim.The victim was extracted utilizing the air-lift rescue vest. The trooper/paramedic and victim were hoisted back into the aircraft.Trooper 2 then landed at a landing zone established by the Dorchester County Fire and EMS Department, where the victim was transferred to ground paramedics for a secondary evaluation.The victim ultimately did not require treatment or transport.The Maryland State Police Aviation Command has served Maryland citizens since 1970 and operates a fleet of 10 AW-139 helicopters from seven bases throughout the State. Each aircraft provides coverage 24/7/365 to Maryland residents and visitors.The MSPAC missions include medevac, law enforcement, search and rescue, homeland security and disaster assessment.The success of the missions relies heavily on the cooperative efforts of local fire, rescue, EMS, law enforcement agencies and partners at the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Park Police. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Labastida was also sentenced to five years for first-degree conspiracy to escape, with all of those years suspended.\nLabastida will get credit for one year of time served.\nHe will serve five years of supervised probation following his release from prison. Conditions of probation include that he must receive a mental health evaluation and seek treatment, receive a substance abuse and alcohol evaluation and seek related treatment, abstain from alcohol and illegal drugs, stay away from the Eastern Shore Hospital Center, and not contact Darrin Jeter, 20, who was also involved in the incident.\nBefore Dean handed down the sentence, Leonard recommended Labastida be sentenced to five years without parole followed by five years of probation. Dean said she was \"taken aback\" by the state's \"lenient\" sentencing recommendation.\nShe said that although she feels for Labastida's family and the pain they have been going through, she also feels for the people that were at the psychiatric facility on the day of the escape.\nIn June, Labastida pleaded guilty to the three charges. The charges stem from Jeter's escape from the psychiatric facility located on Woods Road in Cambridge last year. At that time, Jeter, who has schizophrenia, had been committed to the hospital center.\nAt the June plea hearings for both Labastida and Jeter, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said Labastida approached the facility on Aug. 1, 2023 and shot into a window several times. She said Labastida and Jeter kicked out the broken window so Jeter could exit the building. The two fled the area in a black vehicle.\nJeter was located by the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office the following day. Leonard said Labastida was identified as a suspect through investigation. Evidence of an escape plan between the two was discovered through investigation, Leonard said at Jeter's hearing.\nJeter was sentenced to 10 years in prison for first-degree escape with eight of those years suspended.\nDuring Labastida's sentencing hearing Friday, defense attorney Marvin Ochoa said Labastida is sorry for his actions and is ashamed and embarrassed. He said when Labastida was in middle school, he withdrew from his family and started hanging out with the \"wrong\" crew, making bad decisions.\nOchoa said that when Labastida helped with the escape, his brain wasn't fully developed and didn't realize the consequences of his actions, including the \"pain and suffering\" it would cause his family.\nBefore showing the certificates Labastida was awarded for classes he took in jail, Ochoa said Labastida has \"a lot to give to this world\" and he just needs guidance and support.\nLabastida told Judge Karen Dean that there was no reason for him to do what he did on Aug. 1 2023, but there is also no reason for his life to be \"stunted.\" He said he believes he can be a productive member of society.\nLabastida's family also spoke at the hearing Friday, sharing the toll this incident has taken on their family. His mother Patricia Sanchez said her son \"has learned a lesson.\" She said that she never imagined she would see one of her children standing in front of a judge like this.\n\"We should (have been) getting ready to go to a graduation or something else,\" Sanchez said, \"not to this.\"\nLabastida's older brother, Nicholas Sanchez, said that Labastida is a hard worker and that with the right guidance, he can become a productive member of society.\nThe victim of Labastida's assault charge was not present at the hearing and did not wish to make an impact statement. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There have been multiple reports since last Friday.\n\"This is a trend that usually occurs every election cycle,\" Wright said. \"We've had two reported to us. One (sign) at the beginning of September and two (signs) over last weekend.\"\nEaston police have not yet identified any of those involved in the recent vandalism, Wright said.\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee Chair Robert Osborne said signs have been vandalized on Dover Street recently. Some have been spray painted, while others have been stolen.\nSigns stolen or vandalized include not just those for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but also candidates for the Talbot Board of Education. Osborne said, \"it's very frustrating that people don't want a different view.\"\n\"It's a shame that people have hate in their heart,\" Osborne said. \" \u2026 Everybody's in our prayers, we just want the election to be fair.\"\nPatrick Firth, chair of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said there has been sign vandalism against Democratic candidates in Oxford, Trappe and Cordova. Firth said the Talbot County Democratic Party condemns all vandalism.\n\"These acts of vandalism are not just about signs; they are about the erosion of the democratic process and the suppression of free speech,\" Firth said in a statement. \"We must hold ourselves to a higher standard, respecting the political views of all citizens, regardless of party affiliation.\"\nWright encourages residents to not place signs too close to their houses in case someone tries to damage or steal them.\nHe said while \"there's no doubt\" some acts of political sign vandalism go unreported, it's best to report them to police for documentation.\n\"Be vigilant. Report it if it happens to them. If for any reason, it gives us an idea if we need to concentrate on a certain area, or just so we know what's going on,\" Wright said. \"Because people are entering your property to commit a crime, and that should be concerning.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the nonprofit, reasons a child might be under court protection include abuse, neglect and abandonment.\nThose advocates are tasked with identifying a child's needs and advocating for the necessary services so their needs can be met. CASAs share their recommendations with the judge assigned to that child's case.\nCASA of the Mid-Shore Executive Director Robin Davenport said the work that the organization's volunteers do is \"heroic.\"\n\"In a nutshell, we're saying, 'Be a sponge,'\" she said about a CASA's role. \"Just go around and soak up every bit of information you can about the child. Wring the sponge out. Figure out what is important for us to be paying attention to and bringing to the court's attention.\"\nThough it can be considered rewarding, the volunteer gig \u2014 open to residents who are at least 21 years old \u2014 is a commitment.\nFollowing a lengthy application process and in-depth interview, those interested in volunteering with CASA of the Mid-Shore must complete eight training sessions. Once those trainings are complete and the volunteers have been sworn into the courthouses as officers of the court, they are assigned to a case.\nGenerally, CASAs are assigned to one case at a time. The length of a case can vary. And although the children are from one of the four counties served by CASA of the Mid-Shore, a lot of the time they are living in placements outside the four counties, Davenport said.\nCrawford said the decision to become a CASA volunteer isn't always an easy one to make.\n\"Once people learn about the program and what's required, sometimes they need to think about it too because of that commitment,\" she said.\nJanet Healy, a Talbot County resident, has been a CASA volunteer since 2008. After a career as an educator, Healy wanted to find a volunteer opportunity where she could work with kids in a less \"intensive\" way, she said.\n\"And it just seemed like the right fit,\" she said about volunteering with CASA of the Mid-Shore.\nFor Healy, one of the most rewarding aspects of the job is building relationships.\n\"(Building relationships) with kids, with foster parents, with social workers,\" she said, later adding, \"It's hard when things don't work out the way you think they should, but it's also, on the other hand, very rewarding.\"\nHealy said one adoptive mother still sends her photos of the sibling group that she was a CASA for about four years ago.\n\"That's very rewarding to get some of that feedback,\" she said. \"To see how well some of these kids are doing.\"\nBut there are challenging aspects of the job, too. Davenport said it's important for CASAs to take things slow and be consistent when building relationships with the children. She said they tell volunteers not to take things personally.\nA child might be dealing with trauma, she said, \"and so there are a lot of things that we have to just keep track of and measure things in very small victories.\"\nHealy said making recommendations to judges is a big responsibility. She said taking on the role of a CASA means becoming invested and emotionally involved.\n\"Because you do get very invested in these kids, but you know it really is temporary,\" she said. \"You have to keep that in the back of your mind all the time.\"\nBECOMING TOUCHSTONESCASA of the Mid-Shore is celebrating 35 years of service in 2025. Davenport has been there since the beginning. She has seen the organization grow not only in staff, but in the number of counties it serves.\n\"It was a very tiny, tiny organization,\" she said about the nonprofit's start. \"We, at that point, were only Talbot County.\"\nOn May 17, the nonprofit will host a special fundraiser called \"Voices of Hope.\" The celebration is, in part, to celebrate CASA of the Mid-Shore's successful 35 years and kick off its next 35.\nDavenport said that over the years, she's seen CASAs become \"incredible touchstones\" for the children they advocate for.\n\"The CASA volunteers end up kind of being the one consistent adult in these children's lives,\" she said. \"Foster care is not a short turnaround usually. So it's been really exciting for us to see that the CASAs themselves are not only helping the judge, but they're actually really giving messages to the children that stick with them for years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Number of Cambridge homicides down in 2023\n\n January 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 There were less than half as many homicides in Cambridge in 2023 compared to the year before.In 2022, Cambridge saw seven homicides. In 2023, it saw three.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd, who was sworn in as chief in January of 2023, called the difference progress. He credits the decrease in homicides to a few different things \u2014 namely, how the department polices and its partnerships with other agencies.\nOne of the police department's top priorities last year was community-oriented policing. For Todd, that meant being a part of the community that the department services.\nHe said getting out into neighborhoods and creating programs like neighborhood watches can help build relationships and trust in communities and, hopefully, reduce crime.\nAlong with prioritizing community policing, Todd said that the department has tried to be proactive in addressing gun violence and aggressive assaults. He said CPD is now taking an average of one gun off the street each week, \"well more than double\" the average in 2022.\nTodd also stressed the importance of working with other agencies and working with the community. He said that being a part of the Dorchester County Task Force, getting support from Cambridge City Council and focusing on community-oriented policing has all made a difference.\n\"I think a lot of people have come to the table in the last year,\" he said.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said this decrease in the number of homicides in Cambridge is a significant one.\n\"Every shooting that we can stop is a step in the right direction,\" he said.\nRideout said he thinks CPD's community policing efforts are part of the reason for that success.\n\"It's just started, but I think they're building a trust within the community that just did not exist before now,\" he said.\nLieutenant Kyle Clark with Maryland State Police's Homicide Unit said that although he can't say for certain why the number of homicides has gone down in Cambridge, he can say that there has been a focus on collaboration between agencies.\n\"We do concentrate on a lot of collaborative efforts with other units within the State Police and also allied agencies,\" he said, specifying the use of task forces, gang units and gun units. \"And those are all tools that we use to combat the crime in any city.\"\nClark said that he would estimate about 50% of the homicides in the last two years in Cambridge have been gang-related. He said that in addressing gang violence, MSP, along with other agencies at all levels, do \"everything and anything\" to combat the gang violence.\nTodd said CPD is working to identify gang members and groups that are \"constantly harassing\" residents in different Cambridge neighborhoods. He said they have worked with the different agencies within the Dorchester County Task Force as well as federal agencies to identify who is bringing in handguns and where they are coming from.\n\"The partnership's been great with the Task Force and Maryland State Police,\" he said. \"The Homicide Unit with Maryland State Police \u2014 they handle all of our homicides. So we work hand in hand together. And that's what it's going to take.\"\nTodd said he has noticed gun violence and homicide rates begin to fall throughout the country.\nSpecific data on other crime rates in Cambridge should be released to the public in the next couple of weeks, Todd said.\nRideout said early intervention is important when it comes to crime prevention. Rideout was recently at a meeting about a flag football initiative by CPD and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.\n\"It was really an exciting possibility of where we can really start focusing, not only on the crime itself, but on the prevention and early intervention,\" he said.\nRideout added that engaging children in education and outside activities, such as programming at the YMCA or Boys and Girls Club, can have a positive effect.\nGoing into 2024, CPD's goals include continuing to build its manpower, focusing on data-driven technology and \"patrolling with a purpose.\"\nTodd said \"patrolling with a purpose\" means putting officers in the areas where crimes are occurring on the specific days and at the specific times they have been occurring.\nHe said that residents can also expect to see more data from CPD in the new year, including heat maps of where crimes are occurring.\nRegarding homicides, Rideout said the downward trend is good, but added that the work doesn't stop here.\n\"What we have to do is continue working on it and engage the community in working on it to hopefully keep these numbers down,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But all counties have yet to reach an agreement. The Queen Anne's commissioners gave their approval to the Mid-Shore Regional Detention Center Cooperative Service Agreement final draft Jan. 28, as did Kent. Caroline remains uncommitted.The new jail facility aims to address the growing need for modern and efficient detention facilities in the region, where counties are struggling to finance renovations or replacements of their aging detention facilities.\nThe corrections facility is proposed to be owned by Queen Anne's County with employment also falling under Queen Anne's County; the goal being to assimilate the current Kent and Caroline correctional officers.\nThe agreement has been a collaboration between the three counties for several months, Queen Anne's County Administrator Todd Mohn said.\nWith Kent County also approving the final draft, the agreement is still waiting on a public hearing from Caroline County. If Caroline doesn't sign, Kent Commissioners said they would renegotiate with Queen Anne's alone.\nKent Commissioner John Price made the motion to a unanimous vote. The facility will be built regardless, he said, noting the number of beds would be the primary change if Caroline dropped out.\nIn a recent meeting of the Caroline County commissioners, they said they still have not received exact numbers for how much everything will cost and how much the county will save by joining the agreement with the other counties.\nCaroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter suggested that the county should do an independent evaluation of the operating cost.\n\"This decision is going to depend on the operational cost and I'm talking long range operational cost,\" Porter said. \"Would it make sense for us to engage someone to do an independent evaluation of these operating cost?\"\nEach county is currently operating their own jails and have either exceeded inmate capacity or need extensive renovation.\nWith the State of Maryland willing to fund up to 50% of the costs of the design and construction, a regional detention center is anticipated to be of less cost to the citizens.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil noted the regional and state effort, \"is a savings for all three counties.\"\nAt about 100 years old, Caroline's facility in particularly is in need of improvement, according to Queen Anne's commissioners. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her father, John Harris Jr., and her uncle were members of Post 77, which operates on Glenwood Avenue.\nWith members of Post 77 in attendance, council members expressed nothing but support for the project.\n\"I think that this is a great endeavor,\" Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis said. \"(It's important) that we don't lose the memory of those persons who fought for our country. I believe it's our responsibility to help out with this project. Secondly, it doesn't cost the town a dime.\"\nThe Hometown Heroes Banner program began in 2006 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Today, Mid-Shore towns including Federalsburg, Hurlock and Preston showcase banners honoring past and present veterans.\nHarris-Brooks said the banners would cost $200 each. There will be no ask of the council to provide any money for the project.\nShe asked that the town office hold blank applications for interested families, in addition to applications being advertised on social media and at Post 77.\n\"It will instill a sense of pride and unity in Easton and for our country,\" Harris-Brooks told the council. \"It is our goal that you grant us approval. And we believe that if you grant us an approval, this will make a landmark for you as our councilmen.\"\nCouncil members unanimously approved the request. Prior to voting, the council expressed hopes that the banner project could extend to the entire town.\nHarris-Brooks said that Post 77 will accept donations from the community that can help families who cannot afford the cost of a banner. She added that Post 77 will work with American Legion Talbot Post 70, Easton Utilities and the town as the project comes to life.\n\"I think our children need to be aware,\" Harris-Brooks said. \"We still have young people still enlisted in the service. I will just very passionately say my uncle was a member of Post 77 \u2026 He gave his ultimate self serving.\"\nCommander Victor Middleton thanked the council for their support following the approval.\n\"When people say thank you for your service, it really lifted me up just now to a higher level,\" Middleton said. \"And I thank you all.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Second fatal crash in three days prompts re-closure of Price Station Road crossover on U.S. 301\n\n July 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHURCH HILL \u2014 Following two fatal crashes in three days, state transportation officials have ordered the closure of the MD 405 (Price Station Road) median crossover at U.S. Route 301 in Queen Anne's County.The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration announced Friday, July 25, that the crossover will be closed beginning Saturday, July 26. Emergency vehicle access will be maintained, and alternate crossovers are available at MD 19 (Roberts Station Road), two miles north, and Hayden Clark Road, 1.7 miles south.\n\"This is a safety-focused decision,\" said State Highway Administrator Will Pines. \"This closure is necessary to save lives and make the corridor safer for the tens of thousands of travelers and residents who use it every day.\"\nThe announcement follows two deadly collisions at the intersection this week, resulting in three fatalities.\nOn Thursday, July 24, a two-vehicle crash occurred around noon, leaving two people dead at the scene.\nJust two days earlier, another woman was killed when her vehicle was struck by a southbound car as she attempted to cross Route 301. The impact caused her car to overturn. The other vehicle's two occupants \u2014 a 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman \u2014 were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore in critical condition.\nThe State Highway Administration had previously closed the crossover in July 2024 due to a high number of crashes. Between January 2019 and December 2023, there were 76 reported crashes at the site \u2014 62 of them in the southbound lanes, most attributed to driver inattention or failure to yield. Despite safety upgrades such as restriping, rumble strips, additional signage, and channelizing devices, collisions have continued at an alarming rate.\nTroopers from the Centreville Barrack of the Maryland State Police, Queen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann, and first responders from the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company have all voiced strong support for the closure.\nThe Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company confirmed Friday that it had been notified of the closure and has coordinated with SHA to ensure continued emergency access to communities east of Route 301, including Price and Bridgetown Estates.\n\"As we did in July of 2024, the department leadership reached out to SHA to ensure emergency access would be available to Fire, EMS, and Police units responding to emergency calls on the east side of Route 301,\" the fire company said in a statement. \"We have been assured by SHA leadership that they intend to use the same process as before and that emergency access will be available.\n\"While this will create a slight delay in response times, we appreciate the willingness of SHA to work with us to keep those delays as short as possible while long-term solutions for the crossover are worked. The leadership of the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company is committed to providing the most timely and efficient emergency response possible and will continue to monitor the situation and be a partner with SHA for a permanent solution.\"\nSen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) also voiced support for the re-closure, stating, \"Given the dangerous track record at this intersection \u2014 and now two fatal accidents in just three days \u2014 it is clear that further action is urgently needed. While I understand the temporary inconvenience to motorists, public safety must come first.\"\nThe Maryland State Police Crash Team is leading both crash investigations. Findings will be submitted to the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office for review. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She knew the man. He drugged her before raping her, she said.\nAfter a few weeks of \"throwing up constantly\" and \"crying uncontrollably,\" Cheaton went to rehab to get treatment.\nShe said it was her therapist that told her she didn't have to face her assaulter in the Bradford House halls everyday, and there were resources that could keep him out of the building.\nAlthough Cheaton said she didn't call the police after she was raped, she did get restraining order against her rapist later on.\nBut despite the restraining order, Cheaton said she would still see her rapist in the halls at Bradford House.\nUnder the Violence Against Women Act, a housing provider may evict or terminate the assistance of a perpetrator of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Notice of Occupancy Rights under the Violence Against Women Act.\nAccording to the notice, those who have experienced domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking must have the option to stay in their subsidized housing and can request an emergency transfer from the housing provider for safety reasons.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat, Millennia Housing Management \u2014 which manages Bradford House \u2014 said the Bradford House property management team sends violations to anyone residing at the property that is the cause of an assault or theft.\nCheaton said she is not the only tenant that has been raped in the building. And this is not the only time Cheaton said she has been put in danger at Bradford House. She said she has also been held at knifepoint, threatened and assaulted on the property.\nIn one instance, Cheaton remembers taking her dog outside a few hours after midnight.\n\"I had just shut that door,\" she said. \"And somebody standing way down there at the end of the building was hollering at me.\"\nCheaton, who said she doesn't leave the door to the building open for anyone, said the person was telling her to leave the door open.\nShe said the man got in her face and threatened to shoot her. By the time police arrived, he was gone, Cheaton said.\nAccording to a Cambridge Police Department calls for service report requested by the Star Democrat, of the 1,099 calls for service to Bradford House made between Aug. 1, 2021, and Feb. 21, 2024, 18 were for reports of threats.\nAfter being threatened outside the building, Cheaton \u2014 who has had experiences with substance abuse \u2014 said she moved out of Bradford House for about a month to live with her daughter.\n\"To stay sober in a building like this is very, very difficult,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He pleaded guilty in February to six counts of promoting and distributing child pornography. During the plea hearing, Braun said he pleaded guilty because he was guilty and it was in his best interest.\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan handed down a five-year sentence with all but one year, five months and 29 days suspended. That nearly 18-month term began June 26.\nBraun was previously charged on 34 total counts \u2014 17 for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 for possessing child pornography. As part of the six-count plea agreement, the state did not prosecute the remaining 28 charges.\nAt the February plea hearing, prosecutors said the Easton Police Department received a tip last year from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children about a person possessing child sexual abuse material. Investigators identified that person as Braun, prosecutors said.\nBraun will be registered as a tier II sex offender.

After confirming the active warrant, deputies arrested Wolfe at his Stevensville residence. He was charged as a fugitive from justice and held pending extradition to Kentucky to face the charges.\n\"This case highlights the value of interagency cooperation,\" public information officer Kaitlyn Briselli said in a statement. \"By working closely with our partners in other jurisdictions, we were able to locate and apprehend a fugitive whose actions threatened the safety of our community and, most importantly, our children.\"\nIn an unrelated case, the sheriff's office said Jamie Lee Overton Jr., 23, of Essex, was arrested on Sept. 24 in Baltimore and held without bond following an investigation into a report received Aug. 30. A county resident alleged an unknown adult male contacted their child, younger than 12, for sexual purposes, according to the sheriff's office.\nAfter reviewing evidence, investigators obtained a warrant Sept. 19 charging Overton with sexual solicitation of a minor, two counts of child pornography and two counts of obscene telephone misuse, the sheriff's office said.\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, the sheriff's office said it could not release specifics on how the child was contacted. Detectives are reviewing evidence to determine whether additional victims may be involved.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Detective Cpl. Parker at gparker@qac.org or call the anonymous tip line at 410-758-6666. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sgt. Jason Dyott, 38, was convicted of two separate instances of engaging in physical sexual conduct with two different teenage girls while on duty.Judge C. Carey Deeley Jr. found Easton Police Department Dyott guilty on two counts of misconduct in office. Dyott \u2014 who had served as an Easton police officer since approximately June 2008 \u2014 was found guilty under three theories of misconduct: malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance.\nThe charges stem from allegations that Dyott used his departmental cell phone to communicate in a sexual manner with several teenagers and students at local high schools and met up with them while on duty. Two teenage girls are mentioned in a charging document from the Office of the State Prosecutor.\nDuring opening statements of the trial, Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Mary Setzer said that in the fall of 2022, Dyott engaged in physical acts with two teenage girls in separate instances. She said that on Nov. 11, Dyott picked up an 18-year-old from her friend's house in his police vehicle and had sex with her in the vehicle while on duty.\nSetzer said that two days later, Dyott met with a 17-year-old in the Target parking lot while he was on duty and made out with her. According to the charging document, Dyott leveraged his position as a police officer to engage in this sexual relationship and sent her multiple photographs of him in his police uniform with sexually provocative language attached.\nDyott's defense attorney Shaun Owens said during opening statements that Dyott is not denying the relationships with the teenagers. Owens said the conduct was not criminal, however, and that he does not believe there is evidence to support that Dyott's actions constituted misconduct.\nOwens said the state would need to prove that Dyott engaged in the acts because he was a police officer or because he had been afforded that privilege as a police officer. Owens said that in any profession, Dyott could have engaged in the exact same behavior.\nDuring the trial, both of the then-teenagers mentioned in the charging document testified. The then-17-year-old said that when the investigation into Dyott began, Dyott told her to deny what happened, and he said they didn't do anything wrong because she was old enough to consent.\nThe then-18-year-old recounted the night she met up with Dyott. She said that while in the police vehicle, the police radio was on, and after she heard a badge number spoken over the radio, Dyott turned the radio down. She said that she and Dyott didn't have any conversations about Dyott's job during their interaction, and Dyott didn't respond to work during that time.\nDuring closing arguments, Owens brought up that the radio call, which the then-18-year-old talked about during testimony. He said that it was not clear what the call was about, if it was for Dyott specifically or if it required Dyott's response.\nDeputy State Prosecutor Sarah David said that in the two incidents, Dyott acted in his official capacity. Not only was he on duty, she said, but he was presenting himself to the public and to the teenage girls as an officer.\nA sentencing hearing is set for Nov. 1.\nAccording to a news release from the Office of the State Prosecutor, State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said, \"Law enforcement officers who abuse the power of their position, and betray the trust of the community, must be held accountable.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Wednesday, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said Dyott is suspended with pay. He has been suspended with pay since the beginning stages of the investigation in 2023.\nIn 2014, Dyott was named the Easton's department's officer of the year.\nAccording to a Wednesday press release, \"upon this conviction, the Easton Police Department will now seek to impose the appropriate administrative penalties upon Mr. Dyott.\"\nLowery said he could not say at this time when those administrative penalties will be imposed.\nThis article may be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot County law enforcement officials raised concerns about the rule in the context of parallel criminal investigations, according to minutes from the Board's August meeting.Police Accountability Board Chair Mitch Ettinger agreed to address the issue in the report.Further discussion will take place at the December meeting. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMembers of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, seated to the right, listen to the county's top law enforcement officials during a Nov. 14 meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Attorney takes on ICE on Eastern Shore\n\n September 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN \u2014 Criminal defense attorney Ivette Furneisen has made it her mission to stand between federal agents and some of her clients.From courtrooms to detention centers, she is fighting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on behalf of families across the Eastern Shore.\nHaving gone through the immigration process herself, she understands what it entails. Lately, she said, the road has gotten more difficult under the Trump administration.\n\"In general, I see that people are being picked up and detained for minor traffic offenses,\" she said.\nThis was not so during past administrations, she said. Under other administrations, felonies and misdemeanors such as assault, theft, neglect of a minor and sex crimes would lead to deportation since they are crimes of moral turpitude.\n\"Under Trump however,\" she said, \"people are being picked up for minor offenses and then targeted by ICE.\"\nThat's the distinction.\nIn a recent case, her client was charged with driving under the influence by local police for having open alcohol containers in the back seat. He was acquitted, she said, but it put a target on her client for ICE.\nFurneisen recalled that her client was leaving the hospital between Kent and Talbot counties after his wife's medical checkup when he was stopped by ICE. She said agents busted out the windows while his pregnant wife was in the car and detained him. Furneisen and his loved ones did not know where he was for three days.\nShe said that level of apprehension is heightened by more ICE presence, including in courtrooms.\nIn her first case of this happening recently, two undercover ICE agents approached her client in court, asked their name, then hauled them into a van.\n\"I am seeing a lot of failure to appear in court, especially for minor traffic violations, and that makes things worse for those facing charges,\" she said. \"I tell them they need to show up for court with a lawyer.\"\nIt could mean the difference between paying a fine and being detained by ICE.\n\"That's why I fight so hard for them,\" she said. \"If I can get them out of jail at the bail review, they will have a better chance to stay with their families. If they go to jail, their life in the U.S. is over.\"\nShe said these are not isolated incidents.\n\"I am swamped with work of this nature,\" she said, noting cases from Kent to Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe attorney has built her practice around these kinds of challenges.\nFurneisen has worked hard all of her life, immigrating from Spain, establishing herself as a prominent immigration attorney on the Eastern Shore. She is half of the law firm of Campbell and Furneisen, located on Cross Street in Chestertown.\nThe firm's expertise earned Furneisen the 2024 Women to Watch recognition, an honor sponsored by the Kent County News' parent company, Adams MultiMedia. She is one of the only Spanish-speaking attorneys on the Eastern Shore, dealing with criminal, traffic and immigration cases.\nFurneisen received her law degree from the University of Barcelona Law School. After becoming a United States citizen, she received her master's degree in U.S. law from George Mason Law School. She is admitted to practice in both state and federal courts in Maryland, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\nThat background and the multiple courts where she is admitted have come in handy in the past year as a criminal attorney that handles some immigration cases.\nIn the past, anyone could request a bond hearing. Now, she said, the federal government wants to limit or eliminate bond eligibility for many immigrants detained by ICE, particularly those who entered the U.S. illegally.\n\"The problem is that this will lead to indefinite detention because there is a backlog in immigration court,\" she said. \"These people could be detained for years before they have their immigration hearing.\"\nFurneisen described one client who was told not to plead guilty to theft and he would receive probation before judgment \u00a9, which is not considered a conviction under immigration law. Her client pleaded not guilty and paid full restitution.\nThe judge ordered the detention center to release her client, but the center did not comply. She filed a writ of habeas corpus to release him, but ICE picked him up and gave him an option: get deported or sign a voluntary departure.\nHe chose the latter and went back to an area where his brothers and cousins were tortured before being beheaded by a gang.\n\"That's why I fight so hard to keep them here, but sometimes everything goes against you and you lose those battles,\" she said.\nShe said some of her clients, the ones who are undocumented, pay taxes through special IRS rules.\n\"They work in the county, they pay taxes and they are contributing, but they are still getting deported,\" she said.\nHer view aligns with Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown, who has said that immigration violations are a federal civil matter, not a state-level criminal offense.\nKent County Sheriff Dennis Hickman said his office's stance on ICE has not changed since March.\n\"In the past ICE has placed a detainer on illegal immigrants who were being held on local charges,\" Hickman wrote, \"but when the sentence was over they were required to come get them. That practice has not changed.\"\nFurneisen sees positive changes happening within the justice system as cases like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being brought back, gain national attention.\n\"Just because you're being charged with a crime doesn't mean you did it,\" she said. \"I love my job in helping those who don't have a voice and being an advocate for them.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
