    "content": "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy stated, \"We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay,\" following the release of urgent safety recommendations regarding helicopter flights near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy accepted the recommendations, noting \"And why this information wasn't studied and known before January 29 is an important question.\" The NTSB is still in \"the fact-finding phase\" of its investigation, with Homendy explaining, \"We still have a lot of work to do in this investigation, so the report contains only the facts that we're able to validate and release at this time,\" and \"The easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why.\" Duffy criticized the current air traffic control system as \"antiquated\" and pledged to propose a new system, saying \"We're at a point where we can do this fast\u2014three and a half to four years for a brand new air traffic control system... It will greatly improve our safety\u2026but it's also going to improve the efficiency that we have in American air travel.\" Homendy reassured travelers, stating \"I just flew with my daughter out of DCA\u2026aviation is incredibly safe,\" but also noted \"However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero.\"",

But I also know that putting in sidewalks is not as easy as saying, 'We want a sidewalk.'\" Commission President Tom Costigan agreed that a speed study could be considered, saying \"It's not an easy process... But it's one we can certainly look into and try.\" The proposed speed study would provide a report \"that details the steps and reasoning used to establish the recommended speed limits.\" Costigan speculated about the potential outcome, saying \"And who knows, they may even like it\" after a \"period of education.\"",

The primary objective when we purchased this was the fact that it's 6.48 acres, in the middle of Four Corners, which is where we're growing and where our primary routes are.\"",

Del. Greg Wims plans to introduce a bill, dubbed \"the Sgt.

Rose noted that \"currently, Charles County is the only jurisdiction that participates in this program,\" and that House Bill 1092 \"would make it mandatory for 911 centers to provide, not necessarily this particular program, but one similar to it.\" Commissioner Ralph E.

A 12-year-old middle-schooler, Evelyn Klotz, was celebrated for being the youngest to publish a fantasy novel, \"Hero of Draconis,\" and spoke to a sold-out audience at the Flying Cloud Bookstore about her work. Other top stories included a bank robbery, human remains found on a farm, and a serious crash on Route 50. The list was compiled based on page views as of Wednesday evening. The Department of Homeland Security's list that included Talbot and Queen Anne's counties was removed a few days after it was published.",

But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County,\" and added \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\" The names of the fallen heroes were read, including \"Buck\" Clough and \"Dougie\" Thomas. Queen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson spoke about stoicism, saying \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\" A radio transmission echoed \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Rev. Karen Handy closed with a prayer, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons.

According to Delmarva Power, \"Due to the extent of the repairs, we were able to restore 850 customers in just over two hours, with the remaining 300 customers restored two hours later, just before 1 p.m.\" Caroline County Commissioners President Travis Breeding said, \"Delmarva Power's intergovernmental affairs liaison reached out to me,\" and kept him updated on the progress. The power outage caused disruptions in schools, with Breeding noting \"I know it. It caused some havoc in a few of our schools, Breeding said.\" Caroline County and the town of Denton offered warming shelters, but none were utilized. Delmarva Power restored power to the area around 1 p.m., with Choptank Electric confirming all their customers had power restored by 1:45 p.m.",

According to Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, \"I really didn't want to go down the road because I didn't want to be challenged in the courtroom.\" Easton Police Department's Lt. Tim Larrimore notes that \"This odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search. Now that's out,\" and now they need dogs that can detect other substances, stating \"It's the dog that gets you there.\" Sergeant Scott Lockerman of the Maryland Police K9 Foundation says \"Most of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\" while Dorchester County Sheriff James Phillips remarks that \"We saw it coming, It was on the horizon,\" and finds the community's generosity in donating dogs \"mind-boggling.\" Phillips adds that having K-9s \"completes the police agency\" and pays off \"10 times over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people,\" with Sgt. Steve Twilley noting that K-9s help build trust with kids, saying \"Next thing you know, that kid's come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school.\" Pfc. Mark Schinault describes K-9 Knox as driven, stating \"That means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\" Larrimore notes that the cost of caring for retired K-9s \"hasn't hit us yet,\" as \"These dogs are just retired last year. They're young, they're healthy.\" Phillips and others agree that K-9 units are essential, with Phillips stating \"I think an agency that's trying to do today's police work and doesn't have the K-9 ability out there, I don't think they're a full police agency,\" and \"I think it completes the police agency by having the K-9s.\"",

    "content": "A Chestertown pediatrician, Julio Ramirez, has surrendered his license to practice in Maryland amid allegations of abuse. Four former employees of Ramirez \"all testified to a pervasive environment of sexually abusive, unethical, and inappropriate behavior,\" according to an investigation report. The Maryland State Board of Physicians ordered a summary suspension of Ramirez's license, concluding \"the public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action in this case.\" Ramirez's practice had aimed \"to better serve the Queen Anne's and neighboring communities.\" Attorneys for a woman suing Ramirez stated, \"As alleged in the Complaint, Dr. Ramirez was a serial abuser of women. Our office is actively investigating these instances of abuse, especially against mothers who were assaulted while the doctor was treating their children. It goes without saying that this behavior is not acceptable, and we intend to hold the doctor accountable for his actions. We encourage anyone with information on these allegations to reach out to us.\" Upon closing his practice, Ramirez announced, \"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my office has closed permanently. Due to unforeseen circumstances, and after careful deliberation, I have decided to retire and close my practice... I would like to thank you for your time and the trust you have given me during our many years of operation in Chestertown. Taking care of your family was an honor and a privilege for me and my staff.\"",

Theresa Stafford identified poverty as a \"lead driver\" for issues in Cambridge, advocating for better-paying jobs and education to combat crime, saying \"Bringing in industries or businesses that will pay good wages, and of course, supporting getting kids educated because that's the other key driver that keeps driving up the crime.\"",

Henry's release will be followed by three years of supervised probation.

She had so much love to give and was never stingy with her affection\" and that she became an EMT \"after she saw a lady collapse from a seizure.\" Others remembered their loved ones, including Katelyn Shannon, who said of her cousin Autumn Jenkins, \"sits in front of a telephone pole. We have a stone that was engraved with a drawing of a dog and the fire shield... We actively attend DUI checkpoints conducted by the La Plata Police Department in memory of her.\" Jonna Jones remembered Lauren Pitt, saying \"Her enthusiasm for people made me feel like I could do anything... Such a bright, positive person. We lost a bright light when she passed\" and that \"This year it will be 10 years, that's hard to believe.\" Kandia Spain remembered her son Zachary, a \"gifted swimmer,\" and said \"I keep flowers all year round attached to the utility pole.\" A friend of Brysen Carter wrote, \"I miss you every day, Lil Bro.\" The State Highway Administration's Daniel Allman stated that \"State Highway Administration does not track memorials that are placed along state highways in memory of crash victims\" and that roadside memorials \"could pose safety and maintenance concerns for motorists, pedestrians and highway workers.\"",

The settlement \"makes necessary changes to the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's process for autopsies conducted on people killed in law enforcement custody and requires notification to families about the results and their rights to challenge the results.\" Richard Potter, founder of the Coalition for Justice for Anton Black, called the settlement an \"excellent first step\" and said, \"I hope that with this settlement agencies will begin to recognize their own wrongdoings... What is needed is a sense of shared ownership that can only come through trust and mutual accountability, with police confronting their own biases about mental illness, committing to de-escalation, and truly serving a diverse community.\" Sonia Kumar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland, described the settlement as \"hardfought\" and said, \"We can't prevent such deaths if we aren't honest about what caused them, and this settlement is a crucial step towards that goal in future cases... We hope this settlement will make a real, positive impact, but it is truly just the beginning of the reckoning needed to address decades of misrepresentations so we can bring justice to families still waiting for the government to tell the truth.\" The reforms also aim to instill \"independence from improper law enforcement influence.\"",

Other tips include taking a boating safety course, filing a float plan, and being aware of carbon monoxide poisoning from gasoline-powered engines. Boaters are also advised not to drink while boating, as \"alcohol was listed as a leading factor in boating-related deaths\" where the primary cause was known.",

Capt. John Bollinger emphasized the need for \"frequent reminders that seeking help is not a sign of weakness,\" and noted that negative views of police, fueled by \"bad actions of a few police officers,\" can impact officers' morale, saying \"Too many citizens nationwide believe police officers are generally bad people,\" and \"It's challenging to put on a police uniform and feel or just assume there is just disdain for you just as a result of your profession.\" However, \"Individuals know in their own hearts that the great majority of police get involved because they want to help people,\" Bollinger added, and Capt. Bollinger also said \"I am old school, 43 years on the job, so this was difficult for me to learn, but being in a command position changes your perspective when looking out for the welfare of your people.\" The Eau Claire Community Foundation's effort to reimburse local law enforcement officers for mental health expenses states that \"The fund was recently established to reimburse local law enforcement personnel for mental health expenses not covered by their health insurance; grants will be paid directly to the Eau Claire County Sheriff's Department (since we can't make grants to individuals) and applied to their requests for reimbursement.\"",

I saw everything.\" McCarthy's credibility was questioned by the defense, with Snyder's lawyer, Joshua Insley, highlighting that she initially didn't mention Snyder throwing a punch, admitting \"I was covering a little bit for my boyfriend.\" Insley also asked McCarthy, \"Ever smoke crack before,\" and noted that Cimorose had various drugs in his system, as well as referencing the object Cimorose possessed, accusing investigators of \"sugar-coating\" its description. When Insley asked McCarthy if her cooperation was related to dismissing drug cases against her, she responded, \"Drugs has nothing to do with this case,\" and Insley followed up by saying \"I heard it makes you pretty wacky.\"",

A major winter storm is expected to bring snow and ice \"from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic\" this weekend. Van Emburgh noted that the town is preparing by putting plows on trucks and loading salt, and \"And we have equipment that we're placing around town that we'll use to address alleys and some of the tighter spots that we plow.\" Residents are advised to take precautions, such as having a \"supply of fresh water in case the power goes out and you're on well water and therefore you rely on the power for your water source,\" as suggested by Dorchester County Emergency Management Division Director Jimmy Windsor. Van Emburgh also requested that residents not park on main streets, as \"When people park on the streets, we have to plow around the cars and sometimes that can \u2014 depending on how much snow we get \u2014 that can get tricky and then we plow the cars in.\" Additionally, Van Emburgh advised residents to clear snow from sidewalks by plowing it away from the street, saying \"Because we then plow it back onto the sidewalk... It's just a battle. (Residents) plow it onto the street. We plow it back onto the sidewalk. And they get mad at us\" and \"Some properties don't have yards... But if you plow it out in the street, it's just going to get pushed back onto the sidewalk. So we ask that everything moves away from the center of the street.\"",

    "content": "Bob Spanburgh, Maryland ABATE's board chairman, said \"It's been 32 years this year to no avail,\" but the group continues to push for a bill that would make wearing a helmet optional, named in honor of Gary \"Pappy\" Boward. Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett and Washington) believes \"we as government do better when we educate people, (rather) than legislating something,\" and supports giving people the choice to wear a helmet. Spanburgh was turned into an activist by ABATE, recalling \"At the first meeting I went to, the thing they told me (was), 'You got to register to vote. It's very important in this organization,'\" and \"That was actually the first time I ever registered to vote in my life. I was 27 at the time.\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's) praised ABATE, saying \"They're diehards for what they believe in,\" and \"Thank God they do. They don't let go of this stuff.\" Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, argued that not wearing a helmet \"ends up costing the entire system a whole lot of money.\" Ken Eaton, Maryland ABATE's executive director, vowed to continue pushing the bill, saying \"If I don't do it, who else is going to do it?\" Meanwhile, Spanburgh noted \"We have some pretty ardent supporters. We have a lot of people who think we're nuts, probably,\" and Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City) said \"I don't agree with them that they shouldn't wear a helmet, but I do agree about the civil liberty issue.\" The bill is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. \"But we keep introducing it,\" Spanburgh said, and proponents vow they won't stop trying if it's unsuccessful.",

    "content": "Security experts and law enforcement officials are advising houses of worship to be proactive about security due to a rise in violent incidents, with 57% of American Jews saying they \"believe that antisemitism is now a normal Jewish experience.\" Dan Skoczylas, vice president of CLS Background Investigations, said \"All of the houses of worship should consider themselves to be high-risk targets at this point,\" and noted that some are considering metal detectors and increased staffing. The Lee County Sheriff's Office \"continues to maintain vigilance and security\" and conducts frequent area checks, with public information officer Julie Sin stating \"We have hundreds of individual places of worship and religious centers within Lee County. Deputies are familiar with those in their patrol sectors and conduct frequent area checks \u2014 this is standard practice.\" Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response LLC, said some facilities are adjusting access points and adding security checkpoints, while Cathal Walsh of Guidepost Solutions suggested houses of worship look at entrances and exits for vulnerabilities. Temple B'nai Israel in Easton, Maryland, has implemented various security measures, including a gated parking area, magnetic locks, and security cameras, saying \"We take security very seriously,\" due to \"the considerable uptick of anti-Semitic threats violence.\" The Council on American-Islamic Relations has published a best practices guide for mosques, recommending a \"vigilant\" security staff that can give early warnings to congregants and approach suspicious individuals. Walsh also noted that there are federal grants available to help nonprofits and religious venues upgrade their security infrastructure, saying \"You might receive the funding to install more security cameras.\" Gene Petrino emphasized the need for a visible deterrent while maintaining a welcoming environment, stating \"The goal is a visible deterrent while maintaining a welcoming environment.\" Skoczylas cautioned that social media presents a challenge, saying \"Social media is very touchy, it's the conduit of all things good and bad.\" Additionally, there have been incidents of \"swatting,\" and law enforcement agencies are providing \"threat assessment\" and \"criminal intelligence\" to investigate threats.",

Many schools in the eclipse path will be closed on April 8, and police, fire departments, and hospitals may see increased volumes.

Kyleigh always seemed to be upbeat, like nothing was impossible.\" The fire that killed Kyleigh on Christmas morning was investigated by Deputy State Fire Marshals, who reported that \"upon arrival, firefighters found the family standing outside their home, stating a young girl was still inside\" and that the medical examiner attributed Kyleigh's death to \"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation.\" A GoFundMe page was set up to benefit Kyleigh's surviving family, with donations totaling $17,414 as of Thursday afternoon, with Theresa Retz saying \"People have been awesome. In addition to (monetary) donations, there has been an avalanche of donated clothing,\" and that Kyleigh's mother \"has to be strong, particularly for Ethan, who is now her youngest child.\" A community member, Kathi, visited the scene, leaving a teddy bear and saying \"I did not know Kyleigh and I do not know her family, but I just wanted to come here today.\"",

Police charging documents described camera footage from the park showing \"sounds of loud thuds ... consistent with forceful strikes\" and a man \"carrying and dragging\" a woman's body to a vehicle. Defense attorney Matt Connell acknowledged Bradley's involvement in Britt's death, saying \"He lost it. He hit her too hard, and she died,\" and urged the jury to \"Hold him responsible for what he's really guilty of, not above and beyond that.\" Britt's mother, Linda Harris, testified emotionally, stating \"She wouldn't miss anything,\" regarding her daughter's absence from family events. The defense objected to some audio evidence, with Connell stating \"We are fine acknowledging that that was him in the video,\" and noting that \"90% of the verbal communication occurred inside the vehicle,\" while also saying \"it's possible I'm mistaken.\" The judge ruled it \"quite likely\" the court will allow the video's admission, describing some of the audio as \"chilling\" and noting a potential \"reasonable expectation\" for privacy was not a valid objection.",

    "content": "Ridgely commissioners voted unanimously to continue the town's memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office. Commissioner Brad Sears stated, \"I think at this point we're to a point where we would entertain a motion to give the town authorization to meet with the county to negotiate any changes to the MOU and go from there.\" The decision came after discussing three options, including reverting to the sheriff's department regular patrol pattern, re-establishing an original police force estimated at $852,000 for the first year, as noted by Sears, who said, \"I know last month we talked about three options, one completely going back to the sheriff's department regular patrol pattern... Second was to attempt to re-establish an original police force, and even that price was conservatively estimated at $852,000 for the first year if we could find the police officer.\" Sheriff Donald Baker supported the MOU, stating, \"The sheriff's office is providing what is going to be a high quality of law enforcement in the town,\" and clarified that the town receives comprehensive services, saying, \"The town going with the MOU with the sheriff's office, they get everything the sheriff's office has to provide as far as criminal investigations handled by a investigator or detective, as well as the sheriff's office is a member of the Caroline County Drug Task Force and we have two deputies assigned to that.\" Baker also addressed resident concerns, saying, \"There was some confusion that this money is dumped right into the Sheriff's Office budget. That's not true,\" and explaining that the county bills the town based on usage, stating, \"The county is billing the town based upon the usage. So, if we don't use something or there's money left over, the county does not bill it and it goes back to the town or the town keeps it and it's never filled.\" This decision follows an investigation by the Office of the State Prosecutor, which found no \"sufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution.\"",

Graham Norbury, chief of the Oxford Fire Company, said, \"We do a lot of mutual aid to other departments in the area and elsewhere.\" Tim Kearns, president of Oxford Fire Company, explained that the volunteer system relies on mutual aid, stating, \"It was important because the volunteer system works on mutual aid, so when someone is overwhelmed, we come to help,\" and \"And that's what we did, only they're just a little farther away than most.\" The effort required significant coordination, with Kearns noting, \"It took a lot of folks to coordinate and manhandle the transfer of this equipment, from the paperwork, insurances, transfer of titles and tags, to all of the logistics here, there and in between,\" and crediting Chief Engineer Stacy Dulin and Assistant Chief Engineers Mike Greenwak and Tom Bixler for ensuring the equipment was capable of the 500-mile trip, with Oxford Ferry loaning the heavy trailer. Multiple Maryland fire companies, including Oxford, Tilghman, and others, contributed to the effort.",

William Folden, who argued, \"The irony is, if we see someone chugging a beer, police can pull them over,\" and that the law takes away probable cause when \"there is a crime occurring, just because you're saying, well, you're not allowed to use your nose anymore.\" Del. Jheanelle Wilkins noted that the original law aimed to address \"the harms of the past when it comes to criminalization of cannabis.\" Sen. Jack Bailey countered, \"The public clearly wanted marijuana legalized, fine,\" but argued that requirements should not be done away with, saying \"but we shouldn't do away with the requirements.\" Ferguson described the initial cannabis bill as complex, stating, \"It was hugely complicated, lots of moving pieces for the cannabis bill last year.\"",

She must go back to Delaware immediately (after the adjudication of her Cecil County murder case).\" According to court records, Randle allegedly told investigators that she asked her boyfriend, Cedrick Antoine Britten, to dispose of her daughter's body, and Britten \"produced a map of where he believed that Randle may have disposed of\" the body. Investigators found human remains \"consistent with an emaciated child\" inside a suitcase in a vacant lot, which were later identified as those of Nola Dinkins, the 3-year-old daughter of Randle.",

Kazeem Anifowoshe, GIS senior data analyst, noted that traditional victim services often follow a established formula, saying \"When people kind of think of victim services, there's kind of like a formula that a lot of people have been doing for 20 to 40 plus years at their organization that works for them,\" but the GIS program aims to innovate by \"mapping things.\" Yeager expressed the organization's goal to expand the GIS Hub's adoption, stating \"We ought to work with victims, and we're making this available. Let's see where we're going with it.\" According to Anifowoshe, the approach is centered on making resources more accessible, with the sentiment \"But again, we're just trying to make things easier the best way we know how, by mapping things.\"",

Harris originally faced charges of being an accessory to murder. Kevron Chase, 35, of Cambridge, had already pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the case and is set to be sentenced on July 19. According to charging documents, police said the bar's security camera footage showed Chase handing a gun to Harris before shooting Smith. Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said at Chase's plea hearing that Chase disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River after the shooting.",

Will reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit affirmed a district court's judgment that the family of John King, a murdered inmate, cannot sue to hold anyone at the prison responsible for his death due to \"qualified immunity.\" The court held that there was no \"clearly established law\" forbidding the officials' actions, despite King's family asserting that his death resulted from prison officials' being \"deliberately indifferent\" to the danger he was in, and that officials had \"supervisory liability.\" In the brutal murder, one inmate \"stomped\" on another's ribs, causing them to \"pop.\" Judge James A. Wynn Jr. dissented, arguing that the officials' actions were an \"atrocity\" that occurred because of \"deliberate indifference\" and a \"failure-to-protect\" King from violence at the hands of other prisoners, violating the Eighth Amendment's proscription of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" According to the Supreme Court, \"deliberate indifference\" is established when a prison official \"knew of a substantial risk\" or \"must have known about the risk,\" and \"a prison official cannot hide behind an excuse that he was unaware of a risk, no matter how obvious.\" Will argued that granting qualified immunity in this case constitutes permission for lethal neglect, as it requires King's family to \"pinpoint\" with \"specificity\" a \"precise\" constitutional right violation, and the court claimed \"there is no clearly established constitutional right to properly conducted security checks,\" allowing officials to not act \"knowingly\" to protect prisoners.",

The body remained in the yard for hours due to a delay in transporting it to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, caused by a 16-mile Bay Bridge backup. \"The estimated time of arrival was initially an hour and a half, but due to a 16-mile Bay Bridge back-up, the transport was delayed and didn't arrive until 7 p.m.,\" the town statement said. The family declined offers to move the body back inside or into a body bag.",

But I guess if courts and the police cause kids to go to a jail-like situation, then having their own place is a better situation than being shoehorned into a boys' place.\" The reports also noted that girls were \"ejected\" from programs and faced challenges such as disrupted school, delayed medical care, and increased isolation, with one girl saying \"It's so crazy here. It's so hard to concentrate in school because it is so loud, and loud noises are my trigger\" and another stating \"Me and my child feel threatened.\" JJMU wrote that relegating detained girls to a boys' facility \"indicates a lack of appropriate planning and dedication of resources and arguably demonstrates a casual disregard for the well-being of girls in DJS custody.\"",

Board Chair Mitch Ettinger agreed to include that state-mandated timeline concern in the report, with further discussion scheduled for the Dec. 19 meeting.",

    "content": "A May 2 roof fire that began in solar panels damaged a two-story home on Great Oak Landing Road in Chestertown, with flames first spotted around 5:30 p.m. \"Due to the location and timing of the incident, there was a delayed response,\" said Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company Chief J. Darling. Crews used garden hoses until additional units arrived, then deployed two hand lines\u2014one to the roof fire and one to the attic\u2014keeping flames confined to the second-floor attic and the panel-bearing roof section, according to fire officials. The Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office blamed the solar panels, notified Tesla, and reported no injuries. Eight volunteer companies from Kent and Queen Anne's counties responded. Officials warned, \"As more homes install solar panels, it's important for homeowners to understand the potential fire risks and how to reduce them. While solar panels are generally safe and highly regulated, like any electrical system, they can pose hazards if improperly installed, damaged or affected by environmental factors.\"",

Sellman entered a guilty plea in Queen Anne's County District Court on Nov. 24, 2024, for failing to provide proper shelter for a Cane Corso dog, violating Maryland Criminal Law Article 10-604, Richardson said. In August 2024, county animal control officers responded to an anonymous tip about a dog in distress at Sellman's Thompson Avenue residence, Richardson reported, and found the Cane Corso tethered with a choker collar in direct sunlight without shelter or water; the dog was heavily panting in critical condition, with an external temperature of 121 degrees when the air temperature was 96 degrees. Officers transported the animal to a nearby clinic where it was pronounced dead upon arrival, according to Richardson. Sellman received a suspended jail sentence and supervised probation, as he was already incarcerated on unrelated charges, Richardson said, and his probation conditions prohibit him from owning or possessing animals and require a mental health evaluation.",
