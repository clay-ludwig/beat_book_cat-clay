Ahlstrom brings more than 25 years of nonprofit, community\u2011building and youth\u2011advocacy experience, a Master of Science in Counseling, and recent work as the T.A.M.A.R. coordinator for female detainees in Dorchester and Caroline county detention centers. \u201cI hope to help mitigate the upward trend in Human Trafficking by expanding For All Seasons Rape Crisis Center's outreach; and strengthening the medical, legal, social service, and mental health collaboration that has already been established to support survivors.I believe my counseling and education background, along with strong communication and networking skills will help facilitate the most effective trauma-informed response to serve victims and their families in the Mid-Shore region and beyond,\u201d Ahlstrom said. The story notes the Eastern Shore\u2019s location near major highways, airports and seasonal work makes it attractive to traffickers, and directs readers to WeSupportSurvivors.org or to email Ahlstrom for anti\u2011human\u2011trafficking presentations.",

It comes from neighboring counties.

Council Vice President Pete\u202fLesher concluded, \u201cWe know that even one victim is too many,\u201d Lesher said. \u201cWe appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\u201d",

    "content": "Ernest Anthony Vuocolo, 64, was sentenced to five years in prison for second\u2011degree assault after stabbing his 41\u2011year\u2011old stepson following a Thanksgiving dinner in November\u202f2023, according to Cecil County Circuit Court records. Judge Cameron A. Brown imposed a maximum ten\u2011year term, suspended all but four years, added a consecutive one\u2011year sentence for carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure, a concurrent four\u2011year reckless endangerment sentence, and three years of supervised probation after release. The victim told investigators that he confronted Vuocolo about alleged \u201csexual comments\u201d regarding his wife and was attacked, saying Vuocolo held him in a headlock and stabbed him in the chest; deputies at the scene reported the victim was \u201cbleeding heavily\u201d from his left side. Police said they responded to a complaint about a \u201cphysical domestic involving a knife,\u201d recovered a six\u2011inch \u201cthick blade\u201d knife that was later described at trial as \u201cfield clever,\u201d and treated Vuocolo for chest pain before returning him to custody. A jury convicted Vuocolo of the three charges but acquitted him of first\u2011degree assault, the most serious charge, with Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Gavin\u202fPatashnick prosecuting and defense attorneys Tina Harris\u202fSchlecker and C.\u202fThomas\u202fBrown representing him.",

Judge Cameron A. Brown imposed a maximum ten\u2011year term, suspended all but four years, added a consecutive one\u2011year sentence for carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure, a concurrent four\u2011year reckless endangerment sentence, and three years of supervised probation after release. The victim told investigators that he confronted Vuocolo about alleged \u201csexual comments\u201d regarding his wife and was attacked, saying Vuocolo held him in a headlock and stabbed him in the chest; deputies at the scene reported the victim was \u201cbleeding heavily\u201d from his left side. Police said they responded to a complaint about a \u201cphysical domestic involving a knife,\u201d recovered a six\u2011inch \u201cthick blade\u201d knife that was later described at trial as \u201cfield clever,\u201d and treated Vuocolo for chest pain before returning him to custody. A jury convicted Vuocolo of the three charges but acquitted him of first\u2011degree assault, the most serious charge, with Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Gavin\u202fPatashnick prosecuting and defense attorneys Tina Harris\u202fSchlecker and C.\u202fThomas\u202fBrown representing him.",

He added, \u201cBecause if you send them back home to that same environment, ain\u2019t nothing going to happen,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together\u201d rather than let the council be \u201ccontrolled by 25 kids.\u201d Mayor Stephen Rideout had vetoed the original juvenile curfew ordinance passed on Aug.\u202f14, leading Sputty Cephas to propose amendments that cut the $100 fine in half to $50, a compromise the mayor agreed to discuss privately. While Commissioner Atkiss pointed out that \u201c$100 is a lot of money for a struggling parent,\u201d the council considered retaining reduced fines as part of the penalty. Presentations by United Way\u2019s Pam Gregory and Let\u2019s Thrive Baltimore\u2019s Lisa Molock highlighted broader socioeconomic factors, and community member Theresa Stafford said, \u201cWe need to get serious about fixing the problem of poverty,\u201d linking economic hardship to the city\u2019s crime surge.",

He added, \u201cBecause if you send them back home to that same environment, ain\u2019t nothing going to happen,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together\u201d rather than let the council be \u201ccontrolled by 25 kids.\u201d Mayor Stephen Rideout had vetoed the original juvenile curfew ordinance passed on Aug.\u202f14, leading Sputty Cephas to propose amendments that cut the $100 fine in half to $50, a compromise the mayor agreed to discuss privately. While Commissioner Atkiss pointed out that \u201c$100 is a lot of money for a struggling parent,\u201d the council considered retaining reduced fines as part of the penalty. Presentations by United Way\u2019s Pam Gregory and Let\u2019s Thrive Baltimore\u2019s Lisa Molock highlighted broader socioeconomic factors, and community member Theresa Stafford said, \u201cWe need to get serious about fixing the problem of poverty,\u201d linking economic hardship to the city\u2019s crime surge.",
